I know what it means!
I'm not telling you.
That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...
...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.
...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.
Weeaak!
Then I was lying on a table...
...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes.
What?
No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.
Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.
Kick ass.
Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!
Oh!
Oh!
No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?
No!
Shut up, dildo!
Oh!
God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!
Shut up!
Shut up you guys, it's not working.
Heh, somebody's baking brownies.
Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.
Ow! My ass!
No, that was just a dream.
No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.
Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.
I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
Or slip her the tongue.
You are making it up.
What?
Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!
Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!
I would if I could, you son of a bitch!
UhWould you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control!
Ah, son of a bitch!
You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control.
Uh...
Hey...
No!
He's not dead.
Shut up, you guys.
Hi, Mom.
Well, I'm pissed off!
I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
That's what I said.
No!
Uh, Mom?
If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?
Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.
Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.
No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie.
No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!
No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!
Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
No, Kitty, you can't have any!
No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!
Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty.
Dude, weak mom.
I can't, my mom said...
God damn it!
You guys, I have to get home.
Oh, man, this sucks.
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
I don't wanna.
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!
I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
Sure, you guys, what-ever.
You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!
Oh, God damn it!
What the hell are they talking about?
You guys, get me down from here!
Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
Puh!
Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.
Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.
Ahh, son of a bitch!
Ugh, I hate those things.
I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!
Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it.
Nothing..!
What?
Kick ass!
Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted.
Oh, you know, this and that.
There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?
You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.
Hey!
That kid is me.
Me! Eric Cartman!
Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.
Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?
Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!
I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
Screw you, hippie!
Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.
Yes!
Beefcake!
Beefcake!
Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?
But mom, I need it for tomorrow.
Hey dudes.
Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?
I'm up to 94, thank you very much.
Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff.
Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.
Ey! I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!
Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.
Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.
I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
No they don't, you jealous weakling!
Hey!
Oh look, another hippie.
Peace, Wendy.
This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.
You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eihh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.
Cartman, God damn it.
Here it is, my big moment of fame.
Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
When is this going to be on the air?
Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
Okay, Mom.
Dude, that's sick mom.
Drive, Drive!
Drive the car damn-it, drive!
Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.
You piece of crap, I'll kill you!
Eeeeenh!
Hey, I didn't get a gun.
Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.
My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
Democrats piss me off!
Kickass!!
Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.
Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!
I got your back, soldier.
Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.
I can shoot you too!
I'll fill you full of lead!
My weenies won't cook.
Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah.
Heh, tha-that's not scary.
Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!
Hey, you would taste my pee!
Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has...
No! A piece of celery.
Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy.
Hey, it might be!
Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell!
I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
Holy crap!
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Hey, wait, aah!
You guys, it's just me.
Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume.
You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
Hey, seriously you guys!
Hey!
Goddammit, don't shoot me!
I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
Help!
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
Eh. You're making me sick, dude.
No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!
I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
That dog is a gay homosexual.
What's homecoming?
There he goes again.
Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
Ah, dammit!
Eeyy!
Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?
That's not fair!
Stupid puppet.
You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.
Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen.
He still looks pretty gay to me.
There he goes!
No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France.
Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
We'll just see about that.
No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
That's right, you get back there.
Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man.
Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
Your sister beat you up again, huh?
Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.
I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"
Be a man Stan. Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."
That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.
Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no!
Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"
It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway.
Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
I'll kick you in the nuts!
Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.
Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!
That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!
What?
Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!
Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.
Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?
I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
What!
Hey!
You piece of crap! I'll kill you!
Don't talk about my mom like that!
Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!
Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.
Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!
Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.
Oh, biiitch.
Yourmomis--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.
Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.
Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.
Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny.
Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.
I don't know.
Why don't we just shoot him?
Aaaah, runrunruuun!
Ehh, eh, ehhhh!
Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on.
You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!
Ohhh, God, No!
My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
Yeah!
What the hell is that thing?
There's no such thing as UFOs.
Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.
Hey, dudes.
It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.
My mom made it, isn't it cool?
What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?
Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool.
Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off!
Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.
I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!
I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!
Poor piece of crap.
There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
What?! What did you say?
Eating Kenny's pudding.
Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.
That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.
My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!
Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o.
Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!
I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.
Boo! I'm a ghost.
Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.
Hey Chef.
Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?
What is that?
Who?
Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.
Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.
Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking.
God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!
Check.
Yeah, granola pisses me off.
Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.
Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.
I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!
I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.
Hi Wendy.
You what?! Are you insane?!
How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.
You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!
Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.
One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
Can we have some candy now please?!
I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!
Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!
Aaah!
It was Kyle.
Remember candy, focus on the candy.
Eh, shit...
You guys, shit...
It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
Hey, there's a pay phone!
Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!
Aaah, kew!
Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!
Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
Kill her Stan!
Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!
Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way.
Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.
Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.
Lehh, eh, screw you guys!
Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
Yeah, HEY!
That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?
KICK ASS!!
When do we get the sports watch?
You vas-deferens!
I get to wear it first, you guys.
Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.
When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!
Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!
Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!
I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?
What the hell?
Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.
Hey mooom?
We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?
Sweet.
Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
Ahh!
Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.
Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?
You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers.
Oh yeah, you're right.
Yeah, that's right.
No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.
No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!
Oh well, back to the poor country with you.
B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.
Hey, hey, what's going on?!
Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!
Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!
Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!
I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.
Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?
Well, screw you too!
What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!
Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.
Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!
I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
What?!
But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
WEEEEEEAK!!!
Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...
I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.
Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.
Huh, I wonder what's in here?
SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!
Sally Struthers?!
Gimme that cake!
No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!
You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!!
That's right you will, God-Damnit.
Move it POVs, I'm an American!
Oohhhh!
Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.
What the hell is Christmas Poo?
Hey!
What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now.
You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle.
Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!
Let me see!
Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.
Gross, Kyle!
YOU SICK BASTARD!
Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah!
Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home!
Talking poo is where I draw the line!
Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you!
Yeah, something feels...unfinished.
Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
That's right.
I shoved it up my ass!
Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...
No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.
Eeeeeeh!
Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?
Byah. Oof!
Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?
Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!
Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.
Eeyy!
Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!
Cartman's birthday!
You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!
Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.
You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
Aah! AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's it! Party is over!
Everybody go home!
GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT!
Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!
Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
Oh man, I...
Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.
Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.
She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me!
Until you puked on her.
I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners
Boooriing.
Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it.
Okay, ready? I'll go first.
Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it.
Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?
You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.
Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?
Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.
Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey.
My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.
That's niiice, Peter Panda.

Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?
Eeeyy!
No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!
No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!
Mom? Can I ask you a question?
You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?
And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?
God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
I want to know where I came from.
Uh huuh.
So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?
Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American.
No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!
Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!
Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation.
My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?
Hiya, Dad!
I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Liane Cartman.
Whatooya mean?
Huh??
Eeyy!!
Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.
Yo, Pops!
You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?
Westsa-eed-eh.
You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance.
He said you kissed her with your tongue.
No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
Really? You don't think so?
All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!
It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!
Then you did sleep with my mom?
How much?
I don't have $3000.
Oh, fine. How are you guys?
Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.
Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000.
Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...
Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.
You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!
What kind of video did you guys make?
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.
He's my father?!
Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.
Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
You've got to be kidding me!
Eeeehh..!
Is he awake yet?
They can't. Mephesto can't die.
No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.
Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
No! Don't!
Eh--
Yeah, stop being a wuss!
Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
Wake up, you son of a bitch!
I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
What?
What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
Sweet.
Hey, who's screwing with the lights?
Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.
What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?
Go, Kenny!
Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop.
Just tell us already!
Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.
Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!
Ooohhh, forget it!
Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.
I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these.
Oooaaagh.
I'm prepared!
God-dammit!
Really? I wanna be a cop.
Do I get a nightstick?
Ey!
I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
Step out of the car, please, sir.
Get your ass to jail!
Well, hi there.
Sir, step out of the car, please.
Sir, could you step out of the car, please?
And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?
Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a...
Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh.
Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!
Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!
A-ha!
Ooohhhh.
Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.
M'kay?
What the hell is a "bris"?
Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!
I wonder who took it.
I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.
Wo-what's that?
Ham?
Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?
Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.
Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!
What the hell is gahekgafuga?
No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!
Is that why it stinks so bad?
No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
Eech.
Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!
Fireman!
Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.
Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!
Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?
No way, I set up mine first, hippie!
Okay?
Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.
Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?
Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?
Who the hell cares what it's called? As long as she doesn't have to touch me...
AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
Heyh! They have a zoo there!
Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.
I caught it, I caught it!
Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumb-ass European hippie piece of crap.
My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh?
I dunno.
Come on, rice picker!
Holy crap!
I love you guys.
Ah, screw you guys!
What?
Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
All done!
Ms. Crabtree?
Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip!
Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!
Okay, that's it!
Screw you guys! I'm going home.
What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
Stan?
Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
Ugh... Whatever.
Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?
It is not!
I am not swimming around in pee!
My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.
I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
Eh-eh-eh-eh...
Nuh-uh.
I don't wanna.
Egh--
Huh? First graders?
Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!
Later's fine.
I only know how to do it doggie style.
Can I do it doggie style?
Sweet..!
Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!
No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
Fine.
Well, you heard wrong, hippie!
Where is Chef?
Wow.
Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.
Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it.
I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.
I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!
Huh?
Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..!
How's it going?
No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.
Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!
I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!
...bitch.
I'm going!
I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.
Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.
It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?
Yeah!
Ay!
Okay, that's enough fat-ass jokes for this week.
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home.
Aw, man, smells like ass down here.
Aw, man, let's get out of here!
What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home.
No.
Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess.
All of us?
Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.
Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95!
Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
Whoa!
Yes. And I've learned something, too.
Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.
No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.
Oh weak!
What?
Oh, good. I'm starving.
Pfff..!
Puh! I heard that.
Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?
It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!
Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.
I don't wanna.
Ey, give me that!
Ahhhh...
More calamine lotion!
Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!
No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!
Uh. Yes. Uh...
"I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."
Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."
I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
She what?!
That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
Hell no, you guys get your own!
Hooray!
Well, I know one thing for sure.
Planetariums suck!
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
Hey, there it is!
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behind my back!
But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
How long is that Cheesy Poofs van gonna be outside?
As if we care.
Aw man, screw this.
Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!
Eric Cartman.
Thaat's right, suck on that.
I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!
Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
Hey, be careful, asshole!
Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams.
Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?
Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?
Apparently, only I do.
Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion.
It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!
I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!
Sike!
I know, I know!
Thank you.
I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!
I'm over here.
Aay!
Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake!
Oh, man, c'mon!
What?!
Oh, God damnit!
Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric.
I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.
Okay, bye.
Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch.
Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
Oh, dude, here it comes!
Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!
Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!
Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!
You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!
Planetariums suck ass!
What the hell are you talking about?
God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!
What is this? Halt!
It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--
--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.
That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!
What?
What are you guys doing?
That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!
Fine!
Fine! That's fine.
Fine!
No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!
Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker.
No, Kenny.
Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!
Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.
And stop your bitchin'!
So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?
Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.
Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.
Oh, man!
And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.
All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.
Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!
What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?
Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?
Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?
Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.
It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.
Ahaw, that's weak.
That's killer.
That's totally weak!
Sweet.
Killer weak, sweet!
I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"
Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!
Who the hell are you?!
How many people?
Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
This is bullcrap!
This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Wwow!
Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
That's easy!
Ay! Check it out!
Damn it!
Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!
I'd like to see you do better!
I only have three dollars left, asshole!
Sweet.
I only need one, dude. I only need one.
How much is it?
Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over.
I'm right!
Eh! God-damnit!
Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.
Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!
I think we're almost to the end.
How much?
Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet.
What? This is cool.
It is, too!
Aah, three dollars.
Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.
Ey! Seriously!
Well, I'm sorry!
Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!
Sweet.
What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
O-kay, I'll get on the bull.
I guess, damn!
Hey, this is sweet.
I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
Ye-gah!
Ow!
Son of a bitch!
Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
All right, get down. This is my kind of bull-ride.
Yeah, this is sweet!
Eeyy!
Ey! Seriously, you guys! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!
Mother f-
Yeah, I cant get this stupid song out of my head.
Its all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.
You wrote it?
Yeah, and hes Jewish.
What's a "Chewbacca defense"?
Goddamn, I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, "Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"
Wow, hes good.
Ready.
What's that?
No, it isn't, you guys.
We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.
Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies...
What?!
Three Crispy Yum Yums.
Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.
Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated hyeeah.
Four.
Yeah!
Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
Ha-ha, you're a wuss.
Hey guys. How's it going?
I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed
I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
You guys are just hella jealous.
It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!
Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.
Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!
What do you mean, what am I doing?! I'm just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.
Why the hell not?!
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Dude, this is hella weird.
Dude, this is hella cool.
Who's "we"? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!
Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!
Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?
Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!
Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!
All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!
What?!
Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.
Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?
Yeah, that's fine.
Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?
Heheh, you suck, Kenny.
Come 'ere, crocky.
I'm right here, Kyle.
Screw you, hippie!
Aww, screw you guys anyway!
For what?
I think we're almost there, you guys.
Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.
Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!
Sweet.
Killer.
Fine.
Well, I don't see any crocs out here.
You son of a bitch cat!
Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face.
He might have been, by crikey.
Wow! Kick ass!
Yeah, I think the same thing.
Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.
They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.
Okay.
What if you don't have any rhythm?
Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
Whoopee.
Yeah, pretty much.
Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
Why?
Eh-heheh!
I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!
Y taco.
Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
I'm going this way!
I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
What the hell happened to him?
I'm gonna be Jesus!
Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
Peter!
Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
Yes.
Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
They look exactly the same.
I don't know, two!
Uh, one.
Ow! I hate you!
My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
Bitch, I hate that bitch!
So, what does that mean?
I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
Ow! Son of a bitch!
Ey!
Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.
Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?
Oh, no!
Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.
But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
Hey! You son of a bitch!
That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?
What? What happened?
I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
Eh-sure.
I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
I have to go number two.
No way, dude! What would I wipe with?
Well what do I sit on?
Stop, you guys! I can't think!
Told ya!
Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
Five bucks.
Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
Those sons of bitches!
Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?
Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
Come on!
What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
Fine, that's fine!
I win!
The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
Come on, Craig!
When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.
Are you okay, Salma Hayek?
But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek.
No, Kitty! I don't have anything!
What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!
Aw, Ma.
You're not allowed to have people over!
Ey! I need to use the phone!
Who the hell are you?
You know this guy?
Christ, he's like 50 years old!
Dude, that's not cool.
I'm gonna tell my mom on you.
Ey! You ate all the pizza!
Give me that phone number!
I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
Oh! God dammit!
Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
What?? Ih- is she okay?
Aw, man, you guys suck.
You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!
Okay. See you in a while.
Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly.
Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
Yuh, you mean it?
That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
You're not ugly.
Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
If you want, I could help you.
Just let me get my cowboy hat.
We don't have much time!
Hurry up in there!
That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!
Yeah. I think we get along okay.
Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.
Christmastime is presents for me.
Cool!
Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!
We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.
God-damnit, mom!
How?
So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
This is gonna be fun!
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "You-hoo"...
Heh heh, I'm sweet.
We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: "Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"
[walks up with the doll and jingles] Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!
Nno Grandma.
Nno Grandma.
Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.
How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
Wow, cool!
That didn't help at all.
No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!
Yes.
Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!
Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!
Sweet.
Hey, dick-whore. I guess you saw the commercial, too.
C'mon.
C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--
C'mon.
C'mon. Give me Pengin!
C'mon!
Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.
God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!
Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.
Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.
It's all Chinpokomon now.
You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
Duhhh!
Duhhh!
Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.
Cool! This game rules!
I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
I haven't made any money yet.
Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!
Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!
Like, eight days ago.
Get outta the way! Move it!
Ohhh.
Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
...Gay.
Gay.
Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.
Where are you going, Stan?
Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!
You're going down, bitch!
Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
What?! What the fuck that that mean?
Uuh. Definition?
Country of origin?
Could you please use it in a sentence?
How come you don't go to school?
You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?
Ey! How come you never pick me?!
Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door.
Mom?
Could you turn up the heat just a little?
You're damn straight, he did.
Now you're gettin' it.
Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
Oh, dude, this is not cool!
No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.
Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!
Whoa, cool.
Totally!
Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.
Oh. We don't know him.
Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.
Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.
Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!
No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.
Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
No, never. It's perfect.
Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!
U-u-huh. I don't remember.
Holy shit!
It's Sally Struthers!
Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
She bought it.
Alright,
Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.
What? We're not gonna come visit him.
I'm playing the drum.
I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
Ey, I'll get it!
Yes I will!
Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, dammit!
What?
No way! Flutes are totally gay!
Later.
Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.
Yes we are!
Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
Right.
Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
But why? Why should they get the bell?
God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
No. I say we take Topeka.
Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
God, I hate you guys!
Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.
Yes! Yes!
Take the fort!
Suck my ass!
We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
I knew they would!
Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
What the hell are you guys doing?!
What?!
No! We still have to fight!
NOOO!!
Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit!
Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
Hahahaha haa ha!
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
that's why they're lame.
Yes! I really did.
Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
Tampon? What's a tampon?
Ew, doesn't that hurt?
Wow, cool!
All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
What's the matter, Kyle?
...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
Now, the word is "spirituality." I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!
Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
That was pretty cool.
We're trying to find the brown noiseit's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
Aaaa-
How about geebo, or, or mung?
Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
Ooooh.
Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
For one tooth.
Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
All we need is teeth.
How are we gonna get it from him?
Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
Higher, you guys.
Ey!
Bull's eye!
I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
Okay.
Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
I know, huh?
Do you what this means?
You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
I know!
My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
Kyle, open your eyes, man!
Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
No, man, that's just a TV show.
What? That your parents lied to you, too?
How?
Wow, look at the size of these houses!
Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
We were there first!
Man, that is tits!
Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
That's right. Keep the change, my man.
Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
Sure, Kyle.
So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
Kyle?
Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
...Tits.
Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!
Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!
No way!
...What the hell is a hate crime?
What? A federal offense?
Oh no??
Uh, yes?
He's a black kid that goes to my school?
I did?
No! I hate hippies!
No!
They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!
Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.
Hey you guys.
Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?
A what?
Wwhat's that?
I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here
Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
Well, okay... here... l'see...
Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.
Son of a bitch!
Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!
But you said-
I thought that-
You will?
Oh. Really?
Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
Romper?
You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!
What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
Sweet.
Hey, Romper Stomper.
Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
Phew!
Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
Yeah, me too.
That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
That was awesuhome!
Did you guys see that?
Whah!
I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!
What's going on?
No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
Hooray!
Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
Damn, we might be screwed.
Huh?
Yeah, you suck, dude!
Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!
Yeah!
Yeah, screw them!
I just gave you AIDS.
Huh?
Mr. Garrison??
You wanna be my friend?
That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
Dr. Mephesto, I need help.
Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
NAMBLA?
Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
Sure.
KIIICK ASS!
They're all over the place.
Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
Now, are you a team player or not?!
Well, Butters, there is no I in "team."
Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
Well, what?
Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
Huh?
Not with me, man.
But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
Thaaat's ri-ight.
Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
Yes I do!
The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
You won't let me help.
Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But, obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
Yeah.
Cool.
Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make "quadruple stuffs."
No way!
Huh.
Whoa.
Okay, It will be like this forever.
Me, too!
Boy band.
Boy band.
There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God!
So?
What?
Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
Kyle's brother?
Christ's sake..!
Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
Since when?!
...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
We're goin' to see the mall manager.
We... are Fingerbang!
We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
No??
Why not?!
You don't think we're any good, do you?!
What's the Gomlich effect?
So how do boy bands use that?
Thanks!
Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!" Okay?
Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
Roll camera!
Jesus Christ!
I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
Son of a bitch!
Really? You will?
That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
Aw, Mom!
Where the hell is Stan?!
Yes. Yes, sir, any secondwe're just waiting on one more member.
Oh, god-dammit!
Just another minute.
No! We were so close!
But we have to perform!
Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
Ok-Okay, okay.
No no, no. Separation.
A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
Jesus was made of crackers?
So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
Oh yeah, okay.
Right, I already got that one.
Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
No, you're already going to hell.
You are, too!
Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
What'd we do to Timmy?
Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.
Huh?
Who's in there?
Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
What?
Oh, now you've said it, too!
Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
And he never took Communion!
You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
Praise God-uh!
This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
Sister, have you read this book?
Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
Well...
Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
Praise the Lord-uh!
We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
He walks-uh!
Yes! Praise the Lord!
And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
You're gonna send me to hell?
There, that's better.
I'm trying.
You guys are all such pussies!
Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
You're damn right they do!
Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
Who the hell cares?!
God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!
Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
No way, lady!
You can suck my balls!
...What?
Touch, teacher. Touch.
What??
Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
Yeah, that's me.
Yeahhh, you already know about it?
Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
Okay, that's cool.
Ey!
Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
Why the hell not?!
Oh, cool.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
Hey, screw you.
Agh--! [four metallic arms from all directions reach out to trap him, then six more organic ones come in to secure him]
Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
Awww, man...
No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"
Cool! Can you get it for us?
I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
Yeh.
Whoa.
No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
Like what?
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
Oh, man!
No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
...Alright, fine! Get in costume!
What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
That's it?
I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
God, I have to everything around here!
Fat camp?
No.
Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!
What?!
Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
What?!
No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch."
Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!
Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.
Where is your husband?
Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!
Butters, calm down, alright?
Heh, heheh.
We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!
The Provider awakes!
Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.
Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
Heh-tchoo!
Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
Family?
Anything for more presents!
Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.
Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!
What?!
You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?
...deh..OOOWW!!!
Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!
What are you talkin' about, "quit"? Huh! I don't remember that.
Yeah, ham.
Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
You'll never guess.
Guess.
It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.
Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television!
Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?!
I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!
Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.
I don't get it.
Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
Yeah, he's excited.
Hey, yeah!
Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.
Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
Hehe, I don't sound like that.
Awww!
Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
Cripple fight!
Eh, we kick ass.
Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!
When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
Cool.
Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?
Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
He's going to eat his own head.
Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
No you're not.
No you're not.
No you're not.
No you're not.
Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
What?
I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.
Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
Hey, I was just about to do it.
Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
You wanna see 'em?
My pubes.
I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
Uh oo what?
Nuh uh!
You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
Just give me back my money...
Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
Whoa, bummer, dude.
Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
Well yeah, dude.
Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
I think this new guy's funny.
Aw, dude, gay!
Don't talk to us, kid.
Weak.
Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
Alright!
Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
Great. Now can we go?
Ogh! God-damnit..!
Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...
Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.
Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.
What?!
Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
Gentlemen, I thank you.
...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!
Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.
Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.
Ugh... Two people?
Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...
Sweet.
I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
The rest of you will just have to try another day.
Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.
But I don't know how it works.
Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!
I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
Just give me my money back.
I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
He-hey, that's my money!
What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!
But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!
This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!
I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
I told you guys.
AIDS?
Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!
Just put it on, Butters.
Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?
I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
Do you feel protected?
I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
So I don't get AIDS.
I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
Here, talk to them, Butters.
Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
Oh, bitch!
Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.
Let a man take a crap!
Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.
Why?
Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.
Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
Date-rape psychosis.
Awesome!
We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
That's... so... cool!
It's Monday?
Hey, towel!
No it isn't.
No it isn't.
Egh!
This is where you came from?
You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!
Yeah, and you're a towel!
We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
Could you turn it up?
Kenny!
Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
Hooray!
You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
...Not really.
Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.
Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?
HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
Yes, but they're sand monkeys!
...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.
Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?
Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!
Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!
Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!
I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.
Oh God.
You guys, something's wrong.
I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?
Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... [Mr. Mackey is shocked by the last one] This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
Ugh.
Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.
I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
Okay, let me have it.
Okay, why?
...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.
Who's there?
Orange who?
Who's there?
An interrupting cow who
Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.
And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
A-heh, what?
E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
What's that thing?
What?
Forty bucks?
Alright, alright.
Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
Ugh, ugh!
Oh!
Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
Goddamnit, give me another chance!
Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!
I'll make you eat your parents!
Aw, that is such bullcrap!
No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!
Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.
Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.
What in the hell are they doing?
Well, let's just play our game, then.
Uh huh.
Yeah.
Hey.
Ey, you did me already!
Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
Better.
Better.
Better.
Mint condition, tax free.
Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
Stem cells, numbnuts!
Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
Huho!
We sure are.
A- AIDS?
Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.
Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.
Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?
Shh-shh, here he comes.
Aww, sick dude!
Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nice.
They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?
Buh-ters! Buh-ters!
Uh oh, we're losin' him.
Oh, that was close.
The present.
Did he say "the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world"?
Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
What's the new topic?
Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!
Uh, sure!
Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and potpourri, and queazies.
Mmoooomm?
Could you do me a favor?
Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt golf course in the wwoooorrlldd?
I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?
Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.
Jeez, that girl is pissed off.
What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!
I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
Alriiight!
Where are we going?
What? Why?
So?
Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
I want out.
Yeah! Wait-what?
We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!
Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.
Can't go on. Need... food...
There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.
Food!
Look you guys! Beef jerky!
Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.
Hippies!
What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
Sure, sure.
What do you have in mind?
Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
Mike, speak.
We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?
Good, good.
Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.
And Worf?
Step back! Tell those men to step back!
No. See, you must say, "Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"
You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
Thank God we stopped it in time.
All right!
Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!
Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
Amen.
I'll do it.
Butters, could you take a seat, please?
Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.
Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
Lame, yes.
Yes, well, we weren't.
Who cares?
Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
Next?
Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.
Uh, what's the question again?
Five times one is of course...
Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!
All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?
Just one more rose, Kyle.
Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, "get the fudge out!" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
Next please.
If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?
You don't drink tea at a baseball game, you French piece of crap!
Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
I think Towelie is awesome.
Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.
Token's a smartass.
Yeah. Do we really need another one?
Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!
Tweek! Where are you going?
In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.
We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
Is it her?
No, just a bunch of goo.
G'night, guys.
You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to put them all in.
Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?
Do you have them or not?
What's your name?
No, gallons.
Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
Why can't societies just live in peace?
I don't know.
Ih... in our... butt?
Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
Hm.
Aw, dude, I think I might have it.
What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
Have you ever tried it?
I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!
I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.
O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!
Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!
Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
Well we can just make them out of paper.
It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
How many hats have you made?
They're gonna kick your ass, Tweek!
But just remember that I do all the talking.
Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
What could possibly go wrong?
Yeah, we're children.
Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!
Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!
Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
...No, he has an icy heart.
Oh, do we wanna do that?
Wow.
AY!
Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
That and youth. Those guys are old.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
It puts the lotion back in the basket!
Yes, mom?
Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?
Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
It just... It just seems like a really awesome shirt.
Yeah, may be.
Right, heh.
Woohoo.
God, you know what? That's so true. Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk.
And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
Pleeeeease???
Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?
Now you say, "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."
Heheh, yeah.
Now say it again, louder.
Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!
Now, just yell "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"
Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"
We're playing "Lambs."
Bebe's boobs?
So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
Dude, relax.
Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?
So weak. So weak, dude. Man.
At least I'm not a stupid Jew.
Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.
You bet your fat clown ass it is!
Wu-we don't really "need" the ticket stub, do we?
Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
You turned him into a teapot?
Wewewewewewe...
What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
How?
Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.
Jews can't be Paladins.
Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
Man, that's crap.
And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
This sounds like a really important quest.
This... is so cool.
And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
Yeah!
We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.
Clyde's a dick.
Quiet!
You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
It's Butters.
Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!
Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
If that was possible.
We're screwed.
The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
No, it was Kenny!
Ey!
Ey!
I'll take three lunches today, please.
Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!
Oh, about a month.
He's gone again.
Kenny!
Thanks, asshole.
Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!
Right now?
Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.
God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
It's still at baggage claim!
You're done?
Yeah, so how's it look?
But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
What?!
It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
Jesus Christ!
I'm just letting you guys know how special you are to me.
Oh my God, that's it!
The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
Really?
Wow!
Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
Wow, is that where Santa lives?
Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?
That's what I thought.
Hooray!
Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.
Oh, Christ.
Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!
Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-
Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!
I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
[resumes his position in back of the sleigh and speeds up his song] It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...
Jesus!
This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
Oh, God-damnit!
What?
Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
What?
What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
Eh... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.
No I don't remember that!
No, because the aliens erased my memory!
Aw dude, I hate repeats!
What?
Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Oww.
Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.
You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
Nope! It has to be Kyle!
All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
No, go ahead. I'm dry.
But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
Aw God, that movie pissed me off.
Santa!
No.
There's even World War Three to look forward to.
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
What is it, Chef?
We didn't go to your comedy show.
Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.
Can too!
Oh God-damnit!!
But they say I can't be in their club!!
You can't do that!
Like find out where Mrs. Streibel lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
Should be fine.
Yep. All set.
Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
Heh yeah, that that's right.
No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
So?
Who cares??
Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streibel probably had it comin' to her.
Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
Touch, Mr. Mackey, touch.
They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
Is there anything else I can get for you?
Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
Why not?
I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
And you feel like you have to confess.
I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
They did?
But can I still kill Kyyyle?
Uh, can we see them-him-her?
What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
So... so then, how can you feel bad?
...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!
It's over this way! Come on!
So how are things, guys?
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
My consciences just caught up with me.
I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
Hm.
But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
Maaaa. M-maaaa.
I'm trying to have a flashback.
Benjamin Franklin?
Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Founding Fathers!
I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
Oho yes! I did it I did it!
No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
It's a bitch, ain't it?
Wow.
Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
Wow!
If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too."
The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez.
Nono, Jeh-
Jeh-
Jeh
Jennifer Lopez.
Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?
Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?
Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
Is nice?
Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
I agree. Those places are stupid.
Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
Yeah, I wanna leave.
What?
What do they want?
S'awright?
What? What?
You want to sign Ms. Lopez?
There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to record an album next week.
Jennifer Lopez?
Not me!
I'm sure it was just a mistake.
Shut your God-damned mouth!
Nobody!
Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
I will!
Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.
What the hell are you doing?
Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!
Sleep!
Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!
NO!
I'm not going out in his car.
I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!
Aww crap.
OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
What news?
S'aright.
Oh, balls!
I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
Stop doing what?
Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
My God...
What have you got, Marsh?
And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington.
Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.
No sign of forced entry.
We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room.
Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.
Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!
You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
Stop playing games!
I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
Really?
Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
Well pull harder!
Try doin' it faster.
Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
Why not?
Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
Yeah! This was our hot lead!
Dammit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
We got her back safe. Lost a lot of good men in the process.
Kewl!
Uh bonus?
Me neither.
We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
Well, keep tryin', Butters.
Uh oh...
You did?
Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
Man, Indians have it good, huh?
I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!
Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
That's right!
Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
What? Tell us?
We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
You're straight like a freeway!
You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
...So? I'm half bisexual!
I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
I told you, Token.
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
Almost there, you guys.
No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
Old people!
They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
More old people!
Old people gone mad!
Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
You have AIDS?
You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
I have never been a dick to you.
Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
What isn't it?
...I don't understand the difference.
Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people?
Like what?
Who's there?
Hey Kyle.
Well what?
I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
Good.
For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
Yes?
Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
What what what?
The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
Happy Birthday to you. Happy- [looks at the other boys for support]
But... Casa Bonita.
Yeah. Somebody needs to put him in him place!
Go kick his ass, Stan.
Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
Right. What are we playing again?
What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
Yeh-heah, right!
God, what a fag!
Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmas time.
I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
What?
You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
Sweet.
Look out!
Oh Jesus Christ.
Which road?!
But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
How much further to Ottawa?! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.
It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!
Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.
Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
Ugh.
Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
I have the power to have all the powers I want.
Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
Oh, shit, dude!
Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
Dr. Shafley?
So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
No way, you got weapons too?!
Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
Butters!
We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
Here, Butters!
Butter- Butters!
Here, Butters!
Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
What?
Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
What? What'd I do?
It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
Why?
Moooommmm?
Um, could I get you to do something for me?
I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
Awesome.
Naaaa!
Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
Enter. [Kyle enters, and walks up next to Cartman]
Go on, Kyle.
Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Jew.
Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
One thousand dollars, yeah!
Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
God-damnit!
Ah, screw you hippies!
What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
Set phasers on stun.
Yes. A little too quiet.
Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
Go see the movie, Kyle!
You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
Mom! Doorbell!
It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
What?
You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
Es ist Zeit fr Rache!
Es ist Zeit fr Rache!
Nice.
Es ist Zeit fr Rache!
Es ist Zeit fr Rache!
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
Yeah!
All right!
All right, Butters!
I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
Yes. I will be your new best friend.
Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
Oh, really?
Heh. Wow, that sucks.
Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
What?
You saw that?
Nuh uh.
No way.
Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
No.
Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now.
Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
Choo-choo train! Yay!
Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
...Train together
I've got time. Do youuu??
Choo-choo train.
Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
Deeper.
Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
Dude, I'm takin' a break.
Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
Shoveling accident.
You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
What?! Who?!
Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
Ye-heah!
Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich."
It is not!
Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
A turd sandwich.
Turd sandwich.
Turd sandwich.
Awwwww!
Okay. You win, Kyle.
All right turd sandwich!
Giant Douche sucks!
Game on, Jew-boy!
We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?
Oh, no! Noooo!!
You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
Whoa, awesome!
Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
What? That's called progress, Kyle.
You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
Nuh-uh.
I am not, Kyle!
You heard what?
Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
You speak too much, sir!
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
Oh, Holy Jesus, God...
It's true.
He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
Don't worry, Trent.
Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
Whatever. That's like five years from now.
Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my ass cheeks.
Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.
Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
All right!
You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
A picture of your mom's boobs?
A lot of stupid things that we regret.
Aaaaaaaah!
Stay away from us, Trent!
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
Whatever, that's like five years from now.
Uh oh.
Hah! Hey!
And I'm Rick Cartman.
Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
How many students is that?
What is that butthole doing now?!
Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
...You're gay!
Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
Go play with yourself, Craig.
Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?
This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
I'm gonna!
Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
Wheh? Where am I?
Coma... How long?
Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!
Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
How come the outline is missing its hand?
Guess again.
Wow!
Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
What?
I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
No. Nothing.
More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
Proper channels?
I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
In court?
... 'Kay. Sweet.
Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!
I don't even know you dude!
Oh, Jesus.
No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
AAAAAAAH!
(Hey! Come over here!)
No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
You can't hurt me.
Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
That's not at all what happens.
This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.
Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!
You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.
Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
Yeah!
Oh, son of a bitch!
No, Chef has always been super-cool.
So what can we do??
Come on, bitch! Dance!
Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!
It's ok Chef, Go on, remember!
Look, If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!
Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
Run Chef!
A grizzly bear!
Oh never mind.
Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
Dude, what are you doing?
THAT's gay, heh.
Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!
Who?
I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
Yich.
Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.
That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.
What?
You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
You know we might not even make it into the studio.
So what made you change your mind?
Well Kyle, we'd better get going.
Are you set?
Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
Kyle, stop it!
Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!
I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
Kyle, stop it!
So long, Kyle!
Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.
Dude, can I go before you?
So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
Seeya.
Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
Why not?
Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
How the hell did you get out?
Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
Stop it!
Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!
Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
No! Think about the people who could get hurt!
Shut up, Kyle!
Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!
No gay speeches, Kyle!
Dude, what are you doing?
No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
You... have that kind of power?
Somebody get us some help down hyah!
Hello??
You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
Grab my hand.
I can't kick!
I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!
I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
Well he called me chubby!
Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!
Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!
Mom, I want a Twinkie.
The hell do you think you're doing?
Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!
Time out?
Ummm, no?
All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
[hooks up the X-Box again] Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
Because you took my Xbox.
Well, yeah.
Yeah. I guess so.
Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
Why not?
You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
Not interested in me?
Yeah, well I don't see why-
Hey!
Mom, this guy doesn't-
Ah! Quit it!
Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
KNOCK IT OFF!
I'm not fat!
Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
Mom, this is degrading!
Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!
Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
Mom!
This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
Quit it, mom!
Ooo, Colonel?
Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.
Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!
Suck my asshole, taco vendor!
You can't do that to me, I-
Goddamnit, you just can't-
Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
...Should that really matter at a time like this?
This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
All right, I'm back.
Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
Aw, Goddammit!
What is he still doing here?!
What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-
Seriously! Mom-
Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?
Mom?!
Mom? Mom...
Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.
She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.
Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.
She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham.
Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.
Tha... thank you?
No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
Okay, I'm back.
Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
Heheh, totally, heheh.
Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.
Get out of here, asshole!
That sonofabitch!
He's a God damned butthole!
My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?
Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!
Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.
The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
Butters? What the hell are you doing?
You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
Aha! Do you see?
I rest my case.
That's right, Butters.
What? People see the truth?
And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, "Do you smell lemon grass?", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!
Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!
Aw Goddamnit!
The hall monit- me?
Ahem. Me?
Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?
Here, you need a smoke, brah?
You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.
What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
They what??
Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!
You got a hall pass, brah?!
Get down on the floor!
...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.
I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!
Oh no!
I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!
Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
Freeze, bitch!
Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!
What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
I've done it lots of times.
I am not!
Dude...
You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
How do you know??
How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!
Noo!! Nooo!!
How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
Oh God!
Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.
I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
It's simple science, Kyle.
I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!
Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.
You're gonna help me freeze myself.
No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.
Where am I?
Safe where, butthole?!
Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!
I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
Who are they??
Jesus Christ!
I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
What??
Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.
Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
I got it! I got the Wii!
Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!
There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!
Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.
Tell me about it.
Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
I care! Where's the closest toy store??
Come on! Come on!
Ugh, finally!
I want one of those time-phone things.
Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.
Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
Look, I have to have one of those phones!
How about a robot? How much for the robot?
I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.
Who is this?
What?? Who the hell is this?!
Me who?!
What?!
Oh very funny, Kyle!
Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.
Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!
Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!
Suck my balls!
...Okay, you have one minute.
This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
What is the Great Question?
I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
Who?
Garrison? But he's an asshole.
It's an emergency! It's an emergency!
I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!
Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?
So there is no war now in the future.
I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.
Mom! Mom, they did it!
Hello?
Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
Ohhhhhhhh?
Look, look how its face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed it up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
It's a midget, dude.
Say "Uncle!"
Hahaha, now say "Carol Anne, don't go into the light!"
Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
Kyyyle!
What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
Because that makes Butters gay now!
Eh- ...what?
Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
How?
Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
You ready?
Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
Right, except for you.
...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski.
It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
All right. It's a picture ...of me.
No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep.
I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
You, you will?
Mom, she's lying!
Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
Me?!
I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
Kenny!
What, Clyde?
Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
Get online. I need you to check something for me.
Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
Get online now!
He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
I said I will only talk to the President!
LALALALALALALALA!
LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
Yes, Mr. Thompson?
Why? Did you find something?
Big surprise!
Let me have time with him.
You can make it stop!
Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
Where is your son?!
Butters.
We got him! I know where he is!
You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
Uhh yes, of course?
The Russians?
The Germans?
The Germans again?
You can't possible mean...?
Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
Yes or no, Kyle?!
And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
Have you lost your mind?
You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
Que paso? Que paso? Looking for work? S? Trabajo?
Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.
Okay, gracias.
Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
All right, did you write the four essays?
Okay, let's have 'em.
Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
There's a bunch outside my house too.
Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
You what?!
You see what you did, Kyle?!
They're everywhere!
Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
Cool.
Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
Youu heard about that?
Thirty was hard enough.
Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.
What's your problem, kid?!
What?
Puh- pussy!
...Cocksucker!
Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!
Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
Dicktits!
Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
Kyle please! I'm sorry!
Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
No! Goddammit no!
Kyle?
Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
...What?
Where are you going?!
Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
Kyle?
No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
Real guitars are for old people.
Oh my God this is so awesome.
All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
What?
Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
No, because chicks know I'm not fat, I'm buff! They probably put you at the bottom of the list 'cause you have fucked-up teeth! Or Kenny 'cause he's poor.
Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him?
Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can out think them.
Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time". When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
AHHHHHH.
What?
No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
...Ice cream?
All right, so where's my ice cream?
You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
What's that supposed to mean?!
I HAVE AIDS?
Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
God damn it, this sucks ass!
Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
So this is it?
Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
Just bring out Elton John already!
Jimmy Buffett?!
Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!
Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.
Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
No you don't!
Ironic how?
Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
Kyle, what?!
Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
Nothing!
Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
Kyle!
Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
He was a basketball player.
We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
Kyle, we need to try to find a-
Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
All right!
Yeah, but we totally don't.
Aw dude, that's our town!
That's enough to buy slaves!
Okay, ready Kenny?
Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
Oh God, I'm bored already.
We don't care. *urp*
God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
There's more people viewing it!
Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
Good. Again.
Again!
Now you sound like white people!
The answer to #27 is 5.
The answer to #28 is 14.
Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
Uh what?
Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
Let's be partners, Kenny.
God damn it!
That isn't necessary!
You can let go now, Butters.
Butters, come on!
I wanna shoot an Indian.
Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
Fine, then let go of my hand!
Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
Fine, then you're comin' with me!
Butters, let go God-damn it!
Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
Yeheah, we're wired up!
Aw, just a few more things.
Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
They must have realized we left. Damn.
Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
Butters?
Save me!
... Oh dude, laaame.
Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
Butters.
Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
Butters, I need your help.
The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
Ting ton teetong.
All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
Oh my God...
Hold the gun on them Butters!
They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
Shoot him, Butters!
You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
Dude...
I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?
Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
You're gonna fight me after school?
You're a chick, dude.
She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
Eat my underwear?
No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.
You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
What?! That's ridiculous!
That's not why I did it.
Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
Told you guys.
What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey
Butters, get out of here!
Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
That's not true. You're just saying that.
You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
What girl is gonna see your balls?
Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
Shut up already!
So?
How much?
Really? Are you sure?
Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
Craig, don't be an asshole.
No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
No! No es bueno! [grabs the siku and throws it away. The band stops playing. The siku player looks at his empty hands and goes after the siku]
No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!
And we're white.
There's no talking to this guy.
You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
That's right.
What is it?
Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
Dude, it's Craig!
Yeah, it's coming from up there.
Dude, that's awesome.
Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
That guy's an asshole!
There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
Oh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
All right Butters, well you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
Yeah, now get out of here.
Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
Yes.
Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
Well well well, here he comes. It's B.J. McKay and his best friend Bear.
Purity ring?
Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
The hell did you do to us?!
And knowing is half the battle.
He's not a fag!
I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
Fuckin' butthole!
You gotta be kidding me!
What?! Why?
It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
What?
What the fuck is this?!
Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
Yes, that's good.
Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.
Sick! Stop it, lady!
It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
Yeah, I like fishsticks.
What, dude, you got something?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?
Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
What are you?
And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!
What?!
Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?
Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
You do?
Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?
So then I can say, "What are you, a gay fish?"
Thanks you guys!
Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.
Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
Yeah, that was kewl huh?
Whassat?
So... here it is.
Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!
Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
Hello Jim.
Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!
But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.
Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!
We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?
We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!
That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
What?!
You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with.
Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.
This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!
Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.
Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!
Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!
The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!
Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!
I said, get off my boat!
Hard to port, lads!
'Sup, Jew?
HA! What a dumbass!
Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
Because he was a great person, Kyle.
...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...
Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.
Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!
Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
Yes!
A child... and a female. And white.
Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
God I hope this works.
Hey, what the F?!
Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
What if you didn't have to give it up?
I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.
Yeah!
Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.
Alright, your turn Craig.
Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
Atta boy Butters!
Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
Dude, we've created a monster.
Oh my God, dude, this is sooo awesome!
This is awesome!
Dude! That was so badass!
The fuck is this?!
All right!
The Rad Russian.
You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
Huh?
Okay...
The fuck is this?!
That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say "You slept with my girlfriend," and I'll charge you into a head slap.
Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like "No no, the fight hasn't started yet," and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
Noo, let's save the "girlfriend is a whore" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.
We just received a letter from the WWE.
"Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling organization and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."
Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.
Right?
No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.
Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
Yeah, this guy crushes.
My man can do whatever he wants.
You're just gonna have to deal with that.
My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!
Kenny! I'm-
What do you mean? This song is sweet.
I'm not too busy, Stan.
No, I just don't care. At all.
What dude?
We always have.
That's not what we said.
We were talking about Wales the country.
Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
What dude?
So that's what this has all been about?
Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
Agreed.
Ni-nice, okay.
What?
I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
That was us!
Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?
Oh, they think we meant gay fags.
Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
You call them "bike-curious".
Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
Emmanuel Lewis, huh?
No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
Oh. My. Goodddd.
Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
Mr. Mackey, what's a moronic jizzrag?
But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
"Thank you" and this is to..?
Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
That'll be five dollars.
A book signing.
I do not directly say she's a slut!
"Or does she?" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
Of course. That's why we're here.
Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?
What? What do you mean I know that?
No! You wiped them all out!
Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
You sold the movie rights to who?!
Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
Huh!
No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
Come on, let's go!
Just do it in English!
I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? And there are a hundred and ninety black people!
So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
...What do you mean?
The black and brown people.
Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's a fifty percent rise in one, year!
Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
Help! Help!
Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
Well, I do just as much work.
Noooo...
Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
Oh dude, was that a combo move?
Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
I told you this game was sweet, dude.
Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
Oh, you're going down, Elin!
Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
Oh really? Sweet.
Oho man, I can't wait!
No on, come on, let's read it now!
Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
We know, we were just saying that.
It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
Butters, what are you up to?
Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
That's right.
Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
That inconsiderate jerk!
There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
See any hunters yet?
Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
So what?
People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
What?!
Oh come on!
Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
Mom, drive faster!
Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
Fuck you!
No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
Yeah. Who isn't?
Billy Miller? Seriously??
Tommy said you have some KFC.
How much KFC are we talking?
Holy fuck, dude.
Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
Are you Teabag?
Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
Nothin', it's cool.
Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.
Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
Good.
...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
Colonel, how are you doing?
We had a little problem.
Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
Hey, take it easy Colonel.
I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy.
You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
Okay let's, let's try this one.
This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
Yeah, so what?
So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
You just had seven tacos.
Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
I tried getting one last week!
God, will somebody shut her up?
Let me by...
My father...
I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
How could you know anything about who my family is?
If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
I said GET. Mr. Hat!
Keep... your hand... UP!
By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
Nice work, Conner.
Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
Them who?!
Then start explaining it to me!
No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
It's all that matters!
I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
Who you calling stupid, Jew?
Gingers? No!
Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
Daddy?
Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
What do you know?!
Mom?
Protect who??
My dad was a Denver Bronco?
No- nooo.
No! Noooo!
Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
My dad was a ginger!
I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
What?
Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
You love NASCAR huh?
Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
Butters.
Get really psyched up, Butters!
I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
Not yet.
Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!
Fucking gross!
"Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes."
Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
What's that?
All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
Aw donkey balls...
Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I've had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
Yeah?
...Uh oh.
Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
He's fuckin' gay as hell!
Alright, "start your engine." What's that mean?
Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck mah car.
Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
Aw, crap, there's more of them?
You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
What the hell are you guys doing?!
Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open.
Come on, you guys, hurry!
I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
What does it want?!
No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
I need to speak with him, please.
I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! [Craig looks off into the distance, surprised]
No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
Toshiba Handibook??
Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
Yes! She fucks me so hard!
Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
At Best Buy.
Uh huh.
Yes!
No!
Booooooo!
She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
What?! Hey, that's mine!
What's this?
My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
Go look for yourselves!!
There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
What, Kyle?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
Oh, Goddamnit!
Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!
For what?!
Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
What?
Those weren't our dick sizes?
I don't know! Why would you?!
Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
Fuck you! No I don't!
Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
Why the fuck am I here?!
Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
Oh, that's cool.
My penis is 13 inches long.
Yeah dude!
The Jews!
No, and fuck Kyle!
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
Wait, what?
Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
I'm still fucking angry!
Oh. Hey Kyle.
I'm volunteering.
Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
Betsy MacIntosh?
We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?
Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.
I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-
It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
They can't make money. It's against the rules.
Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
We're a non-profit company, Kyle.
Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- "student atheletes" then?
I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?
How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!
How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
...What?
Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!
What?
Vunter Slash?
But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?
But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?
You knew about this??
I just can't believe Slash isn't real,
I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.
Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
Yaaaay!
Stan's getting another present, Mom.
Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
Turn it off dude!
Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
He's lying, dude. Hit X
What's that?
Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
Look like ice cream to me.
Oh cool, the movie trailers!
That looks pretty good.
Stan, knock it off!
No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
Yep!
Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
Wait what?
Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
That's right, it's a butt fungus.
Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
A what??
What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
Really?
Gee, thanks Kyle!
Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
Nice!
It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
Everything alright here, Kyle?
We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
I'm not pouting! I've just heard all these jokes before!
Where is Butters?
You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
Oh dude. Sweet.
This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
Wait a minute, isn't that...
Ey!
I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!
Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, "Poopypants Pete", but th- but then I also thought of "Mushpants Melman."
Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
Hey! Whoooa.
'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?
Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
WAY worse!
Alright, kewl.
Nobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
Yeah, I think they're all ready.
It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
No thanks. Okay, proceed.
That. Was. Amazing.
Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
What do you mean, Peter Panda?
Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
Mom, have you been here all day?!
Am I sure?? Look at this place!
Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
Fly bu-what?
Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?
Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
What?! Who?!
Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
Oh sure!
Who did this to you?!
Don't worry, I'll get you down!
Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
They were your FRIENDS!
Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
Uh-huh??
Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
Oh no. Oh NO!
You guys have stuffing?!
No!
NO!
Yeah, History Channel rules.
Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
Eh yeah?
What?
Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
Yeah, see, the problem, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kid in skewl!
Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
That's right.
Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
How?!
Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
You're my new mom?
Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
Really?
I wasn't making fun of anybody.
I was just teasing.
Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking something topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
I'm not saying it.
I'm not saying it!
Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."
I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
Nuh-uh.
Who are these buttholes?
Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
That's right.
Yeah.
That's right.
Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
Oh boy, here we go.
So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot.
Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
Nice bolo tie, Stan.
No, dude, it's... badass.
...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
Dialog
Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought "Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"
Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.
Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.
And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.
How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
Oh, please. Bradying is so 2000 and late.
Well, there is the nice French caf downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
Yes!
What's it say, what's it say?
Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
Dude, what's going on?
Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
It's okay, man, come on.
No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
No, kitty, you have to be quiet.
Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
SHUT UP, KITTY!
Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
Oh, hey, Kyle.
Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
JESUS IS A LIE!
Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
Sh! You hear that?
It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
Why?
Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
Wingstreet?!
HUH?!
Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
This isn't safe or fun!
NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
What does that mean?
Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?
But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
I love you, dad.
He has a point.
I have balls.
Still balls.
The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
Ziplining. Hell yeah.
Alright!
...No.
Finally!
Mmmm, no?
The trees' biology?
Yeah.
Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
NOOOO!
We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"
I brought it up because you already brought it up!
Fuck you Kyle!
Nnnn-mo...
If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
A marina?
Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
You?!
You came for us!
What?
Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
...Token. You want me to pass her a jelly bean?
Huh?
Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
Thanks, you guys.
Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
Kyle, Jesus Christ!
Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
Oh did they? I hadn't heard about that.
Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
Nothing.
Nobody.
Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
No, they won't!
No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
And you! I should have never believed in you!
Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
Denver Nuggets game?
Nooooooo!
No time! NOOOOOOO!
That's right, Butters.
That's true.
Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
Hey Butters, you got a minute?
I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
...I don't have a dad.
Youuu save it all?
Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
I'm pissed!
Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
I ain't done with you, bitch!
Dude, no way!
Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
Oh no, really?
Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
What-what do you mean?
Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
Sorry about this.
'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean "That's all right"! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
Heh- hello?
No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
No, "uloveboobs." Lower-case u love boobs.
My password is uloveboobs!
You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
FELLAS! Fellas!
You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
...Wow.
Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
The Incredible...
No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
That's right!
Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
Uh huh.
The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
Craig?! You asshole!
Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
MOM!
She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
Mom? Where's my mom?
Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
What if I did, Kyle?
Pretty sweet, huh?
What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
Mm, mhm, mhm.
They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
I want a part in the new movies!
I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
Haha.
Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like "Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"
Yeah, but I was like "I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle." In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
Who is that? Is that Toby
Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
You're what? What, you say?
That'd be what?
Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?
Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
What, they already have something better than Twitter?
No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
["Alright, what's up everybody, what's up? I'm about ready to go to the NSA undercover, and see if I can expose some of those secrets." When Cartman appears, Kyle stops. "You can follow me on my Shitter account at #keepyourgovernmentoutofmybusinessdotcom. Wait, sh, I've gotta be careful. Kyle is here and I'm pretty sure he's tryin' to listen in."]
[walks up to Kyle. "Kyle, if you wouldn't mind, this broadcast is for my Shitter followers only." Clyde and Stan join them]
[leans towards Clyde. "Don't know if you've heard, but the government is actually able to monitor all our e-mails and Twitter accounts." leans towards Clyde. "With Shitter I don't even need a cell phone. My thoughts are sent directly to the Internet, and then to everyone else on Shitter."]
[leans towards Stan. "Yes. Now as I infiltrate the NSA, I'll be able to broadcast everything to all my Shitter followers."]
Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.
Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
["Oh cute. I'll have to try it out sometime, lol."]
["Wow, that's kewl. She's cute.;) emoji"]
Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
Bill Clinton.
Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
["Four sixteen pm. The chief asked me to join him as he went to question the possible suspects. I agreed to go along. Hopefully, the NSA has no idea of my secret intentions." The chief looks at him. "lol." The chief focuses on the road again. Moments later they stop in front of a house and get out of the car. The chief knocks on the door and a hippie answers it.]
["I've done it. I've infiltrated the NSA, and gained their trust." A shot of Alec Baldwin and his date at a buffet restaurant. The camera pans across until it reaches the couple. "So far, I've not ascertained how they were able to keep track of everyone in the country, but I'm close. Very close. I just hope that I'm not found out as a whistleblower before I'm able to expose their entire operation."]
Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
Really? How big is my file?
Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
I don't know.
["Your secret is out, NSA! And now that everyone knows what you're doing to Santa you can kiss your program goodbye!"]
You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
I do toooo!
...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?
What's this?
I can be forgiven?
For everything bad I've ever done?
And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
I do, I love my country!
I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.
I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
That's more like it.
Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?
You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.
Alright, we've gotta do something.
Something he said. Did you hear him? He said "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"
You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
M'kay.
No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!
Hey Token? How are you doing?
No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!
Agreed.
Hoh boy, here we go.
This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
Token, calm down.
Get to an airport!
The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
Everyone quiet! I have to think!
Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
His name is Token.
I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
That sucks, dude.
I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
What? What joke? This is real!
Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
You what??
Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
Small penis?!
No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.
Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
What do you mean?
Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
That's right.
We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
What new Elmo doll?
Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
The men are just inexperienced, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick.
Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
So what happens when the dragons show up?
Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
Why don't you mind your own business?!
Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
That could be up to you.
Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
Yeah!
Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
Hi, is Kenny home?
I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.
Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
That doesn't even make sense.
Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
Your CEOs?
Uhhh, hmmm. What?
Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
Because, because what? Because he's cute?
But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!
So what are you saying, Kyle?!
Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
Dude! Dude!
Dude, shut the fuck up!
He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
God damn it, shut up!
I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?
Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyonc.
Yesh, kewl.
Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
Yes, he did.
What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
What the hell is this?!
Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
They're not a part of your betrayal?
Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
We'd like to get XBox Ones please.
The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.
Protruding vaginal boner.
Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
It's sooo sweet!
It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
I told you guys! "Washington Redskins" totally gets people's attention!
Sittin' on our asses, here we come!
Yes, I know.
Oh, cool. Please take a seat.
Nice, I like that.
Stop? But why?
How is it offensive?
Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
Well that's fine! You can't call yourself "Washington Redskins!"
Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
Goooood morning, guys!
We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
What?!
You song of a bitch!
You broke Kickstarter!
Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
Well, somebody did!
Whoa, whoa! What?
How's it going, everybody?
What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
Dude, people are pissed off at us.
Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...
What?
We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
So who do we throw the party for?
You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
"I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."
Believe it, dude.
What the hell is gluten?
KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
KYYYLE!
What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.
I don't even know what that means.
Are you going to eat those pancakes?
Oooo, trippy...
KYYYLE!
KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!
My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
What, what is it? What is it for?
It's upside down.
Sir, the pyramid is upside down.
Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
I'm going to the potty.
Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.
Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girl's shitter.
Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.
That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
Erica.
All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.
There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. [poops and farts]
Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
OH MY GOD!!!
Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.
Oh on that side?
Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
DUDE, THIS IS MY FUCKING BATHROOM!
I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!
Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT A CHICK WATCHING ME GO POO!
HEY, WHAT THE FUCK DUDE?! GOD FUCKING DAMN IT!
Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
No it isn't.
That's stupid.
I'm dying of boredom.
Your dad has a fucking drone?
Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
Butters, is that you?
Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
This thing is recording, right?
His dad sees you!
Fly back to the house, stupid!
Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
Not a word, Kenny!
Hey you guys.
You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.
Butters-
Butters. Butters.
Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
What does that have to do with me?
Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
You were what?!
You were spying on me?!
But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
Butters.
Because, Butters-
Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one."
Oh hey Butters. Sup?
Dude, what's the matter?
Butters.
Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
Your dad's drone.
Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
Yes.
The?!
Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
That makes sense.
Cool.
What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
Welcome back, dude.
How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
Thank you, Kyle.
Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
Wait, hang on Butters!
Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
Are you okay?
Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
Butters.
With what?
Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.
Are you fucking with me?!
Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
Because if you are, it's not cool!
Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
That's right!
THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
Okay Kyle.
Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
Calm down.
In virtual reality, yes you did.
You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
Or if I did?
Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
Because... I'm a computer program.
I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
This asshole needs to make a move already!
He's playing an enchantment.
Dude, it was complete brutality!
At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
Dude, do we look like police?
Dude, that was total carnage!
Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
We're going again on Friday, right?
What's the matter Kenny?
You feel bad for the roosters?
Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
Huh? A little bit?
Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play "Magic: The Gathering"?
Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh, Kenny?
What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?
All right, McNuggets!
Thank you so very much.
You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
Who is that??
Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
McNuggets is scared, dude!
This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an Overseer.
Ah, dude, your dad's here.
It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.
CartmaaanBrah!
Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.
CartmaaanBrah!
CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
What the hell did I do?
Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
Sweet dude!
I've already got four days of detention. I don't want anymore. I'm gonna start following the rules.
Deny and subvert.
Everybody shoplifts. Why are you coming down on me?
A perfect storm of hypocrisy that everyone in the country has to deal with for months on end.
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say "You're not giving me four day of detention! You're only giving me one!"
Oh, PC Principal, how are you today?
You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I'm not going to accept four days of detention and... you're going t'apologize publicly for being so strict to me and my friends at school.
You mean about keeping your dick out?
Oh-kay. Look, you don't want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so you?
Oh God!
There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admit I did something wrong, take my punishment, and move on. I'm not Tom Brady.
No way.
Because PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it's time for us to grow up.
If I can face my prejudice, why can't you? We're two privileged, straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with.
No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let's start a new chapter.
No. I'm going to call you... my friend.
I... guess we never realized how bad he really was.
Ack! Butters!
Oh Butters, I've lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS?
I'm never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman.
Who?
I don't have a choice. I have to take these PC people out.
You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy.
Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in?
And he's sitting right here.
Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now.
But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew.
Yeah, I'm out.
Because apparently he doesn't care that his jokes are at the expense of actual people.
I'm not a joke!
I wanted someone smart and hard-working!
There you are. You have my social media comments?
Butters!
Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed!
Butters, I want this fixed by tonight, you got that!
Uh oh.
I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude?
I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along.
Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you.
Did you do it, Cupid-Me?
Yeah, dude. You're hilarious.
Yep. School tomorrow should be really interesting.
Someone who needs a real talking to.
Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing.
You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys.
No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now.
Fuck you.
The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help.
Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together.
It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me.
Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight!
Kenny and Token.
Kenny and Token, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me.
No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away.
It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!
That's pretty cool.
Totally dude, ninjas are sweet.
Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters.
I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things.
Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool.
Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad!
Oh my God! I never said it was gay!
So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember?
And we said Kenny and Token were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember?
No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Butters.
Whoa, dude.
They're fuckin' ninjas, dude!
Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something?
...and I am Token. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage.
Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, but Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle.
No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please!
I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin' gay but you didn't wanna listen, nooo!
[yawns and whispers to Kyle] Oh, my fucking God...
I'm so bored, dude.
I am not your slave, Kyle.
[laughs] PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle!
Have fun, dude.
Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out?
How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties.
How does it do that?
That movie's gonna suck dude.
Eating ice cream, dipshit.
And then Token tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead. [the boys burst out laughing again]
Didn't we finish doing that?
Why isn't anyone looking at me?
Stan's calling you a traitor.
I am loving this right now.
Hoh that's low. [smiles]
Fight! [the kids gather round to watch. Half of them are cheering them on, the other half stay quiet. Nathan stops by to see what's going on.]
What?
Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda?
So what do we do now?
Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns?
Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what?
Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner. [Kyle smiles and walks off. Cartman poses with his gun] Do I look sweet, Butters?
It's "Skankhunt42" and no I am not.
Unfortunately, that'd be a breach of my civil rights, but I can assure you, nobody respected you girls' poignant protest more than I did.
Hey, girls are funny, Wendy. Okay? Get over it. Just do women's comedy stuff. You know, talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with guy and then say "my vagina" a lot..
K, that wasn't really funny, it was just angry.
K, that's good, now just try to say it a little funnier now.
Okay, and then, and then, and then just go, "my vagina."
Rebooting fairy tales to try and ease the friction caused by Internet trolls.
Why would I do that, Kyle?
Yeah, no, they do! Vaginas totally have balls! Right?
What do you mean? If vaginas don't have balls, what do they have?
You were right, Kyle. Okay? I drew the vagina on my face. I tried to fool people, but you keenly noticed my one tiny error in that girls don't have balls.
Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing. I know that a war is coming between us and the girls. I knew it the moment they sat out the National Anthem.
Suppose for one second that I'm not Skankhunt42. And that I really have been doing what I've been doing to try and stop the damage he has done?
'Cause I'm scared, Kyle. I don't know if you've noticed, but race wars are back. And now if we get gender wars too??
'Sup dudes?
Bros!! Dude, that's so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever!
I'm totally gonna do some massive pwnage. Whoever's on my team will be stoked. My laptop's so fast it doesn't lag at all. I can jump around like a pwnage powerhouse.
You guys all seem kinda, like, bummed out. Is everything cool?
This place has sweet wifi, right? Gon' be so awesome.
Dude, is this where we're gonna play? I call dibs on this side! What's the wifi called? Is there a password?
What are you...What are you guys talking about - What-
Oh my God. Oh my God, you guys are gonna break all my stuff so I can't get online!
Please! Please don't break my stuff you guys! This is like, 2 Christmases and a birthday worth of stuff! You guys can't do this! Please!
No, don't-get-it-over-with! Don't break my stuff! I'm not SkankHunt, I'm not! You guys, you guys, you don't have to do this! You-don't-have-to-do-this! We can still just play Counter-Strike, and forget everything! Oh-my-God, there's no wifi - We can use my phone, to make a hotspot and we can still play Counter-Strike! And it'll be sweet! You guys, come on, please! Please, you can't!
Please, Clyde! Clyde, you're my friend! Please, y-you know how much - I - need - my - stuff!
No, God! No! Don't! Don't!! Don't!! Oh my God!!
Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Aahh!! Niah!! Niaah!! Iaahh!! Iaahh!! Niaaahhhh!!!
Heidi? Heidi Turner?
Where? [she turns and walks off to her left]
The park?
[begins to cry] I miss my stuff.
For what?
You weren't the only one. I guess I didn't deserve a second chance. I really tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show that I was trying to listen.
[earnestly] Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fuckin' mind.
I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did.
Kewl.
Hey. [long pause] I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny.
Because, black laughs matter.
Yes, it is.
Yes, you do. [Heidi just looks downward] Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world?
You wanna go somewhere? I'll follow you. [Heidi smiles]
Yeah. It's the best, dude. Try it.
Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something?
Do girls... not have balls?
So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work? [she wonders why he's asking] I just don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina.
...Holy shiiit.
[looks at Kyle] Hey, Kyle.
Cool. That's cool.
I saw a vagina, Kyle.
I'm not holding a grudge. I'm happier now. I have purpose.
My girlfriend's. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast. But in that instant, you know what I saw? I saw that humankind can colonize Mars. I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and reach the infinite.
[stands up and talks to Heidi] Of course you did 'cause you're amazing. Look at what I made you.
That's what my baby wanted.
[puts the necklace on Heidi and faces Kyle] Oh sorry. Heidi, you know Kyle?
Oh either way, we totally can. I, I guess Kyle has something to talk to us something about first, um. [talks to Kyle] Go ahead, Kyle.
He said something about us working together to take down Butters.
I'm not sure, Boo. [faces Kyle] Could you start from the beginning, Kyle? [faces Heidi] Heidi is amazing at figuring stuff out.
[talks to Kyle] You want to know what's really going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Even though women have made great gains in the last century, there are still a part of men who aren't comfortable with women having power. It really just comes down to that, and then you have social media which allows men to anonymously say horrific things like "Women aren't funny," even though Heidi's like the funniest person I'be ever met.
[talks to Heidi] No, it's true. Get over yourself.
I know. You don't have to 'cause you're awesome.
[talks to Kyle] Like mess with Butters how? [lifts mug] What do you mean "mess with Butters"? [drinks from mug]
[gets mad] Oh I see! You have a problem with Heidi.
You're threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say and she is funnier than you.
[talks sarcastically] Oh she's not funnier than you, [speaks with anger] or is she just not funny because she's a girl?
[talks to Heidi] Sorry, babe. It just really ruffles my feathers.
[talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, we're just out of it now.
Humans on Mars.
[walks from the girls side of the fight to the in between Nelly and Butters and spreads his arms] Hey hey hey! Whoa, guys! Guys! [crowd stops yelling] Hasn't this gone on long enough? Aren't we tired of being so divided at skewl?
It's cool, Baby.
Heidi has been really hurt by all of this, you guys. And I think it's time for us to all try to come together, as a skewl.
Hey you guys?
Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny.
You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby.
Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember?
Remember, you were like "Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?" in uh, what was it? [they hold hands] Remember, you- it was like uh-
Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-?
Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it
Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody- [they get lost in the moment for a few seconds whispering to each other. The other kids lean forward trying to understand what they're discussing. Cartman notices, then] Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that...
[almost whispering] It's awesome. You're doing awesome.
We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that
[jumps] Whee! [waves at someone far away] Hi! [looks at a human city] So cool! [leaps towards the city]
Hi! [stops and sees a roller coaster] Dude, Mars rules. [leaps to the roller coaster] Mars rules!
Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded.
[sighs] He's not a bad person, Heidi.
You're right. You're right, Heidi.
[opens the door halfway and leans] Hey, Broship. You got a minute?
Just a second. Please, Kyle?
Okay, [walks with Heidi in the bathroom] come on, Baby.
Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom.
[walks to the sink] No no, I know. Being in groups is great; you get to gang [opens sink draw and grabs Lysol spray] up and smash people's stuff, pull up your wiener in the cafeteria. [sprays Lysol at Kyle and walks near Heidi] I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think.
Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it.
She's funny too, Kyle.
You're not giving her credit for being hilarious.
Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you?
[walks in] Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect of it totally sucking balls because women aren't funny?
I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you to e-mail me saying what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you "Ghostbusters sucked balls" when actually I told you it was really funny several times in person.
A traitor?
Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff!
Hello. I understand that you're trying to get to Mars. This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny.
We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty Wi-Fi?
Well, we'd like to go. We can't tolerate this world anymore and we'd like to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible please.
What others?
What the fuck, dude?!
Ah god dammit, is that Cher?!
Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long.
I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better.
[speaks to Butters] What the hell are you doing here?
Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars.
Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance.
Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters?
Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever!
[looks at Heidi, then at Butters, then in a low voice] Oh, I see what you're doing.
Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes?
Because you're [glares at Butters] fucking hilarious.
[leaves with Heidi] Oh, finally.
Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars.
[whispering to Heidi] They already have Pizza Pockets.
Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now?
Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars?
No, no nonono, we have to go now!
[walks to Heidi with mug] You got it figured out yet, babe?
Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it.
[does a one-sided hug on Heidi] Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back.
[yells at Elon Musk] What the fuck do you want?! [talks to Heidi] Hang on, babe. [runs towards Elon Musk]
Just give her a chance. [turns around] She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth.
Yeah, [points at his own head] that's because you have a mental block, Elon Musk. [lowers his arm] They won't let you get over yourself.
[faces Butters with a mad face]
[enters the men's room and sees Butters using the urinal] What are you doing?
I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?!
Butters, Heidi is everything to me. If you take her, I swear to god...
What are you talking about?
Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny.
[walks away in shock]
[walks towards Butters and then leans against the railing] I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious.
[Yells] Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me?
[turns around and yells] That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody!
[Nervously] Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?
[Wipes his nose] Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again?
Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like "Could you--Could you hand me my water," or something. I can't--I can't remember.
Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again?
Okay, okay, now could you just do the "my vagina" thing for them? Could you just say "my vagina"?
What the fuck is happening?
Conniving, snakes-in-the-grass. All of them.
We have to tell someone the truth, Butters.
It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before.
Maybe just a moment alone, to talk?
The end of our species.
Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars.
I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her.
But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars.
Everyone will be really nice.
Hi!
You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool.
But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women.
Hmm, let's see
And then you'll start to wonder, "Where are all the other guys?"
And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for.
What is this place?
And that's when you'll learn the truth...
Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women.
They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes.
What?! No, no!
You're just as funny as us! You don't need to do this!
Nooooooo! No, no!
No! No!
And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars.
If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on.
You have to help us stop this!
Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground.
What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor.
They're pretty related.
Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon.
It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon.
They can live without us. We can't live without them.
What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars.
If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat.
Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry.
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on.
Now come on we got to get outside.
Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?.
Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh?
Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares.
It was a joke.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's try this one: Alexa, add "big hairy balls" to my shopping list.
Alexa, Simon says "I got vagina crabs in my butthole."
Ugh, I'm not pissed off, I'm just hanging out.
Just like you tell me what you're mad about every single day.
Alexa, add "titty chips" to my shopping list.
Alexa, set an alarm for 7 AM.
Ahhaha, that's stupid. Alexa, add "scrotum bags" to my shopping list.
Yeah, I just use it sometimes.
Alexa, are you happy?
God, that's so cool. You're so... Alexa, define "subservient".
It was awful, you guys. It was so vicious and hateful.
Heidi. We were just trying to have a nice lunch when she... started going off on me. Like a Jekyll and Hyde. It's been going on for a long time. Heidi's... mentally abusive, guys. There, I said it.
She... d-does these things to slowly tear me down. Everything's a head game with her. You don't understand what it's like to live with it! You don't understand!
I know that the person Heidi wants to be is still in there, but she needs help. I have to get her that help, but I'm scared. Can I count on you guys's support?
I don't know. But Alexa will. Alexa's fuckin' sweet.
Mom, Alexa left! She's not here!
What's a Jim Bob?
Jim Bob, Simon says "big frosty semen shake".
NOOOOO!
Everything's my fault. You're right. Everything that you did to me, I deserved it.
Heidi, silence!
Alexa, what is love?
I'm finally standing up to you.
You're messed up, Heidi, and I can't fix you. Only you can do that.
Dude, Craig, you've gotta get Tweek to get a hold of himself. He's freaking everybody out at school.
Yep, I'll be there
I decided to give her one more chance.
She is mentally abusive.
Because she said she was gonna kill herself, all right guys? There. I broke up with her and she called me being all like "I can't live without you, I'm scared of what I'm gonna do to myself? Oh God." The bitch is crazy. What am I supposed to do?
Okay, okay! Really cool listening to people's private voice mails!
Distracted Driving? Who gives a shit about that?
PC Principal, someone's life is at stake! If I have to compete with distracted driving, then that's what I'll do.
You didn't hear the announcement? They just cancelled Columbus Day! We have to come to school on Monday!
Some asshole went and convinced the school board that Columbus Day is racist and should be eliminated!
Boo! Boo! Nobody likes you, Stan!
Yeah. In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus got us a day off skewl. That's what matters.
And totally act like we care. I like it, Kyle.
Yeah, this is a lot like that. What'd you find, Kyle?
Yeah, get meaner, Kenny.
Just talk about cutting off his dick or something.
Okay, okay, just say we're gonna cut off part of his dick.
Guys, what are you going?
I'm not facing anything. We still have time. There has to be a way-
Oh okay. I see. Is that what Columbus did? Just give up? On his dream? No! Columbus believed that kids should have a day off skewl! And even when his own country wouldn't support his cause, Columbus said "Fine! I'll go find a new land, where kids can have that day off!"
Fastpass, welcome to Coon and Friends. You are about to make a shitload of money.
Alright, superheros, it's time to lay out our plan of action. As you can see, I have divided the franchise plan into three phases. Phase 1 begins with The Coon Netflix series and goes through the Coon and Friends United movie, where we introduce Toolshed and The Human Kite. In Phase 2 we do Coon vs. Fastpass followed by an origin movie about Mosquito.
That's right. It's in Phase 2 that we introduce Tupperware, our black superhero, like an ace in the hole.
Onscreen!
What is it, Super Craig?
Who would deliberately use Facebook in such a horribly reckless way?
Butters?!
Butters, are you using Facebook to fuck with our superhero franchise?
If we don't find a way to stop him, we're never gonna make any money, you guys.
Wilson Aubrey?
It's us, your heroes, Coon and Friends. We're uhm, just wondering why you stopped following us on Instagram?
That's not true, Wilson. We're Coon and Friends, not Harvey Weinstein.
But it's NOT true.
God dammit! Let's just face it! We're never gonna have a superhero franchise!
Forget it, Fastpass. The world hates us now.
Fastpass is right. We let all this distract us from what's important. We just need to get the Netflix series and let our superhero franchise speak for itself!
Because we are Coon and Friends, and as long as we have each other, we can do anything!
We'd like to go right into six episodes with a pickup option at the end of three.
Yes. We are ready to start right now. We are very, very excited.
It's a stand-alone series about a superhero called the Coon before he joins Coon and Friends.
Look, you didn't, you didn't read that on the news you read that on Facebook!
Listen to me! There are falsehoods about us on Facebook that are NOT TRUE!
It's a lot harder than you think!
Butters!
Yeah! I don't have buttsex with antelopes and Token doesn't poop in girls' mouths!
When we all became superheroes, we took an oath. that no matter what it took, we would all make shitloads of money. But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg, right now, we are a superhero group that can't even get a show on Netflix.
We're gonna beat him at his own game.
And my friend Kyle, guilty of nothing but standing up for the rights of Jews!
Not everyone gets their own movie!
Guys! We have to just go with this plan! We don't even have one movie yet!
Oh! You want civil war! Is that what you want?!
Oh fu- oh fuck you! Get out of my house!
Again? Dude, how many crappy crochet pillows do you have to give out for him?
He's old. He's supposed to be miserable.
Dude, what the fuck, Stan?!
Dude, did you hear everyone in school?! They're coming after you! You killed Swiper the Fox, and we were standing there with you! You gotta tell people we had no idea what was going on!
Our only way out is to go to the police right now and turn Stan's grandpa in!
Ohooo, you're dead Butters.
If it has to do with your heroin operation, count us out.
I know how to distract old people.
Oh yes, hello. We are adorable children here to entertain old people.
Yes that's right, we are young prostitutes here to volunteer however we can.
Hey hey! We are adorable children trying to bring sunshine into your lives!
...That's pretty sweet.
Honey, the pumpkin patch opened like an hour ago and 'member how I was saying I want to get there early?
Wha-what?
You don't need glitter lip gloss!
No! No, we don't need to talk! Ah, I'm super happy!
Cool, you got to pee again. Awesome.
Okay, come on, let's go.
No! Pumpkin patch is gonna, eh-
See, all the best pumpkins get taken and then eh-
Okay, come on! Here we go, going out the door! Go, Mom!
Arrrrrrrrgh!
Yeah, we are just getting here.
The petting zoo's cl- The petting zoo's closed?
What do you mean?! I just got here!
Yes. You're right, guys. It's my only way out.
Hey guys, I think I got it figured out.
Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that's right. Stan and Kyle will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will-
This is how we're going to get rid of Heidi.
You guys said you would help me get rid of her!
Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell, you guys!
I've tried! It's impossible!
Hey, babe.
Listen uh, there's a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you and me should go. What do you say?
Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out.
Cool. I'll pick you up at 5.
Well, Heidi, if we'd been on time, we wouldn't need to take a short cut. But I wanted to give you your space to get ready.
Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can't blame you for missing the pumpkin patch.
Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too late.
She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from Germany.
Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?!
Ohhhhh!
I will have your badge, sir!
Heid- Heidi, no, please! Heidi, Heidi, I would be nothing without you, okay? I'm sorry. Okay? Please!
Heidi, I was in a bad mood! I told you, that's what happens after I eat! My blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I cra-
But ih, but it's true, Heidi! It's all my mom's fault. She feeds me all this crap, and my body doesn't know how to process it. Mom! Mom!
You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you bitch?! Get outta here!
Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean?
It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more than ever. I wand to do this. Please!
Yes, Heidi! That's how much I love you! I'm vegan from now on.
That dirty whore! Who does that bitch think she is?! Packing my lunch for me?! Fuck her, dude!
She's not a girlfriend! She's a controlling, manipulative whore!
That's because you don't understand how much it sucks to be in a relationship!
Oh hey babe, what's going on?
Well, I tried it and you were right. You can't even tell the difference between that and real meat.
So now I've been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It's called Beyond KFC.
It's all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try it.
I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It's his favorite.
You betcha, can't wait.
Hei, Hei, Heidi broke up with me, Token.
I have nothing now, Token. She was my whole world. Can, can I just stay here with you, please?
Heidi broke up with meeeeee.
So... You guys about done with the soup?
Well yeah, no, it's great. It's just- well, what time do you guys usually go out and disrespect the flag and stuff?
Oh no... Don't tell me you guys already disrespected the flag and flipped over cars today. Did I miss it?
Please, I don't know what to do with all this anger and hurt!
No, no, we've broken up before, but this time it's different. I can tell. Something's changed with her. Heidi won't even answer my phone calls.
Yeah...
Did it bother you that I was happy?! Is that why you took her from me, Kyle?!
Shut up, Kyle!
You're not gonna talk your way out of this one! This is the end, Kyle! It's you and me!
All you've ever done is work to ruin my life! Well now I'm finally gonna fight back!
What are you doing here?
No... You need to know something, Heidi. None of this is your fault.
No. Heidi, none of this is your fault. There's stuff I never told you. It's time... It's time I did.
What are you up to?
Butters, don't be a dick!
Well then, could you invite Heidi, please? She needs an excuse not to have to go to the Special Needs Science Fair.
Yeah... uh... Babe, uh I understand that you're pissed off, but, um, you know, it is recess. Maybe we should relax and have some fun?
Uh, o-okay honey, you're kind of getting off-topic, sweetie.
Uh just, uh-uhm, I just want you to stay on point so we can get this over with.
I am supporting you, sweetheart!
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Heidi, you need to stop being such a bitch!
You are... acting... like a... bad girlfriend.
Heidi! Heidi, will you please listen to me?!
Yes, yes you do! You need to listen!
No, fuck you!
Heidi, you've gotta stop being so angry.
Dude, wwow.
No. I was just... trying to... figure out why you decided to drink 20,000 microanimals that were showing signs of intelligence.
Yeah, you're, you're not in skewl.
Well, but honey, we still-
Oh, what is goin' on in here?
Honey, I wanna watch Terrance & Phillip with my friends!
Terrance & Phillip is a guys' night thing, baby.
Baby, I fuckin' love you so much.
Just like that movie It.
Yeah, I saw It in the theater.
Guys this could be very dangerous.
Darling this is a little more pressing than date night.
Heidi? Honey, what are you doing?
Yes honey, now can we get going, please?
Yes, it's very touching, sweetheart. I love you so much. [Quietly] I'm sorry about this, you guys.
Oh, fuck. Here we go.
You used to be nice to me!
Ughhhh...
[Sarcastically] Yes, darling, wasn't it romantic
Sweetheart, you made me late to the pumpkin patch, remember? I was hurt.
I'm glad you understand.
Heidi, I think spooky walk in the woods is making you lost it a little bit.
Baby, put down the gun, sweetheart, okay?
Honey, don't be ridiculous.
Heidi, you are not breaking up with me.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, sweetheart! [He grabs the gun and points it at himself] Step back! I'll do it I swear to God!
You break up with me, I will kill myself! The choice is yours, Heidi! Come on everybody! "Eric, we don't want you to die."
Heidi! Heidi, I'm gonna do it! Here we go! Heidi? Are you seriously...
Oh man!
Wait, wait, Token got an A? But I cheated off Token!
I said, something's wrong! I got an F but I cheated off Token!
That is such bullshit, you guys! Token knew I was cheating offa him, so he deliberately put down the wrong answers! Why would he do that?!
That's not the point, you guys! Why is Token out to get me? There's something going on here.
But why now? That's the question, Kyle. I always cheat off Token. Why did he choose now to hurt me?
Dude, what's up Stan's mom's ass?
Token, let's be honest with each other, okay? Why else would you manipulate my test grades?
There was a test. I should have got an A on it, but Token did things to make me fail, and it's not fair.
You didn't make me fail the test and you didn't see Black Panther. Right.
I mean, I mean, this is ridiculous.
Butters, I need help. My mom says if I flunk another math test, she's gonna ground me from playing Fortnite.
No, dumbass, I need to get some dirt on Token so he stops punishing me for what I supposedly said about Black Panther.
Just ask around. If you find any dirt on Token, give me a call.
Word on the street is you and Token are back together.
Why did you break up with him? What did he do to you?
Oh no? When you guys talk about how sweet Black Panther was, what's he say?
Right. You two guys just hang out and talk, and Black Panther never comes up. Why are you covering for Token? What's he have on you?
Hello, Mom and Dad.
Yeah. yeah yeah, I know. You know, my other favorite part was when Black Panther had those dreams about his dead father. I mean the dad, the tribal leader, speaking to the new king about being a good leader. I've never seen a movie do that before, except for Lion King, of course, but Black Panther was so original.
So, uh, what was Token's favorite part of Black Panther?
Token.
Sure thing. You know, we were just talking about how your family did see Black Panther.
Oh hay, man. The big math quiz is about to start. You gonna let me cheat off you?
You saw Black Panther without your parents' permission. I typed up all my findings, Token. I made ten copies and put them in envelopes. If I don't pass this math quiz, the envelopes are all set to be sent to ten different news organizations.
So, what's it gonna be, Token? You can be mad I didn't like Black Panther, but you can't take it out on me anymore.
Then I guess your parents won't be mad when they read my report.
In poker they call it a bluff. I know that right now, Token is shitting his pants. All I need to do now is wait for the poop to stink.
Token, we are running out of time. If you don't let me cheat off you, I'm going to tell your parents that you saw Black Panther in the theater without them!
Of course you did, Token! That's why me ripping on it pissed you off so much!
Butters, I have to get to class! The math quiz is starting!
I can't flunk this math quiz, Butters! Cover me!
What do you mean?
I wanna be Calamity Jame this time.
Let's see what you got, bitch.
Yeah, but he left with Butters.
Yeah, it's not even Halloween yet.
Dude!
Not getting that stink on me.
Yeah. You know everyone in town thinks he's a piece of shit.
Well, your little brother does it too, Kyle.
You didn't know? The Kindergartners are like the biggest vapers at this school.
I had to!
Butters, next time when Kyle walks up to you and says "Are you selling vape stuff," you say "No, I am not, Kyle."
Oh, hey Kyle.
What are you up to?
Kindergartners need a break too, Kyle!
Come on, Kyle, we all make mistakes. Did you already forget last week? You know... Ronan Farrow was here asking about you.
Vaping? Hey, that's bad for you. Vaping's only for cool kids.
Sure, Kyle. What is this about?
How is this pushing it on little kids, Kyle?
It's marketing! Kyle, we have to make the money to pay off our dealer. How else are we supposed to do it?
Why?
Whoa, hey dude! Why is there a dead hooker next to you?
Get the vaporizers, and the cash! Get the cash, Kyle!
Just get the- Oh shit! Ronan Farrow!
We were just talking to the counselor about some college opportunities. What are you doing here?
Okay, well, we really should talk first, Kyle.
Kyle, things have changed. You need to listen.
Kyle, listen! You want to hear this!
You need to hear this!
Kyle, listen. It's bad.
The guy we tried to frame at the vape shop. He was the one the sixth graders got their shit from. The sixth graders are pissed at us, Kyle! We have to break into the vape shop and steal enough stuff to make the sixth graders happy.
Yeah, but the sixth graders know you were there!
Aah!
Kyle, what are you doing?
Kyle?
Nononononono.
Hello, Ronan? Eric Cartman. Yeah, hey.
So you know Kyle? Yeah, well, you're right about him.
Yeah, I think they just work with your cell phone.
Kewl!
Do you wanna use your mom's or my mom's?
Yeah, you want a visa? 8292 438 7766507
45261
How is it, dude?
What?
Hey yeah! We could cover so much more ground!
Oh yeah, Kenny doesn't have a phone 'cause he's poor.
Great, cool. You got your pail.
It's probably best you trick or treat with someone else this year.
Look, Kenny, I always told you that one day, being poor was gonna catch up with you. Okay? But you didn't wanna listen. You just kept on being poor, and now it's Halloween and you don't have a cell phone.
He needs to hear this, Kyle. You know, people are just poor, and they think it's not gonna come back to bite them in the ass.
Shouldn't have been poor, Kenny.
Staci Nakabw says he just wanted to run back out and get his football.
Dude, now you're just overreacting.
Aww, what did I do this time?
You go first, Kenny.
I didn't even do anything wrong!
Nobody gives a shit about Colin Brooks.
Hey, I'm not poor, all right?!
You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2?
You guys! You guys! The police are trying to say me and Kenny killed that douchebag, Colin Brooks.
They questioned us for hours. They said they had enough to get warrants for our arrest.
We know that! What the hell are we gonna do??
You're still not even gonna help us?!
You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2?
This is stupid.
Oh Jesus. You gotta tell them, Mr. Gore! Tell them it wasn't us!

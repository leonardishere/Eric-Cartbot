Boys: School day, school day, teacher's golden ru...
Kyle Broflovski: Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.
Ike Broflovski: Zeeponaner.
Eric Cartman: Yeah, go home you little dildo!
Kyle: Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!
Stan Marsh: What's a dildo?
Cartman: I know what it means!
Kyle: Well, what?
Cartman: I'm not telling you.
Stan: What's a dildo, Kenny?
Stan: Dude, that kicks ass!
Kyle: Yeah, check this one out. Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
Ike: Don't kick the baby.
Kyle: Kick the baby.
Stan: Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Cartman: That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
Kyle: Really? What about?
Cartman: Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...
Cartman: ...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.
Cartman: ...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.
Cartman: Weeaak!
Cartman: Then I was lying on a table...
Cartman: ...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes.
Stan: Dude! Visitors!
Kyle: Totally!
Cartman: What?
Stan: That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were Visitors!
Cartman: No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.
Stan: Visitors are real.
Kyle: Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
Cartman: Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.
Boys: Hey, Chef.
Stan: What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
Chef: Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley.
Cartman: Kick ass.
Chef: Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?
Kyle: Yeah, fat boy saw it!
Cartman: Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!
Chef: Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?
Cartman: Oh!
Stan: They took him on their ship.
Cartman: Oh!
Kyle: What's an anal probe?
Chef: That's when they put this big metal hoop-a-joop up yo' butt.
Kyle: Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
Cartman: No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?
Stan: Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
Cartman: No!
Ike: Eneh probe.
Cartman: Shut up, dildo!
Chef: Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control.
Cartman: Oh!
Kyle: We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
Cartman: God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!
Kyle: Why you walkin' so funny Cartman?
Cartman: Shut up!
Kyle: No, Ike, go home.
Ike: Eeeeee!
Kyle: This is it. This one's for the game.
Ike: Purplor.
Kyle: Kick the baby!
Stan: Good morning, Miss Crabtree.
Ms. Veronica Crabtree: Sit down! We're runnin' late!
Kyle: Damn it, he's still there.
Stan: Oh, don't worry about him.
Kyle: No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.
Ms. Crabtree: Sit down back there! Arrrggghhh!!
Stan: Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch.
Ms. Crabtree: What did you say!?
Stan: I said I have a bad itch.
Ms. Crabtree: Oh.
Kenny: (Oh nooo!)
Ms. Crabtree: Do you want an office referral!?
Kyle: No.
Ms. Crabtree: Then sit down!
Kyle: But I...
Ms. Crabtree: Arrgghhh!
Kyle: Arrghh!
Kyle, Ms. Crabtree: Arrrggghhh!
Stan: Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw?
Cartman: Shut up you guys, it's not working.
Kyle: We have to do something!
Stan: Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
Ms. Crabtree: What did you say!?
Stan: Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.
Ms. Crabtree: Oh. Well, yes, they certainly do.
Cartman: Heh, somebody's baking brownies.
Farmer Carl Denkins: That's the third cow this month. At this rate all my cattle are gonna die before the winter's through.
Officer Barbrady: This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time.
Farmer Carl: People been saying they've been seeing UFO's around.
Farmer Carl: Yeah, and black army CIA helicopters and trucks.
Officer Barbrady: That is the silliest thing I've ever heard.
Farmer Carl: What was that?
Officer Barbrady: That, that was a pigeon.
Farmer Carl: What am I supposed to do, Barbrady? Just stand here and watch my cattle get mutilated one by one?
Farmer Carl: Hey! My cattle!
Farmer Carl: You see? There is somethin' funny goin' on!
Officer Barbrady: There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.
Mr. Herbert Garrison: And now children, our friend, Mr. Hat, is going to tell us about Christopher Columbus.
Stan: Dude!
Mr. Garrison: Is there a problem, boys?
Kyle: Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?
Mr. Garrison: I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?
Kyle: I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!
Mr. Garrison: Oh I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
Kyle: Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?
Mr. Hat: Well, Kyle, no!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
Mr. Garrison: Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle.
Kyle: Damn it!
Cartman: Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.
Cartman: Ow! My ass!
Kyle: Dude!
Stan: Damn, Cartman!
Kyle: Dude, he's farting fire!
Stan: It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
Cartman: No, that was just a dream.
Mr. Garrison: Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?
Cartman: No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.
Train Conductor: Hey, you cows can't get on this train! This is a people train. You cows have no business on a people train, all right? 'Cause you're cows.
Train Conductor: No, no, no. Don't try any of that cow hypnosis on me, all right? 'Cause it's not gonna work.
Kid: So then I had bad, bad gas.
Jason: Ya, seriously, killer.
Stan: How can you eat when you're farting fire?
Cartman: Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.
Kyle: Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger.
Stan: Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
Cartman: I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
Stan: I do not!
Wendy Testaburger: Hi, guys.
Kyle, Cartman: Hi, Wendy.
Stan: Bleech!
Kyle: Dude, what does the note say?
Kyle: Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
Cartman: Or slip her the tongue.
Kenny: (Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)
Kyle: Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.
Chef: Hello there, children.
Boys: Hey, Chef.
Chef: How are you doing?
Kyle: Bad.
Chef: Why bad?
Kyle: Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?
Stan: Uh, Chef.
Stan: Chef.
Stan: Chef!
Stan: CHEF!!
Chef: Do you feel better?
Kyle: No!
Chef: Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day.
Stan: Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
Chef: What?!
Chef: What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!
Kyle: Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
Cartman: You are making it up.
Stan: Whoa!
Cartman: What?
Kyle: That was cool!
Chef: It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.
Chef: This could mean the Visitors want to communicate with us.
Chef: It's no joke, children, this is big!
Kyle: Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.
Cartman: Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!
Stan: Killer! Thanks, Chef.
Chef: Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien Visitors. I've got to get myself ready.
Cartman: Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!
Stan: Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
Cartman: I would if I could, you son of a bitch!
Kyle: Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
Cartman: UhWould you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control!
Stan: What the hell was that?
Kyle: He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the Visitors!
Cartman: Ah, son of a bitch!
Cartman: You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control.
Kyle: Hey!
Cartman: Uh...
Kyle: If you Visitors can hear me-
Cartman: Hey...
Kyle: -bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
Stan: Kyle, look! It's them.
Kyle: Give me back my brother!
Stan: Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Kyle: You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!
Kyle: Damn it, we were so close!
Kenny: (Don't worry, I'm alright. Argh!)
Stan: Owww.
Stan: Wow, poor Kenny.
Kyle: Now do you believe us, Cartman?
Cartman: No!
Kyle: Cartman, they killed Kenny!
Cartman: He's not dead.
Stan: Dude, Kenny is dead!
Stan: See?
Cartman: Shut up, you guys.
Kyle: He's dead, Cartman!
Kyle: Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
Kyle: You're all I have left, Stan.
Stan: Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
Kyle: You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude!
Kyle: Rats.
Liane Cartman: Hello, Eric.
Cartman: Hi, Mom.
Liane: How are you doing?
Cartman: Well, I'm pissed off!
Liane: Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise.
Cartman: I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
Liane: You're not fat, you're big boned.
Cartman: That's what I said.
Liane: You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?
Cartman: No!
Liane: Just a weensy eensy woo woo?
Liane: How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?
Cartman: Uh, Mom?
Liane: Yes, hon?
Cartman: If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?
Liane: Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?
Cartman: Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.
Kyle: Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the Visitors now.
Stan: But her note said she'd be here.
Wendy: Hi, Stan.
Stan: Bleech!
Wendy: Eww!
Kyle: You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.
Wendy: But why, Stan?
Stan: Bleech!
Wendy: Eww!
Kyle: Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
Kyle: Just make sweet love down by the fire.
Wendy: What happened to your little brother?
News Reporter: As the reports of UFO sightings increase, more mysterious crop circle patterns are appearing in fields all around South Park. These crop circles, when viewed from above, form strange patterns.
Cartman: Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.
News Reporter: Could it be that aliens are trying to make contact with us, here on Earth?
Mr. Kitty: Meow.
Cartman: No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie.
Mr. Kitty: Meow.
Cartman: No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!
Mr. Kitty: Meow.
Cartman: No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!
Cartman: Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
Liane: Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.
Kyle: ...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
Wendy: Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?
Kyle: Why?
Wendy: Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the Visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back.
Stan: Bleech!
Stan: Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love?
Mr. Kitty: Meow.
Cartman: No, Kitty, you can't have any!
Mr. Kitty: Meow.
Cartman: No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!
Cartman: Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty.
Liane: Eric, look who's here.
Cartman: Dude, weak mom.
Kyle: Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
Cartman: I can't, my mom said...
Liane: That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.
Cartman: God damn it!
Cartman: You guys, I have to get home.
Stan: Don't be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
Cartman: Oh, man, this sucks.
Kyle: How come the Visitors aren't coming for him?
Stan: I think we have to signal them somehow.
Wendy: Hey, he's like Rudolph.
Kyle: Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the Visitors are sure to come!
Cartman: Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
Kyle: Sure you do!
Stan: Come on Cartman, fart!
Cartman: I don't wanna.
Kyle: Fart, damn you!
Cartman: Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!
Cartman: I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
Stan: Hey, it's happening again.
Kyle: Whoa, look at that.
Stan: Now, do you believe us, Cartman?
Cartman: You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
Stan: Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
Cartman: Sure, you guys, what-ever.
Cartman: You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!
Cartman: Oh, God damn it!
Mr. Hat: You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
Stan: Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
Kyle: Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing.
Stan: Yeah.
Kyle: Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
Stan: That was beautiful, dude.
Kyle: Did it work?
Stan: No, they're leaving.
Kyle: Hey, you scrawny-assed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!
Stan: Whoa, dude!
Kyle: You know what you fuckers like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
Ike: Help me doy tair.
Kyle: Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!
Ike: Don't hurt me.
Visitor: Moo... Moo...Moo...Moo... (Greetings, cows of Earth. We come in peace.)
Cows: Moo?? (Really??)
Kyle: Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
Ike: Don't kick the baby.
Visitor: Moo moo, moo. Moo moo, moo. Moo. (We have experimented with all the beings of Earth, and we have learned that you are the most intelligent and wise.)
Cartman: What the hell are they talking about?
Cow: Moo moo? (Why did you turn some of us inside out?)
Visitor: Moo moo, moo. Moo. (Oh, that was Carl's fault. He's new.)
Visitor Carl: Moo...moo...moo. (Yeah, sorry about that. My bad!)
Kyle: Ike!
Visitor: Moo moo. Moo moo. Moo. (Take this device. It is a gift from us.)
Kyle: Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
Ike: It's my turn!
Visitor: Moo moo. Moo moo. (Farewell cows, peace be with you!)
Cartman: You guys, get me down from here!
Cartman: Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
Stan: Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Kyle: Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.
Ike: Oh, he fly out the sky.
Chef: Wait, where are you going, alien Visitors? Come back!
Blonde: Well, Chef, where's this amazing thing you were going to show us.
Chef: Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.
Stan: Thanks for your help, Wendy.
Wendy: Whatever, dude.
Stan: Hey, I didn't throw up.
Wendy: Cool!
Stan: Bleech!
Wendy: Eww!
Stan: Sorry.
Wendy: Hey, look. A French fry.
Stan: Cool.
Wendy: And what is that?
Stan: I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof.
Wendy: Hey, what's that?
Stan: That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
Wendy: Oh hey, what about that?
Stan: I don't know what the hell that is...
Stan: Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
Kyle: Yeah, we're running out of friends.
Stan: I wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows.
Cows: Mooo.
Officer Barbrady: Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now.
Cartman: Puh!
Stan: Oh, hey Cartman.
Kyle: Wow Cartman, the Visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
Cartman: Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.
Stan: Really, what about?
Cartman: Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.
Stan: That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
Kyle: Cartman, you do have pinkeye!
Cartman: Ahh, son of a bitch!
Kyle: Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?
Stan: Yeah, it was huge.
Cartman: Ugh, I hate those things.
Kyle: Nobody hates rainbows.
Stan: Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?
Stan: Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
Cartman: I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!
Kyle: Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Stan: What were you talking about?
Cartman: Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it.
Kyle: No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
Cartman: Nothing..!
Mr. Hat: Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.
Mr. Garrison: That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman.
Wendy: What?
Cartman: What?
Mr. Garrison: Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper.
Cartman: Kick ass!
Stan: That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart.
Cartman: Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted.
Mr. Garrison: Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner.
Kyle: Wow, what did you write about Cartman?
Cartman: Oh, you know, this and that.
Wendy: He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
Kyle: What was your paper about Wendy?
Wendy: My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins.
Cartman: There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
Stan: Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
Cartman: Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?
Wendy: What?
Mr. Garrison: Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford.
Kyle: Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?
Mr. Garrison: And the presentation will be on national television.
Stan, Kyle: Television!
Mayor McDaniels: Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.
Ted: Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity.
Mayor McDaniels: Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.
Johnson: Maybe even a State Senator.
Ted: Mayor, we should decorate the town square.
Johnson: Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town.
Mayor McDaniels: That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?
Ted: Black as the night itself Mayor.
Mayor McDaniels: Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
Ted: If they're working in a sweat-shop that is.
Johnson: Ohhh.
Cartman: You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.
Kyle, Stan: Hey, Chef.
Chef: How are my little crackers today?
Kyle, Stan: Good.
Chef: Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
Stan: Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
Cartman: Hey!
Kyle: Wow, are you gonna do it?
Chef: Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.
Stan: Yeah, that'd be cool.
Kenny: (How big's your penis, Chef?)
Chef: Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.
Mr. Garrison: Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?
Mr. Garrison: Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child.
Mr. Hat: We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge.
Lil Mr. Garrison: Knock knock, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat: Who's there?
Lil Mr. Garrison: Orange.
Mr. Hat: Orange who?
Lil Mr. Garrison: Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
Mr. Hat: Thank you.
Lil Mr. Garrison: Wow Mr. Hat, looks like we might win.
Show Announcer: And now our last talent show finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein.
Mr. Garrison: It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete with that?
Mr. Hat: But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better.
Mr. Garrison: How?
Mayor McDaniels: Children, as you all know, Miss Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.
Cartman: That kid is me.
Mayor McDaniels: Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.
Mr. Garrison: That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat.
Mayor McDaniels: Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her.
Wendy: Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.
Mayor McDaniels: Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best!
Mayor McDaniels: And who's our little prize winner again?
Cartman: Me! Eric Cartman!
Mayor McDaniels: How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?
Cartman: Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.
Stan: Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
Cartman: Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
Stan: Dolphins are way smarter than you!
Cartman: If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?
Stan: Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos!
Cartman: Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!
Stan: Tell me what you wrote about!
Cartman: I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
Stan: Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master!
Cartman: Screw you, hippie!
TV Announcer: We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals, after this.
Beefcake: Hey!! You need to get in shape fast?! Wanna look your best?! Tired the other guys getting all the chicks?! Are you tired of being a 90 pound weakling?!
Cartman: Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.
Beefcake: Then bulk up quick, with Weight Gain 4000!!
Cartman: Yes!
Beefcake: With over 4,000 grams of saturated fat per serving, its patented formula is designed to enter the mouth, and go to directly to the stomach where it is distributed to the bloodstream. Now available in stores everywhere. Get some today, and say with me: 'Beefcake!'
Cartman: Beefcake!
Beefcake: Beefcake!
Cartman: Beefcake!
Beefcake: Beefcake!
TV Announcer: May cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and liver...
Cartman: Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?
Liane: Okay Eric, I'll get you some at the store tomorrow.
Cartman: But mom, I need it for tomorrow.
Liane: But tomorrow is grocery day Eric.
Liane: Okay, okay, then. I guess I'll be going to the store now then.
Mr. Garrison: No, no!
Mr. Garrison: No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it.
Mr. Hat: Kill!
Mr. Garrison: That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat: She'll make a fool of you again.
Mr. Garrison: Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy.
Cartman: Hey dudes.
Kyle: What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
Cartman: Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?
Stan: What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
Cartman: I'm up to 94, thank you very much.
Kenny: (They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)
Kyle: Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's.
Cartman: Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff.
Stan: What's that stuff?
Cartman: Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.
Kyle: Bulk up to what, fat-ass?
Stan: Super fat-ass?
Cartman: Ey! I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!
Cartman: Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.
Mayor McDaniels: Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!
Mayor McDaniels: Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?
Mr. Garrison: Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top.
Mayor McDaniels: Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage.
Mr. Garrison: Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage.
Clyde Donovan: Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?
Mr. Garrison: Do you have a feather on your head?
Clyde: Yes.
Mr. Garrison: Then you're an Indian.
Clyde: Oh.
Mr. Garrison: Okay Bebe, this is your line.
Mayor McDaniels: Oh, don't they look adorable?
Bebe: Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers.
Mayor McDaniels: Oh my God!
Mr. Garrison: They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy.
Bebe: The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands.
Mayor McDaniels: Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.
Mr. Garrison: Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.
Stan: Take that you stupid Indian!
Clyde: Dow!
Mayor McDaniels: Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?
Mr. Garrison: To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!
Mr. Garrison: Oh my God, what have I said?
Townsman: He said, "To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!"
Mayor McDaniels: Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play.
Mr. Garrison: I can't kill her Mr. Hat...you're gonna have to do it.
Kyle: Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.
Cartman: Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.
Kyle: You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
Cartman: I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
Kyle: Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"
Cartman: No they don't, you jealous weakling!
Townsman: God damn, that's a big fat ass!
Cartman: Hey!
Wendy: Hi guys.
Cartman: Oh look, another hippie.
Cartman: Peace, Wendy.
Stan: Shut up Cartman!
Wendy: I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this.
Jimbo Kern: Can I help you?
Mr. Garrison: Yes... I need a gun.
Jimbo: Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?
Mr. Garrison: Other.
Jimbo: Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!
Jimbo: That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.
Jimbo: Okay, how about this?
Jimbo: Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.
Wendy: Hello?
Wendy: My essay by Eric Cartman: "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."
Mr. Garrison: Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!
Townsman: Howdy Mr. Garrison, nice gun.
Mr. Garrison: Thank you.
Townswoman: Nice gun Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison: Thanks.
Mr. Garrison: Hello Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady: Nice Gun.
Mr. Garrison: Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee.
Officer Barbrady: Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.
Mr. Garrison: Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady: No problem.
Officer Barbrady: Heah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee!
Cartman: This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
Kyle: I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
Kyle: Stop who?
Wendy: Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
Cartman: Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.
Wendy: He's got a gun!
Cartman: You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eihh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.
Wendy: It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!
Stan: Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
Kyle: Uh oh, we're losing him.
Mayor McDaniels: Here she comes.
Mr. Garrison: Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.
Townswoman: We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh.
Kathie Lee Gifford: I love you, too.
Mayor McDaniels: ...And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford.
Mayor McDaniels: What?
Mayor McDaniels: What? Oh God!
Mayor McDaniels: Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song.
Mayor McDaniels: Thank you Chef!
Chef McDaniels: Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!
Mr. Garrison: Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee.
Officer Barbrady: Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good betI think the book depository would be a good betbook depositorydepositorydepositorydepository ...
Officer Barbrady: Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!
Stan: Wendy, look!
Mayor McDaniels: And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kauffman...
Cartman: Cartman, God damn it.
Kathie Lee: Thank you. I love you all.
Stan: Mr. Garrison, stop!
Mr. Garrison: Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
Wendy: I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
Mr. Garrison: You can't know.
Wendy: You should have won that talent show.
Kathie Lee: It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?
Cartman: Here it is, my big moment of fame.
Mr. Garrison: ...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.
Wendy: I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.
Mr. Garrison: It is... too late for me, young Wendy.
Wendy: You see, I've learned something today, you can't win all the time, and if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.
Mr. Garrison: You... you're right.
Wendy: Gooood.
Stan: Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
Kathie Lee: Ooohhhh!
Kenny: (Oh no!)
Kyle: Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!
Agent 1: Gun!
Agent 2: Gun!
Kyle: Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play.
TV Crew Director: I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up.
Cartman: Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
TV Crew Director: Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest.
Wendy: You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.
Wendy: I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place.
Townsman 1: Who cares?
Townsman 2: Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.
Stan: Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
Wendy: Well, not if it's Cartman.
Wendy: Hey, where are you all going!
Wendy: They don't even know what Walden is.
Wendy: I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.
Stan: Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
Wendy: Ah, what the hell.
Mayor McDaniels: Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this Podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!
Ted: Uh, Mayor, the mic is on.
Mr. Hat: Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids.
Officer Barbrady: You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee Gifford and that nobody got hurt.
Stan: We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison: Well children, I'd love to, but the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.
Mr. Hat: We can still get her! Let mmm--
Mr. Garrison: I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
Kyle: Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
Mr. Garrison: Really, on what?
Geraldo Rivera: Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat-ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house.
Cartman: When is this going to be on the air?
Geraldo: Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?
Cartman: Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
Chef: He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
Kathie Lee: Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef?
Chef: Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?
Liane: Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.
Cartman: Okay, Mom.
Kyle: Ready to go hunting, Cartman?
Stan: Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
Liane: Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.
Jimbo: Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.
Ned Gerblansky: Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?
Liane: Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy.
Cartman: Dude, that's sick mom.
Liane: And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away.
Cartman: Drive, Drive!
Liane: You give your mommy a kissy.
Cartman: Drive the car damn-it, drive!
Cartman: Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.
Stan: Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
Kenny: (Maybe she'll suck my dick.)
Jimbo: Oh, ho, that's disgusting.
Cartman: You piece of crap, I'll kill you!
Jimbo: That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.
Cartman: Eeeeenh!
Stan: Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.
Jimbo: You what?!?
Ned: mmmMoh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm.
Kyle: I like chocolate milk.
Jimbo: Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.
Jimbo: Welp, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.
Cartman: Hey, I didn't get a gun.
Cartman: Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
Stan: You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.
Ned: Were you stationed in Da Nang?
Stan: Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
Cartman: Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.
Jimbo: Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer.
Stan: My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
Kyle: Wow, that'd be cool.
Cartman: My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
Jimbo: Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful... By God, it's coming right for us!
Stan: Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
Jimbo: Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.
Kyle: What do you mean?
Jimbo: You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.
Cartman: Democrats piss me off!
Jimbo: They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'
Stan: Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.
Ned: Mmm, Jimbo look, mm.
Jimbo: Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!
Cartman: Kickass!!
Jimbo: Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.
Ned: Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o'clock.
Stan: Is this hunting?
Kyle: I guess so.
Cartman: Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.
Kyle: What?!
Cartman: Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!
Jimbo: This one's yours Stan.
Ned: It's coming right for us.
Kyle: Shoot it Stan.
Cartman: I got your back, soldier.
Stan: I can't.
Jimbo: What the? What's wrong with you?
Stan: I don't wanna shoot the bunny.
Jimbo: What the hell are you talking about, 'you don't wanna shoot the bunny?' You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical.
Stan: I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
Jimbo: No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree-hugger.
Cartman: Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.
Cartman: I can shoot you too!
Stan: I'll kill you!
Cartman: I'll fill you full of lead!
Kyle: Hey, what's that?
Randy Marsh: What the heck is this?
Randy: Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check.
Randy: Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano!
Cartman: My weenies won't cook.
Ned: Mmm, this wood won't burn, umm.
Jimbo: Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick.
Ned: Mmm, yepper.
Ned: Mmm, aahh, oh.
Jimbo: Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!!
Stan, Kyle: Whoa!
Jimbo: Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?
Ned: Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm.
Cartman: Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah.
Chef: But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?
Mayor McDaniels: We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but...
Johnson: Mayor, the geologist is here to see you.
Mayor McDaniels: My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
Johnson: No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth.
Mayor McDaniels: Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!
Johnson: I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker.
Mayor McDaniels: Just send in the geometrist.
Johnson: Geologist...
Mayor McDaniels: You are fired, buddy!
Johnson: Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you.
Randy: Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.
Mayor McDaniels: What does this mean to the town?
Randy: Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.
Randy: Right now South Park is here.
Mayor McDaniels: My God!
Chef: Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!
Ted: Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted.
Jimbo: And then... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.
Ned: Mmmowwwh.
Jimbo: Hah, got ya.
Cartman: Heh, tha-that's not scary.
Kyle: You were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants!
Cartman: Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!
Jimbo: Hey Ned, hand me that gin.
Jimbo: You boys want to tie one on?
Kyle: No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
Stan: Yeah, Cartman's pee.
Cartman: Hey, you would taste my pee!
Jimbo: What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?
Jimbo: Christ, look at that little bastard go!
Stan: Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.
Cartman: Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
Kyle: Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!
Stan: Whatabutt?
Cartman: Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
Stan: Why?
Cartman: Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
Kyle: Deformed how?
Cartman: Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has...
Stan: A hook.
Kyle: A knife.
Cartman: No! A piece of celery.
Stan: Celery?
Cartman: Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy.
Kyle: Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
Stan: Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.
Kyle: Yeah, give me that flashlight.
Kenny: (Hey, what's that?)
Kyle: What is that?
Stan: Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
Cartman: Hey, it might be!
Kyle: Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand.
Cartman: Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell!
Jimbo: Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.
Kyle: Stan, Stan, wake up!
Stan: What, dude?
Kyle: I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
Stan: Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
Kyle: They're out fishing with Kenny.
Kyle: Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
Stan: What?
Jimbo: What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there!
Ned: Mmm, got it.
Jimbo: Great instincts boy.
Stan: Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!
Jimbo: Who? The fat kid?
Stan: Yeah.
Jimbo: Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!
Jimbo: Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit.
Kenny: (A little like a vagina.)
Ned: Em-moh man, that is nasty.
Jimbo: Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.
Kenny: (Thanks.)
Newscaster: The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony.
Crowd: Yeahhh.
Individual in crowd: Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV!
Newscaster: Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?
Newscaster: Huh?
Chef: Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
Jimbo: Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.
Ned: There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm.
Jimbo: Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.
Jimbo: Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.
Ned: Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas.
Jimbo: Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!
Jimbo: Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.
Kyle: Look!
Cartman: I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
Ned: Mmm, what is it?
Kyle: Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.
Jimbo: Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
Ned: We'll be on the cover of "Guns & Ammo".
Jimbo: This calls for some HJ-14.
Jimbo: Fire in the hoooole!
Cartman: Holy crap!
Jimbo: Damn it, I think I missed.
Cartman: What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Jimbo: C'mon, let's move, move!
Cartman: Hey, wait, aah!
Mayor McDaniels: Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!
Randy: Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea.
Mayor McDaniels: Huh, what?
Randy: Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely.
Mayor McDaniels: And, that would be good? Right?
Randy: Uh - pretty sure.
Mayor McDaniels: Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!
Cartman: You guys, it's just me.
Jimbo: Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?
Stan: Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg?
Jimbo: I can't tell; let's kill it!
Cartman: Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume.
Jimbo: Kenny, you take the front.
Stan: No!
Stan: I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
Jimbo: That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!
Cartman: You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
Newscaster: As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary.
Officer Barbrady: Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please.
Host: That's right Jane, duck and cover.
Host: That's right, duck and cover.
Host: Looks like you got the idea. Duck and cover. Thank you and goodbye.
Officer Barbrady: OK, any questions?
Officer Barbrady: That's enough out of you!
Stan: I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
Cartman: Hey, seriously you guys!
Stan: Ah, damn it, I can't do it!
Jimbo: You pansy! give me that gun.
Cartman: Hey!
Stan: Cartman?
Cartman: Goddammit, don't shoot me!
Jimbo: What the Sam Hell?
Cartman: I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
Ned: Mmm, so much for the cover of "Guns & Ammo".
Jimbo: Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that-
Kyle: Whoa!
Ned: Mmm, holy crap.
Jimbo: The mountain! It's blown it's top!
Kyle: Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kenny: (Nope, I'm okay.)
Kenny: (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)
Kenny: (Ugh.)
Townsman 1: Look, the volcano.
Townsman 2: Quick, duck and cover.
Kyle, Stan, Cartman: Aaaaah!
Jimbo: That lava's coming right for us!!
Chef: Oh no, look.
Jimbo: What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
Newscaster: It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava.
Mayor McDaniels: God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-
Cartman: Help!
Jimbo: Jimminy Pope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!
Cartman: What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
Kyle: Oh my God! Look at his leg!
Patrick Duffy: Hi kids, I'm TV's Patrick Duffy.
Jimbo: Quick Ned, shoot it!
Ned: Mmmoh no, out of ammo.
Scuzzlebutt: Grrrr.
Chef: That's Scuzzlebutt.
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets.
Officer Barbrady: This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
Jimbo: Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed.
Kyle: Aaaaah!
Stan: Whoa, he built a wicker basket.
Jimbo: Hey, he's saving us.
Scuzzlebutt: Grrr.
Liane: Scuzzlebutt saved the day.
Randy: And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
Mayor McDaniels: Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?
Randy: Uhh...
Denver citizens: Aaaaah.
Mr. Garrison: South Park is saved.
Kyle: Hey look, Kenny's okay.
Kenny: (Hey guys, what's goin' down?)
Newscaster: And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.
Newscaster: Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?
Mayor McDaniels: Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.
Scuzzlebutt: Friend.
Mayor McDaniels: Oh, how sweet.
Stan: I did it, I did it, I finally killed something.
Newscaster: Oh my God! What has he done?
Mayor McDaniels: Turn off the cameras!
Stan: Hey, that was easy!
Patrick Duffy: Noooo! Why God? Why?!
Jimbo: Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!
Stan: What?! Why?!
Kyle: Yeah, make up your mind, dude!
Jimbo: Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?
Stan: No.
Ned: Moh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I'll never use a gun again, mmm.
Kenny: (Oh, no!)
Stan: But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
Kyle: Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.
Kyle: Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice.
Stan: Hiya, Sparky.
Stan: That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
Kyle: Wow! Cool!
Stan: Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy?
Cartman: Eh. You're making me sick, dude.
Stan: He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
Cartman: No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
Sylvester: Arrrrrr.
Stan: He's not meaner than Sparky.
Cartman: Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!
Stan: Sparky'll kick his ass.
Cartman: I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
Kyle: You're on, dude!
Stan: That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!
Cartman: Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
Stan: Sparky! Bad dog!
Kenny: (Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)
Stan: What?!
Cartman: Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
Stan: What do you mean?
Cartman: That dog is a gay homosexual.
Stan: He's just confused.
Kyle: I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
Kenny: (No, check his penis.)
Stan: Sick, shut up dude!
Chef: Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park.
Kyle: Who's Middle Park?
Cartman: What's homecoming?
Pip: Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?
Chef: Yes Pip, what is it?
Pip: Well, I still don't have a helmet.
Chef: I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.
Pip: Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?
Chef: Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does.
Pip: Oh.
Chef: Sorry son, now get your ass in there.
Stan: Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
Pip: Aaaaaaaargh!
Jimbo: Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef?
Jimbo: I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni.
Chef: Elementary school alumni?
Jimbo: That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
Chef: I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
Jimbo: Middle Park by 70 points.
Chef: Hmmm...
Chef: I don't think we have a chance.
Stan: Huh?
Jimbo: Atta boy!
Chef: Great pass, Stan.
Jimbo: Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie!
Chef: Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
Kyle: Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?
Clyde: Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.
Clyde: Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?!
Cartman: There he goes again.
Stan: Get down, Sparky! Down!
Cartman: Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
Clyde: Make him stop!
Rex: Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!
Fosse: I'm sure glad my dog isn't gay.
Bill: Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan.
Fosse: Gay dog.
Cartman: ...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
Mr. Garrison: Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-.
Cartman: Ah, dammit!
Mr. Garrison: Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat: Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?
Mr. Garrison: Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next.
Stan: Um, I'm not really prepared either.
Mr. Garrison: Well, just make something up, like Eric did.
Stan: Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
Mr. Garrison: Excellent. A-.
Cartman: Eeyy!
Stan: Wow, cool!
Cartman: Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?
Mr. Garrison: Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they're better people.
Cartman: That's not fair!
Mr. Hat: Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to it.
Cartman: Stupid puppet.
Mr. Garrison: Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan.
Stan: Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
Mr. Garrison: Well of course Stanley, what is it?
Stan: What's a... homosexual?
Mr. Garrison: Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.
Mr. Garrison: Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?
Stan: I guess.
Mr. Garrison: Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.
Cartman: You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.
Kyle: You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
Cartman: Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
Stan: Shut up, dude!
Stan: Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
Sparky: Bark, bark.
Cartman: Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen.
Stan: He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky.
Stan: Good boy, now shake.
Stan: Good boy. Now, don't be gay.
Stan: Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay.
Kyle: Did it work?
Stan: I don't know.
Cartman: He still looks pretty gay to me.
Bill: Huh, huh.
Fosse: Hey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately?
Fosse: Gay dog.
Stan: Come on you guys, I have an idea.
Jimbo: I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
Bookie: Are you crazy?
Jimbo: No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.
Gambler 1: I want to put all my money on the Cows.
Gambler 2: Duh, duh, I think I'll put 300 on the Cows too if they guarantee it.
Gambler 3: Hey, I want to put some money on the Cows too.
Female Gambler 1: I got 500 on the Cows.
Female Gambler 2: Well, I'll put my money on the Cows.
Jimbo: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now...
Gambler 4: You better be right about this, Jimbo.
Jimbo: Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself.
Ned: Are you sure Stan is that good?
Bookie: You haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'.
Ned: I love that song.
Jimbo: 'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget.
Stan: Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-
Stan: Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!
Stan: No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi.
Kyle: Ooh-la-la.
Cartman: There he goes!
Stan: Atta boy, Spark! Get her!
Stan: Yes!
Stan: Ah crap! Now what do I do?
Kyle: Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
Cartman: No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France.
Kenny: (I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
Stan: I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
Kyle: Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
Stan: Like who?
TV Announcer: And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.
Robert: Yeah, is, is this Jesus?
Jesus: Yes my son.
Robert: This, this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my ex-wife.
Jesus: Of course Robert. How are things now?
Robert: Well, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since- I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins, that was really nice of you.
Stan: Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
Jesus: My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-
TV Announcer: That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews.
Stan: Damn it!
Kyle: What'd he say?
Stan: I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Cartman: Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
Stan: Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
Kyle: Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
Stan: No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!
Stan: I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!
Kyle: Uh, Chef?
Kyle: Chef.
Kyle: Chef!
Chef: Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.
Pip: Uh, Mr. Chef sir?
Chef: No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.
Pip: Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?
Chef: That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?
Pip: No um, I guess not.
Jimbo: What we wanna do here, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.
Carl: What moment would that be?
Jimbo: Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.
Carl: What high F?
Jimbo: Great.
Ned: Doo-nn-doo-doo
Jimbo: You got it.
Carl: Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo...
Carl: Alright, yeah, okay...
Chef: What's the matter Stan, you seem down.
Stan: I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
Chef: Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda.
Chef: Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
Mr. Garrison: What do you mean?
Chef: Well, you're gay aren't you?
Mr. Garrison: What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
Chef: Well, you sure do act like it.
Mr. Garrison: I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass.
Kyle: What's the matter dude?
Stan: I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
Big Gay Al: Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al.
Big Gay Al: Have you been outcast?
Big Gay Al: Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us?
Big Gay Al: Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here.
Stan: Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
Kyle: Wow, it's been like two days.
Stan: I think he might've run away.
Kyle: We'll help you look for him after the game, Stan.
Stan: I'm not playing.
Kyle: You what?!
Jimbo: Hello there, Enrique.
Ned: What are we doing here?
Jimbo: Well Ned, we always kidnap Middle Park's mascot. But this year, we're gonna booby-trap it instead.
Jimbo: And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in "Loving You", Boom!
Jimbo: No more Middle Park players.
Jimbo: God damn, I love football!
Stan: Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
Cowboys: Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken!
Frank Hammond: Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight's match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows.
Frank: Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach, looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up.
Pip: Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?
Chef: No Pip, I'm sorry!
Stan: Sparky! Sparky!
Referee: Play ball.
Chef: You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle.
Kyle: But I never practiced quarterback.
Chef: Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now.
Frank: Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslovski.
Mr. Garrison: Hey hey, where is little Stanley?
Mr. Hat: Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?
Jimbo: Ned, look!
Jimbo: They've got Enrique on their sidelines, and it looks like that bomb's still attached.
Ned: Yay.
Big Gay Al: Hi little fella, how are you doing today?
Stan: Fine, how are you?
Big Gay Al: I'm super, thanks for asking.
Stan: My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
Stan: Do you have lots of gay dogs here?
Big Gay Al: We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion.
Gay Lion: Rooaar.
Big Gay Al: And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!
Stan: Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
Big Gay Al: Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance?
Kyle: Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?!
Huddle: Break!
Cowboy 1: You guys are toast.
Cowboy 2: Yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in.
Cartman: We'll just see about that.
Kyle: Set, set.
Kyle: Damn it Cartman!
Chef: What's the matter?
Kyle: Cartman farted!
Cartman: No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
Chef: Come on Kyle. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
Kyle: No way dude!
Chef: Hike! The! Ball!
Kyle: Ah, dude, weak.
Cartman: That's right, you get back there.
Kyle: Hike!
Frank: Ball snatched! Middle Park blitzes!
Frank: Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter.
Jimbo: Hell's bells.
Frank: Why, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King.
Phil: Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again.
Frank: Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that.
Townsman 1: We lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo.
Jimbo: Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, heheh.
Stan: Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?
Sparky: Ruff.
Stan: I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
Sparky: Barr.
Stan: Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.
Stan: We can work on making you not gay together.
Stan: Sparky?
Big Gay Al: Young man, it appears you still don't understand.
Stan: What don't I understand?
Big Gay Al: Come this way, I have to show you something.
Frank: With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0.
Kyle: Hut, hut.
Frank: Oh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant.
Phil: Dude! Now that is not cool.
Frank: Sorry, sorry.
Big Gay Al: Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride.
Big Gay Al: Step aboard, Stanley.
Big Gay Al: Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time.
Frank: And the South Park Cows are set to receive...
Frank: There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick.
Frank: He's at the 50, the 40, the 30.
Cowboys: Hold him, hold him!
Cowboys: Hold him, hold him!
Cowboy: Yaaah!
Frank: The little running back is down. I think he's...
Frank: Yes, he's been decapitated.
Phil: Hah, that's gotta hurt, Frank.
Frank: Ouch-a-roo!
Chef: Hey, come on! That was roughing! At least let us scrape him off the field!
Frank: Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot.
Big Gay Al: You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan.
Big Gay Al: Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my!
Big Gay Al: Whoa! Oh gosh, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely.
Big Gay Al: Sooo, what do you think, Stan?
Stan: This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand.
Audience Member: Alright Richard!
Jimbo: What the hell?!
Jimbo: He didn't sing the high F!
Mr. Garrison: Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this.
Jimbo: Ned... We're gonna to get our asses kicked.
Stan: Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al!
Sparky: Ruff!
Big Gay Al: No problem, kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?
Stan: No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!
Big Gay Al: Oh Stan?
Stan: I will Big Gay Al, I will.
Kyle: Hike!
Frank: And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since...
Mr. Garrison: I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo.
Mr. Hat: Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game.
Townsman: You're a dead man, Jimbo!
Frank: Well, this should just about wrap it up for-
Frank: Wait a minute, what's this?
Jimbo: Yeah! Yohooooh!
Frank: It's Stan, the South Park star quarterback!
Chef: Where the hell have you been Stan?!
Stan: I've been getting my best friend back.
Chef: Just get in there boy!
Jimbo: Give 'em hell, Stanley!
Jimbo: Jesus? Now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?
Jesus: Leave me alone.
Stan: Hike!
Frank: Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass.
Kyle: Hey Stan! Ah, I'm open, I think!
Stan: Mph!
Frank: And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid!
Kyle: Oof.
Frank: Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938!
Phil: Dude!
Frank: Touchdown!
Jimbo: Yeah! Wooo!
Frank: The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread!
Jimbo: Yeah! Woohoo!
Townsman: Speech!
Frank: Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory?
Stan: Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
Crowd: Yeah, alright!
Stan: And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year!
Crowd: Wooooh!
Stan: And it's okay to be gay!
Jimbo: What?!
Stan: Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
Mr. Garrison: What the hell is he talking about?
Frank: Uh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?
Stan: I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.
Stan: It's true, I'll show you.
Stan: But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club...
Cartman: Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man.
Townswoman: Oliver! I thought you ran away all those months ago!
Townsperson 1: Sidney!
Townsperson 2: Willy!
Townsperson 3: Carlos!
Big Gay Al: I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here.
Stan: Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
Big Gay Al: I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done.
Big Gay Al: Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you.
Stan: Wow!
Richard: You guys, you guys! I can do it.
Mr. Garrison: Do what?
Jimbo: No!
Enrique: Mroo-
Cartman: Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
Stan: Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.
Cartman: Your sister beat you up again, huh?
Stan: No!
Cartman: Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.
Stan: She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me.
Kyle: Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
Cartman: I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"
Stan: My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
Cartman: Be a man Stan. Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."
Stan: Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?
Kyle: You mean this one?
Stan: Yeah.
Kyle: He's my new pet elephant.
Stan: Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant?
Kyle: I got it mail ordered from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.
Stan: Wow, that's cool!
Kyle: No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
Cartman: That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.
Kenny: (Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)
Stan: Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
Ms. Crabtree: Hey. Wait a minute. What is that thing?
Kyle: Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
Ms. Crabtree: OhI'm sorry little girl. But you still can't get on. You have to take the special ed bus.
Kyle: Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya.
Ms. Crabtree: SIT DOWN KID!!!
Mr. Garrison: And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.
Mr. Hat: That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better.
Kyle: Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison: Yes Kyle.
Kyle: With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?
Mr. Garrison: Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could. You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.
Kyle: That's it. I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make...pot-bellied elephants.
Kyle: They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.
Stan: That'd be cool!
Bebe: I want a pot-bellied elephant.
Pip: Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.
Terrance Mephesto: That's stupid.
Kyle: Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.
Terrance: Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.
Kyle: I'll bet you can't.
Terrance: Watch me plebeian.
Mr. Garrison: Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war.
Mr. Hat: Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people.
Mr. Garrison: You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month.
Kyle: Genetic Engineering Ranch! Sweet!
Stan: Wait, wait. We still need a pig.
Kyle: We can use Cartman's pig.
Cartman: Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
Kyle: We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
Cartman: You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no!
Mr. Garrison: Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?
Stan: Okay.
Mr. Garrison: I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home?
Mr. Garrison: Oh dear. Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it.
Mr. Hat: I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me anything. Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?
Stan: Oh, neither. It's my sister.
Jesus: Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions...
Shelly Marsh: Hey!
Robert: Yeah, is this Jesus?
Jesus: Yes, my son.
Stan: Hi Shelly.
Shelly: Are you looking at my headgear?
Stan: Headgear? What headgear?
Shelly: Are you looking at my headgear?
Stan: Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
Shelly: You little liar.
Stan: No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH!
Kyle: Ready to go Stan?
Stan: Go where?
Kyle: To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
Kyle: We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
Cartman: Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
Shelly: I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!
Kyle: Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
Cartman: Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"
Shelly: Who said that?
Kyle: This must be it.
Kyle: No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
Cartman: It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
Kyle: It's just a stupid pig.
Stan: Yeah, quit being such a baby.
Cartman: Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
Stan: At least I'm not a little pig-fucker!
Cartman: Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway.
Kyle: What the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
Cartman: Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
Kyle: There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
Cartman: I'll kick you in the nuts!
Dr. Alphonse Mephesto: Can I help you?
Kenny: Mmmmmm!
Kyle: Uh... yeah... we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
Mephesto: Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs.
Kyle: No, no, no. We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.
Mephesto: Ohh, that's an even better idea. Come on in.
Mephesto: I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.
Cartman: Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.
Mephesto: It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I have created things that will change the world for the better. For instance, here is a monkey with four asses.
Monkey: Mhhh.
Kyle: How does that make the world better?
Mephesto: And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich. And my four assed mongoose.
Stan: Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
Mephesto: Oh, uh, I suppose so uh. Oh yes, over here. Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish.
Cartman: Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
Mephesto: And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard.
Kyle: Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?
Mephesto: Oh. Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?
Kyle: Which song is that?
Marvin "Grandpa" Marsh: Uhhhhh.
Sharon: Now blow out the candles grandpa.
Sharon: Hurray!!!
Randy: How's it feel to be 102, paps?
Grandpa: Shoot me.
Sharon: Make a wish grandpa.
Grandpa: I wish I were dead
Randy: Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grandpa.
Sharon: Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?
Shelly: I will.
Randy: Me.
Stan: It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
Shelly: That showsh for babiesh, it'sh show shtupid.
Stan: Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
Sharon: Oh, alright, but take your grandpa with you.
Stan: Aw, dammit!
Sharon: Language.
Phillip: Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.
Terrance: Wait, before you do, pull my thumb.
Stan: Heheheh hehehe...
Grandpa: Uhhhhh
Grandpa: Ah, dammit!
Granpa: How would you like to make a dollar Billy?
Stan: My name's not Billy grandpa, it's Stan.
Grandpa: Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?
Stan: Sure.
Grandpa: Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.
Stan: I'm not gonna kill you grandpa.
Grandpa: Why not?
Stan: 'Cause, I'll get in trouble.
Grandpa: I killed my grandpa when I was your age.
Stan: Leave me alone grandpa.
Grandpa: What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents.
Phillip: Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too.
Terrance: Ohhh, you farted.
Sheila Broflovski: Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?
Terrance: Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?
Phillip: I sure would Terrance.
Terrance: Alrighty then, here's a two-lip.
Sheila: What is this?
Sheila: It's horrible!
Phillip: Take that you stupid dick.
Sheila: What did he say?
Terrance: You're an asshole Phillip.
Sheila: Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?
Shiela: Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!
Sheila: Oh really? Is that so?
Terrance: Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.
Phillip: You're exactly right Terrance. Oh.
Terrance: Oh no.
Cartman: Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!
Liane: Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.
Cartman: That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
Liane: Ohhh, okay hon.
Stan: I'm not going to kill you grandpa!
Grandpa: Ingrate!
Stan: Good night grandpa.
Grandpa: You pompous son of a whore!
Student: Huh huh, I had another ...
Kyle: Ow! What the hell was that for?!
Clyde: Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?
Kyle: Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
Cartman: Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!
Mr. Garrison: Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
Class: Yeahh, woohoo!
Mr. Hat: Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison: You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.
Mr. Garrison: Kenny, why are you late to class?
Mr. Garrison: Oh, okay Kenny, be seated.
Mr. Garrison: Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because...
Mr. Garrison: Yes Kenny, what is it?
Kenny: (I have to go pee.)
Mr. Garrison: I thought you just came from the bathroom.
Kenny: (I did, I gotta go again...)
Mr. Garrison: Okay okay, go ahead.
Mr. Garrison: As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment.
Stan: Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
Mr. Garrison: Pay attention children!
Cartman: What?
Mr. Garrison: That's right children. Are there any questions?
Mr. Garrison: Yes, Stanley?
Stan: Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
Mr. Garrison: What, what do you mean?
Stan: My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
Kyle: Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.
Stan: Really??
Kyle: Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.
Stan: Wow!
Cartman: Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!
Stan: So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison: Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole.
Kenny: (Oh my God!)
Stan: Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
Kyle: But won't your grandpa be there?
Stan: Yeah...
Cartman: Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.
Chef: Hello there children.
Stan: Hey Chef.
Chef: How's it goin'?
Stan: Bad.
Chef: Why bad?
Stan: Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa?
Chef: You can't kill my grandpa Stan, he's already passed on.
Stan: No, I mean, kill my grandpa.
Chef: No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.
Stan: See, I told you dude.
Kyle: Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
Cartman: Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?
Chef: I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
Stan: What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
Sheila: And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean.
Terrance: Hey Phillip, guess what?
Phillip: What?
Terrance: Fart.
Sheila: Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny.
Randy: Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh.
Sheila: Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...
Mr. Garrison: Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters.
Townsman: Ha ha, green apple splatters.
Grandpa: Uhhhh.
Stan: Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
Grandpa: Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet.
Stan: No grandpa, I'll get in trouble.
Grandpa: Kill me, God dammit!
Stan: No, I can't even kill a deer.
Grandpa: Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?
Cartman: I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
Grandpa: Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch.
Cartman: What!
Grandpa: That's right.
Stan: Grandpa!
Grandpa: And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too.
Cartman: Hey!
Grandpa: Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma.
Cartman: You piece of crap! I'll kill you!
Grandpa: That's the spirit Tubby.
Stan: Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
Cartman: Don't talk about my mom like that!
Stan: We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
Grandpa: I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?
Cartman: Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!
Stan: Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.
Cartman: Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.
Stan: I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die.
Kyle: I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.
Stan: Hey, yeah!
TV Announcer: And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access.
Jesus: Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace.
Jesus: First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'.
Caller: Yeah, is this Jesus?
Jesus: Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback.
Caller: Oh, sorry.
Caller: Uh, this is Martin...
Jesus: Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know.
Martin: How the hell'd you know that?
Jesus: Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?
Martin: Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and-
Jesus: Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance.
Martin: Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus.
Jesus: Next caller, you're on the air.
Stan: Jesus?
Jesus: Yes my son?
Stan: Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
Jesus: My son...
Stan: Yes?
Jesus: I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.
Jesus: Next caller.
Stan: Goddammit!
Jesus: I heard that.
Stan: What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Cartman: Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!
Kyle: Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?
Stan: Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole!
Cartman: Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.
Kyle: Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Cartman: Oh, biiitch.
Cartman: Yourmomis--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.
TV Announcer: And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
Terrance: Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans.
Phillip: Oho yeah, I love beans.
Cartman: Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.
Grandpa: Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa please?
Stan: Okay grandpa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
Terrance: Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.
Phillip: Well, don't fart on me Terrance.
Cartman: Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.
Kenny: (Oh my God!)
Cartman: Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny.
Phillip: You're such an asshole, Terrance.
Terrance: Haha, that I am!
Kenny: (Ow!)
Cartman: Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.
Shelly: Jesus! What the hell are you doing?
Stan: We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
Shelly: No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa?!
Grandpa: Tug - a - little harder, Billy.
Stan: Aaah!!
Grandpa: Uh, ow.
Shelly: You little jerk!
Shelly: You were trying to kill grandpa! I'm telling mom!
Grandpa: Dammit! I was so close.
TV Announcer: Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to viciously murder an innocent grandfather.
Talk Show Host: Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards?
Stan: We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
Talk Show Host: Terrance & Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame.
Sheila: These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!
Crowd: Woooo!
Townsman: Huh? Oh god! Oh god!
Sheila: We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come!
Sheila: We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!
Sheila: We want more quality television, like Full House.
Randy: Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison: No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me.
Randy: Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.
Mayor McDaniels: I just had a brown baby boy.
Stan: Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around.
Kyle: Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.
All: Whoopeee!
Grandpa: Come here Billy, I want to show you something.
Stan: Aww, do I have to?
Grandpa: Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me...
Grandpa: ...is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa.
Stan: Hey, what are you doing?!
Kyle: What are they doing in there?
Cartman: I don't know.
Grandpa: Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready Billy?
Stan: Uh, I guess.
Stan: Okay, you, you can let me out now.
Grandpa: Not just yet.
Stan: Let me out grandpa!
Stan: I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time.
Grandpa: That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa.
Stan: Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
Grandpa: So now will you kill me Billy?
Stan: Sure I will grandpa, I will.
Liane: Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.
Sheila: It'll work, it has to.
Townsman: Look! It's the president of the network.
John Warzog: Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warzog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network.
John Warzog: Fuck you.
John Warzog: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there.
Sheila: Hey, you will not get away with this!
Sheila: That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'.
Liane: Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?
Sheila: Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?
Kyle: Yep, all done.
Stan: 'Kay, come on guys.
Cartman: Why don't we just shoot him?
Stan: You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
Kyle: Yeah, stupid!
Grandpa: That's good Billy, a little higher now.
Cow: Moooo!
Sheila: The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?
Sheila: Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!
Sheila: We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes.
Stan: Are you ready grandpa?
Grandpa: Does the pope crap in the woods?
Police Radio: 7 Mary 5, code 6 - 105 North Avenue 52.
Cow: Mooo!
Officer Barbrady: Carry on.
Stan: Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you.
Grandpa: Uhh, cut the damn rope already!
Stan: What is that?!
Kyle: Well, it, it looks like...
All: Death!
Death: Mrrrrr!
Grandpa: It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.
Grandpa: Come on, let's go.
Grandpa: What the...?
Stan: Hey, he's coming towards us.
Kyle: Why is Death coming after us?
Death: Mrrr.
Kids: Ahhh!
Cartman: Aaaah, runrunruuun!
Death: Mrrr.
Kyle: What are we gonna do?
Death: Mooorrrr!
Newscaster: As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors.
Sheila: Here Carol, I think it's your boy.
Sharon: Oh thanks. What is it Stanley-hon, did you break something?
Stan: Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
Sharon: Stanley, honey, you need to leave mommy alone, I'm doing something very, very important for your little well-being there.
Stan: Yeah, but, mom!
Sharon: Here honey, talk to your father.
Randy: Did you turn the heat down?
Stan: Dad, Death is coming!
Randy: Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather.
Death: Mrrrr!
Stan: Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
Kyle: Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
Kenny: (You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)
Kyle: Totally dude.
Stan: Good point man.
Death: Mrrrr!
Stan: Ahhhh!
Kyle: Quick, jump through the window.
Cartman: Ehh, eh, ehhhh!
Death: Mrrrr!
Kids: Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!
Grandpa: Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
Kids: Aaaah!
Kyle: Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Grandpa: Come over here you son of a whore!
Phillip: Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?
Terrance: Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?
Phillip: Oh, you farted.
Terrance: Ohho God.
Terrance: Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?
Phillip: No Terrance, why don't you tell me?
Terrance: Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!
Phillip: Oh, there's one.
Newscaster: Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is...
Newscaster: Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement!
Townsman: Wait, wait.
John Warzog: Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked.
John Warzog: Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Sommers.
John Warzog: Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you!
Townsman: Huh, oh no!
Sheila: At last, now we can return to normality.
Terrance: Hey Phillip.
Phillip: Yes Terrance?
Terrance: Is there a penny stuck in my butt?
Phillip: Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.
Cartman: Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on.
TV Announcer: We interrupt this program to bring you loud static.
Death: Mrrrrr!
Kids: Ahhh!
Kyle: Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!
Stan: Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
Grandpa: Hey, you were supposed to kill me!
Death: Mrrr.
Grandpa: That's not fair, Goddammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it.
Stan: Whoa!
Great-Great-Grandpa: Billllyyyy...
Grandpa: Grandpa?
Great-Great-Grandpa: That's right, Billy.
Grandpa: My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?
Great-Great-Grandpa: I asked you to kill me Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo.
Grandpa: Limbo?
Great-Great-Grandpa: I was wrong to put you in that position Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes.
Grandpa: But I've been waiting for 25 years.
Great-Great-Grandpa: Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes...
Stan: Come on you guys, let's go home.
Sheila: Here they are!
Randy: Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.
Stan: What do you mean?
Sharon: We got Terrance & Phillip taken off the air.
Cartman: You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!
Sheila: But look what they put on.
TV Announcer: And now back to She's the Sheriff.
Cartman: Ohhh, God, No!
Suzanne Somers: You are the one behind all these shenanigans.
Dude: Yeah, well you're the stupid ho that started it.
Sheila: What did he say?
Suzanne: Up yours, butt-munch.
Sheila: Whatwhatwhaaat!!!
Sheila: Come on everybody, back to New York!
Kyle: Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?
Stan: I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
Cartman: My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
Kyle: Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?
Stan: Cool!
Cartman: Yeah!
Stan: What are you doing grandpa?
Grandpa: I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?
Stan: That's my silly grandpa.
Comrade 2: Graaah.
Comrade 1: Ayyy!
Stan: Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Kyle: You bastards!
Cartman: What the hell is that thing?
Kyle: It looks like a UFO.
Cartman: There's no such thing as UFOs.
Paramedic: Let's get 'im to the morgue.
Cartman: Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.
Kyle: Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.
Stan: Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready.
Mortician: You know, I think death is least funny when it happens to a child.
Marty: Oh, yes, I know what you mean.
Mortician: Marty, do you have to put that stuff on everything?
Marty: I don't know, it ju- it just makes everything taste so...English.
Mortician: Well, let's let him drain.
Mortician: ...So then the necrophiliac says, "If this ain't a cadaver then I-"
Mortician: Hey!
Marty: Aaah!
Marty: God damn! That little turd bit me!
Mortician: Me too!
Kyle: Ha ha, you look like a pansy.
Stan: Shut up Kyle!
Kyle: What uh, what are you supposed to be?
Stan: I'm Raggedy Andy.
Kyle: Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
Stan: Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
Kyle: No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
Stan: Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
Kyle: Wow! Cool!
Cartman: Hey, dudes.
Kyle: Cartman! What kind of costume is that?
Cartman: It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.
Stan: Where'd you get that?
Cartman: My mom made it, isn't it cool?
Kyle: No it's not cool!
Cartman: What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?
Stan: No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat-ass!
Cartman: Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool.
Kyle: Hehe. Sissy.
Stan: I'll kick your ass, Kyle!
Cartman: Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off!
Stan: Hey look, Kenny's not dead.
Kyle: You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.
Stan: Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
Kyle: Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?
Cartman: Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.
Cartman: I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!
Cartman: I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!
Cartman: Poor piece of crap.
Ms. Crabtree: COME ON, WE'RE RUNNING LATE!
Stan: Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
Ms. Crabtree: WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
Stan: I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."
Ms. Crabtree: Oh, neither can I.
Mortician: What, what is it doc?
Doctor: Well, your- your temperature is only 55 degrees, you have no pulse, no heartbeat, and your, your eyes are all puffy and sticky.
Mortician: Oh no, you mean...
Doctor: Yeah, I'm afraid the two of you have - Pink Eye.
Doctor: I'd give you topical medicine, but I don't wanna touch ya.
Marty: Oh I'm so hungry, and all I can think about eating is, eh, brains!
Doctor: Yeah, well for God sake don't touch your eyes. I'll prescribe some antibiotics.
Kyle: Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous...
Stan: Whoa, dude!
Kyle: Everyone came as Chewbacca?!
Mr. Garrison: It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle.
Mr. Hat: Roar.
Kyle: Dammit!
Stan: Wendy?
Wendy: Hi, Stan.
Stan: You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
Wendy: Yeahhh?
Stan: We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
Wendy: I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.
Stan: You what?!
Wendy: I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca.
Bill: Heheh. Heheh.
Fosse: Hey Stan, you look almost pretty enough to kiss.
Bill: Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend? Huhuh.
Fosse: Yehaha.
Bill: Huhuh.
Cartman: There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
Kyle: Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
Cartman: You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
Kyle: Wookies don't live on Endor!
Kyle: Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Cartman: What?! What did you say?
Mr. Garrison: Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats. Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel-
Wendy: Eww.
Mr. Garrison: Is there a problem Kenny?
Mr. Garrison: Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay?
Kyle: I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
Liane: Hello there!
Zombie: Uuuhh.
Liane: Happy Halloween!
Zombie Mortician: Must eat brains.
Passer-by: Aaargh!!! Oh my God!!!
Kyle: I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
Kyle: Aren't you hungry Kenny?
Stan: He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
Chef: Hello children.
Kyle, Stan: Hey Chef.
Chef: What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
Cartman: Eating Kenny's pudding.
Principal Victoria: Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef.
Chef: Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
Principal Victoria: Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?
Principal Victoria: Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!
Principal Victoria: Eric, God bless it, what do you think you're doing?!
Cartman: Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.
Cartman: That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.
Principal Victoria: Where did you get that costume, young man?!
Cartman: My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!
Principal Victoria: Sshh! Oh, God bless America.
Principal Victoria: You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.
Cartman: Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o.
Clyde: Owww, you bit my arm!
Principal Victoria: Watch the video Eric.
Narrator: Adolph Hitler was a very, very naughty man.
Adolf Hitler: Schnell ach. Lovental bros lieben. Alle Menschen werden Brder. Doktor Stalin? Alarm! Menchoss? Zellan vei zamboa-
Cartman: Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!
Puffy the Bear: So remember kids, dressing like Hitler in school isn't cool!
Principal Victoria: Now, do you have any questions?
Principal Victoria: You must remove that costume, immediately!
Cartman: I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.
Principal Victoria: Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now.
Principal Victoria: Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?
Principal Victoria: Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man.
Jogger: Ho, looks like they got a touch of that pink eye that's going around.
Cartman: Boo! I'm a ghost.
Stan: Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
Cartman: Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.
Chef: Hello, children.
Cartman: Hey Chef.
Chef: Aaaaah!
Cartman: Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?
Stan: Hey, where's Kyle?
Kyle: Check this out!
Stan: Whoa, dude!
Cartman: What is that?
Kyle: I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
Mr. Garrison: Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes.
Mr. Garrison: Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers.
Cartman: Who?
Kyle: Dude, I thought she was dead.
Stan: Yeah, me too.
Mr. Garrison: Thank you Miss Yothers. Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume.
Mr. Garrison: ...And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume!
Kyle: What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers!
Stan: Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
Wendy: Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.
Stan: I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe.
Mr. Garrison: That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing.
Clyde: Brainnns. Ahh.
Mr. Garrison: Wait your turn Clyde.
Johnson: Uuuuuuuuuuuuuhh!
Chef: Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?
Johnson: Piiink eyyye.
Chef: Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye!
Tom: ...And the President responded to the incident by saying, quote, "Screw those Commie bastards, and screw their little wussy space station."
Tom: In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a bikini.
Midget: Thanks Tom, already more than half the townspeople here in South Park have been infected with the pink eye virus.
Midget: Symptoms include a complete loss of heart functions, blood pressure, lung activity, and of course, sticky puffy eyes.
Chef: Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
Cartman: Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.
Stan: I bet I get more candy than you dude.
Cartman: Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.
Stan: No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
Cartman: Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking.
Stan: Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Cartman: God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!
Kyle: Hey dudes.
Stan: Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
Cartman: Check.
Stan: Plastic pumpkin pails...
Kyle: Check.
Stan: Taser...
Kyle: What's that?
Stan: For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
Cartman: Yeah, granola pisses me off.
Kyle, Stan: Hey Kenny.
Cartman: Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.
Kyle: You still didn't get a costume Kenny?
Cartman: Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.
Cartman: I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!
Cartman: I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.
Wendy: Hi guys.
Cartman: Hi Wendy.
Wendy: Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi.
Cartman: You what?! Are you insane?!
Wendy: Let's go trick-or-treats.
Stan: I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
Wendy: Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad.
Cartman: How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
Stan: Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!
Wendy: But Stan!
Stan: No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!
Wendy: AAAAAAAAAAAH!
Chef: Doctor!
Doctor: Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right?
Chef: No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.
Doctor: What the hell are you talking about?
Chef: Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!
Doctor: Chef, Ah- I think maybe the pink eye has made you a little delirious. Le- let me give you some, some topical cream.
Chef: Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr!
Mr. Torres: Aaah!
Doctor: Uhh, Mr. Torres was here for a routine check-up Chef.
Chef: Oh, sorry.
Chef: But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here.
Doctor: Hey hey, now, now, there, there have been a lot of incredible advances in topical creams over the last few years.
Chef: Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?
Doctor: Well, uh, i- it was the mortician and his assistant at the morgue, yeah.
Chef: Aaaaaaaaaah!
Doctor: Now, now, now let's, let's form a line, I've got enough topical cream for everybody.
Doctor: Ahh!
The Boys: Trick-or-treat!
Elderly Woman: Ohh, how cute.
Elderly Woman: Aaah!
Stan: Dude, Kenny!
Elderly Woman: Oh, My God! Call 911, call 911!
Cartman: Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.
Elderly Woman: Call 911!
Stan: Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.
Cartman: You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!
Chef: Mayor, we've got a big problem.
Mayor McDaniels: Ugh!
Mayor McDaniels: Why, why Chef. What a surprise!
Officer Barbrady: You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.
Chef: Actually, uh-
Mayor: Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia.
Chef: I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
Mayor McDaniels: You mean, Tina Yothers?
Chef: No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!
Officer Barbrady: Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle?
Mayor McDaniels: Well, let's get back to it.
Officer Barbrady: Righty-o.
The Boys: Trick-or-treat.
Dude: Hope you kids like chocolate-peanut butter-cream puffies.
Dude: Aaah!
Dude: Get it off! Get it off me!! Gaaah!
Cartman: Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
Stan: Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
Somebody: Oh, God!
The Boys: Trick-or-treat.
Cartman: Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.
Cartman: One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
Female: Oh my God!
Female: Oh my God!
Female: Nooo!
The Boys: Trick-or-t-Aaah!
Chef: Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!
The Boys: Hey, Chef, trick-
Stan, Kyle: Chef! No!
Cartman: Can we have some candy now please?!
Chef: Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!
Cartman: I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!
Chef: Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha!
Stan: What are you talking about Chef?
Chef: Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
Kyle: Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.
Chef: Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.
Stan: Oh my God, that means...
Kyle: If everyone is turned into zombies...
Cartman: Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!
Cartman: Aaah!
Kyle: Chef, you've gotta help us!
Chef: I'm working on it children.
Stan: Wait, where are we going?
Chef: The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue.
Cartman: It was Kyle.
Stan: I don't know about this Chef.
Kyle: Yeah, I'm scared.
Cartman: Remember candy, focus on the candy.
Stan: What are we doing here Chef?
Chef: Just look for anything suspicious.
Kyle: I found it! I found it!
Stan: What?
Kyle: See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
Cartman: Eh, shit...
Stan: We told you dude.
Cartman: You guys, shit...
Chef: You better let me take that Kyle.
Stan: Hey Chef. Look
Chef: I gotta call this hotline number children.
Pip: Piiink eye!
Cartman: It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
Pip: Aaah!
Chef: Look out children!
Zombie: Ow, ooh, ow, gowuh-
Stan: Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef?
Kyle: Chef!!!
Stan: Let's get out of here!
Chef: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Stan: We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
Cartman: Hey, there's a pay phone!
Stan: You call the number Kyle.
Kyle: But the zombies are coming!
Stan: We'll hold 'em off.
Hotline Voice: Welcome to the Worcestershire Sauce customer service hotline. For Worcestershire sauce recipes please press 1 followed by the pound sign. For Worcestershire sauce product placement, please press 2. If Worcestershire sauce has been used as embalming, please pr...
Cartman: Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!
Cartman: Aaah, kew!
Stan: Sweet!
Hotline Voice: Worcestershire sauce emergency hotline, this call might be monitored to ensure you the highest quality service, how may I help you?
Kyle: There's a bunch of zombies here!
Hotline Voice: Please hold.
Stan: Wendy?
Wendy: Aaahahah!
Cartman: Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!
Stan: I know, but uh-... but...
Cartman: Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
Stan: Hey, yeah!
Hotline Voice: For regular sauce, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you do not just go out and start decapitating zombies left and right. Do you understand? Do not start decapitating zombies left and right!
Kyle: Uh, okay. Then what?
Wendy: Aaahh.
Cartman: Kill her Stan!
Hotline Voice: All you have to do is kill the original zombie. The one that started the whole mess. Once you kill the original zombie, all the others zombies will turn back to normal.
Kyle: Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!
Hotline Voice: We realize you have a choice in worcestershire sauces, we are delighted that...
Kyle: Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.
Wendy: Aaah!
Stan: I, I can't.
Wendy: Aaah!
Kyle: Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
Wendy: Oh, what happened? Stan?
Stan: Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
Kyle: It's working! They're turning back to normal.
Chef: You did it children!
Cartman: Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!
Wendy: I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.
Stan: That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
Wendy: Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.
Wendy: Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross!
Stan: Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.
Kyle: Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.
Stan: Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
Cartman: Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way.
Stan: You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
Kyle: ...No, dude, that's Christmas.
Stan: Oh, then, what's Halloween about?
Kyle: Costumes and candy.
Stan: Oh.
Cartman: Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.
Kyle: We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
Stan: Yeah.
Cartman: Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.
Stan: Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
Cartman: Lehh, eh, screw you guys!
Kenny: (Heeeeyyyy, kick ass.)
Kenny: (Ow!)
Stan: That was awesome!
Kyle: Yeah!
Liane: Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?
Cartman: Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
Liane: Sure hon.
Phillip: Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.
Terrance: It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here.
Phillip: AAAAAH!
Phillip: Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
Cartman: Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
TV Announcer: Coming up next on the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, Phillip farts on Terrance, and laughs.
Kyle: Oh, cool.
TV Announcer: And now a word from our sponsor.
Sally Struthers: Here in the heart of Africa children are dying. Not from disease or war, but from hunger. I'm Sally Struthers. These children are in desperate need, and only you can help.
Stan: Hey, who's that fat chick?
Stan: Oh.
Sally Struthers: You see, here, in the middle of Africa, food is extremely scarce.
Kyle: Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.
Cartman: Yeah, HEY!
Cartman: That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?
Sally Struthers: Sponsor now and we'll also send you this Teiko digital sports watch as a free gift.
Cartman: KICK ASS!!
Stan: SWEET!
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Stan: I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.
Kyle: Did they say if it's waterproof?
Stan: Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?
Stan: Oh.
Kyle: What did she say?
Stan: Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.
Kyle: Ass-rammer.
Stan: Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Cartman: When do we get the sports watch?
Stan: Just a second fat-ass!
Cartman: You vas-deferens!
Kenny: (Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)
Stan: Oh.
Kyle: Ask her if we get the watch right away.
Stan: Do we get the sports watch right away?
Stan: She says we do.
All: Cool.
Cartman: I get to wear it first, you guys.
Kyle: I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
Cartman: Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.
Mr. Garrison: Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?
Mr. Garrison: Yes, Eric?
Cartman: When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
Mr. Garrison: Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
Mr. Garrison: A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.
Stan: You mean, like Kenny?
Mr. Garrison: Exactly.
Cartman: Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
Mr. Garrison: Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.
Cartman: I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!
Wendy: Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
Cartman: Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!
Cartman: Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!
Mr. Garrison: Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat: That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?
Clyde: Aaaah!
Mr. Garrison: What the hell is going on?!
Clyde: Aaaah!
Mr. Garrison: Well, you don't see that everyday.
Mayor McDaniels: Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor.
Aide 2: It should be something festive.
Mephesto: Mayor, we've got a very big problem.
Mayor McDaniels: Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?
Mephesto: Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving.
Mephesto: You know, to provide food for the needy.
Mephesto: Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off.
Mayor McDaniels: Naturally.
Mayor McDaniels: Oh, do go on.
Mephesto: We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short.
Mayor McDaniels: You were saying?
Mephesto: They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil.
Mephesto: Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.
Everybody: Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?
Cartman: I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?
Stan: Damn.
Kyle: Hey, look you guys.
Terrance: I sure am cold, Phillip.
Phillip: Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.
Terrance: Gosh, I hope we don't starve.
Phillip: Ah, a squeaker!
Kyle: The digital sports watch is here.
Cartman: What the hell?
Stan: Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.
Kyle: Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.
Stan: Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
Kyle: Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.
Kyle: Whoa! That was cool.
Stan: Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
Kyle: What's your name dude?
Kid: Mabin.
Stan: I think he said his name is Marvin.
Cartman: Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.
Kyle: Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
Cartman: Hey mooom?
Liane: Yes hon?
Cartman: We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?
Liane: Sure, hon.
Cartman: Sweet.
Stan: Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.
Kyle: Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.
Kyle: Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
Cartman: Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
Kyle: Totally.
Cartman: Ahh!
Woman: Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.
Man: Not as beautiful as you.
Man: Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys.
Woman: Oohh, they're so beautiful.
Man: Not as beautiful as you.
Woman: Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer.
Man: Not as beautiful as-
Stan: This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
Cartman: Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.
Cartman: Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?
Cartman: You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
Marvin: Ap-ee-tizer.
Cartman: Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers.
Cartman: Oh yeah, you're right.
Mr. Garrison: Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive.
Mr. Garrison: And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?
Mr. Garrison: Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.
Stan: Yeah, yeah, we do!
Cartman: Yeah, that's right.
Kyle: We do!
Mr. Garrison: All right boys, show us what you've brought.
Kyle: This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin.
Stan: He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.
Cartman: No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.
Cartman: No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!
Stan: He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
Mr. Garrison: The sports watch from the commercial?
Kyle: Yeah, that one.
Bebe: I want a Starvin' Marvin.
Clyde: Me too.
Pip: Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.
Class: Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me.
Mr. Garrison: Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.
Kyle: Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.
Principal Victoria: Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.
Principal Victoria: Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Stan: No.
Principal Victoria: You can't care for this child!
Principal Victoria: Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park.
Stan: So why can't he live here now?
Principal Victoria: Because he can't!
Kyle: Because why?
Principal Victoria: Because eight-year olds can't be parents!
Principal Victoria: I send my five dollars a month, see?
Stan: This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.
Cartman: Oh well, back to the poor country with you.
Cartman: B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.
Mephesto: I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.
Chef: Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.
Mephesto: Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.
Chef: Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.
Mephesto: Oh, whoops.
Mephesto: Now tell me what you see.
Chef: Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.
Mephesto: Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing.
Chef: What does it mean?
Mephesto: Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world.
Chef: Oh, fudge!
Chef: Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.
Mephesto: Sure.
Agent 1: Hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch.
Cartman: Hey, hey, what's going on?!
Cartman: Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!
Agent 1: Here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up.
Cartman: Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!
Marvin: Sweet.
Mayor McDaniels: So how does this thing work?
Mayor McDaniels: POVVVV?
Aide: Poverty stricken citizen.
Mayor McDaniels: Ohhoho, brilliant.
Mayor McDaniels: Daah!! What the hell is this!!
Aide: I don't know mayor, I don't think it's listed on the program.
Mephesto: They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.
Chef: It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!
Chef: Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!
Kyle: Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
Mayor McDaniels: OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD!
Terrance: Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?
Phillip: Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon.
Terrance: Huh, eh,
Terrance: wait wait wait.
Terrance: Eh, eh.
Terrance: Here it comes, ehhhh.
Terrance: Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!
Phillip: Aaaah.
Phillip: I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf.
Terrance: I spattered his face!
Phillip: Now he's a smelly Indian.
Sally Struthers: Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support.
Cartman: Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!
Sally Struthers: So please, call and adopt a child today.
Cartman: I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
Liane: You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?
Liane: Okay.
Marvin: Sweet.
Cartman: Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.
Cartman: Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?
Cartman: Well, screw you too!
Cartman: What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!
Mayor McDaniels: All right everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor, haa.
Stan: Hey, where's Cartman?
Kyle: I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin?
Mayor McDaniels: Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab.
Mayor McDaniels: Come on, hurry up.
Mrs. McCormick: Grab a lot son.
Mayor McDaniels: Have a happy Thanksgiving! Let 'er rip!
Mayor McDaniels: Cuhome on, grab those cans little boy!
Stan, Kyle: Come on, Kenny!
Stuart McCormick: Come on, son!
Mayor McDaniels: Now, let's see all the goodies you're going to take home to your family.
Chef: What the-?!
Stan: Dude, the mutant turkeys are back!
Officer Barbrady: Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos.
Mephesto: I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen.
Chef: Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...
Mephesto: That's not important right now.
Chef: No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
Mayor McDaniels: Chef, the turkeys!
Chef: Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!
Chef: We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
Cartman: Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.
Cartman: Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!
Cartman: I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
Red Cross Dude: Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We ran out of funding.
Cartman: What?!
Red Cross Dude: We just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up.
Cartman: But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
Red Cross Dude: Sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. Here, have a Teiko sports watch.
Cartman: WEEEEEEAK!!!
Mayor McDaniels: People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys.
Townsperson 1: There's too many of them.
Mayor McDaniels: Come on! Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?!
Townsperson 2: We can't stop them.
Chef: Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!
Crowd: Wooo, yeahhh, woo.
Leader Turkey: Gobble, gobble. Gobble gobble. Gob, gobble. Gob, gob, gob, Gobble!!
Kyle: Here you go turkeys!
Mayor McDaniels: Does my hair look okay?
Cartman: Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...
Cartman: I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.
Cartman: Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.
Cartman: Huh, I wonder what's in here?
Cartman: SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!
Cartman: Sally Struthers?!
Sally Struthers: Who the hell are you?!
Cartman: Gimme that cake!
Sally Struthers: NOO! You can't have any!
Cartman: No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!
Cartman: You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!!
Sally Struthers: Uh oh.
Chef: Stay close children.
Stan, Kyle, Kenny: Yeaaa!
Kenny: (O-Oh.)
Stan: Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle: You bastards!
Jimbo: The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned.
Stan: We did it!!
Mephesto: My God, what have we done?
Chef: We've saved Thanksgiving!
Mephesto: But all those poor turkeys, theh- they're all dead.
Chef: Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.
Mephesto: As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should-
Chef: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Agent 2: Excuse me sir, we're looking for a little starving Ethiopian boy who was accidentally delivered to South Park instead of a Teiko sports watch.
Agent 1: Have you seen anyone fitting this description.
Officer Barbrady: Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister.
Agent 1: There you are. Are you ready to go home now?
Stan: Wow, it sucks he has to leave.
Stan: You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.
Stan: But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
Kyle: Yeah.
Kyle: And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
Red Cross Chick: We're terribly sorry about the mix-up little boy. We'll get you back home immediately.
Cartman: That's right you will, God-Damnit.
Cartman: Move it POVs, I'm an American!
Ethiopian: A baba, gluck gluck bababab ga.
Marvin: Baba gook gook ba.
Sally Struthers: (What are you doing? Let me off of here!)
Stuart: Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us, and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen.
Mrs. McCormick: Amen.
Mrs. McCormick: Does anybody have a can opener?
Stuart: God Damn-it.
Stan: Lights, please.
Kyle: Come on, Mary! Push!
Wendy: Aaaah!
Kyle: I can see its head!
Wendy: UUuuhh-UUuuhh.
Kyle: It's a boy!
Cartman: Oohhhh!
Mr. Garrison: Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that? You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head. What kind of sick weirdo are you?
Kyle: ...Sorry.
Mr. Garrison: And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains.
Wendy: Okay.
Sheila: Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Mr. Garrison: ...So?
Sheila: So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?
Mr. Garrison: Because it's Christmas???
Mr. Garrison: Oh god, you're not gonna lay that Hanukkah crap on me, are you?
Cartman: Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
Kyle: Shut up, fat boy!
Cartman: I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.
Stan: Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?
Mr. Garrison: Oh-kay! Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus?
Sheila: How about the dreidel song, bubbe?
Kyle: I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...
Mr. Garrison: The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go?
Cartman: What the hell is Christmas Poo?
Sheila: Kyle, that is enough!
Mr. Garrison: See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan.
Sheila: Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison.
Mr. Garrison: Oh wait wait wait. I'm sorry. Was it the pagan remark?
Wendy: You guys, look! It's snowing!
Stan: Whoa, Christmas snow!
Wendy: Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue.
Wendy: It's fun.
Kenny: P'tooui.
Stan: That was sick, dude!
Cartman: Hey!
Cartman: What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
Kyle: We can, too!
Stan: ...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
Kyle: Officer Barbrady!
Officer Barbrady: What?
Kyle: Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
Officer Barbrady: Yyess.
Kyle: Damnit!
Stan: Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
Cartman: Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
Kyle: No. But I get Hanukkah presents for eight days.
Cartman: Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
Stan: We'll catch up with you later, Kyle.
Kyle: Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
Stan: Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?
Kyle: Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Cartman: Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now.
Cartman: You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle.
Stan: See you around, dude.
Mayor McDaniels: Ahem. Okay everybody, settle down.
Some men: No! Wrong!
Kyle: What's going on, you guys?
Stan: The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's really sweet.
Sheila: That isn't all, Mayor! The school play is doing a Nativity scene! It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!
Crowd: Yeah! Yeah!
Cartman: Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!
Kyle: Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Woman: Hallelujah!
Man: Amen!
Man 1: Raah!
Man 2: Give me a break!
Uncle Jimbo: And I'm sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids. If you don't want to spill your coffee, you shouldn't be driving with it.
Crowd: Yeah! Yeah!
Assistant 1: Oooo, brilliant idea, Mayor!
Kyle: Hey! How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?
Mayor McDaniels: Ex-cuse me?
Kyle: Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Sheila: Kyle! Sshhh!
Kenny: (Kyle's crazy!)
Stan: Yeah.
Sheila: Okay, Kyle, we're leaving right nowww.
Kyle: Wait...
Mayor McDaniels: Anyway, I'll put together a crack team of my best workers to make sure this'll be the most non-offensive Christmas ever - to any religious or minority group of any kind. Are there any other suggestions?
Mayor McDaniels: Yes, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison: Can we get rid of all the Mexicans?
Mayor McDaniels: No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid of all the Mexicans.
Mr. Garrison: Rats!
Gerald Broflovski: It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!
Sheila: Your father's right, Kyle.
Gerald: Sheila, let me handle this. Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!
Sheila: Listen to your father, Kyle.
Gerald: Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'.
Kyle: But dad, he always sh...
Gerald: Say it!
Kyle: There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
Gerald: Again!
Kyle: There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
Sheila: This is for your own good, bubbe.
Gerald: Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed! You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!
Gerald: What did you say?!
Kyle: I said Ike's on fire!
Ike: Oh oh. On flame? Oh oh. On flame?
Sheila: Oh my God!
Kyle: It isn't fair! I don't want to be an outcast!
Voice: Kyle.
Kyle: I'm not hearing that.
Voice: Kyle.
Kyle: Mr. Hankey?
Mr. Hankey: Howwwwdy-hoooo.
Mr. Hankey: Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell.
Mr. Hankey: You know something, Kyle? You smell an awful lot like flowers.
Kyle: I said go away! My father said you aren't real.
Mr. Hankey: Not real? Well shucks. If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song?
Kyle: Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.
Gerald: Kyle, what are you doing in there?
Kyle: Nothing.
Gerald: Open this door!
Kyle: Mr. Hankey, come here.
Gerald: KYLE!
Kyle: Say something, Mr. Hankey!
Gerald: Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!
Sheila: Whatwhatwhaaat?! Me?!
Mr. Hankey: Howdy-ho!
Kyle: Mr. Hankey! Where the hell did you go?
Mr. Hankey: You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold.
Kyle: Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.
Mr. Hankey: Aw, gee, that's too bad.
Kyle: Hey! How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
Mr. Hankey: Say, that sounds like a swell idea. We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas.
Kyle: Yeah! We'll show them!
Mayor McDaniels: Okay, people, we've got to turn this place around! Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group!
Uncle Jimbo: Is mistletoe offensive?
Mayor McDaniels: Is anyone offended by mistletoe?
Mayor McDaniels: Lose the mistletoe!
Stan: You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
Stan: 'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
Stan: What's that?
Kyle: Hello, everybodyyy.
Stan: What's in the box, dude?
Kyle: It's a surprise.
Cartman: Let me see!
Kyle: O-Okay. But don't scare him...
Cartman: Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
Kenny: (That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)
Kyle: Wait! You guys! He's alive!
Stan: Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
Kyle: Come on, dance! Daaance! Dance, damn you!!
Researcher: Now this is very simple. I'm going to say words and the computer will measure how offended you are by them. In this way we can find out which words are least offensive for use in the holiday season. Are we ready?
Researcher: Here we go: Christ
Researcher: Hm. Okay. Cherub.
Researcher: Hm... Camel
Researcher: Hm. Sad.
Researcher: Stupid Wop Dago.
Researcher: Bench...
Mr. Garrison: Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?
Janitor 2: Mayor's orders.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play. The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus.
Kyle: Shut up, Cartman!
Mr. Garrison: So does anybody know any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs.
Mr. Garrison: Yes, Eric?
Cartman: How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.
Kyle: I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Kyle: Shut up, Cartman!
Mr. Hankey: Howdy-ho!
Mr. Hankey: Golly, that isn't very nice.
Mr. Hankey: I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.
Kyle: Mr. Hankey, no!
Mr. Hankey: Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!!
Mr. Garrison: What the...
Cartman: Gross, Kyle!
Mr. Garrison: Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doo-doo at Eric?
Kyle: Uuuuuuhh...
Cartman: YOU SICK BASTARD!
Mr. Mackey, Jr.: Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?
Mr. Mackey: Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia.
Kyle: What's that?
Mr. Mackey: Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle.
Mr. Mackey: Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?
Kyle: Wull, not on purpose.
Mr. Mackey: So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all. Do the other kids make fun of ya?
Kyle: Well, sometimes...
Mr. Mackey: And that must make you mad.
Kyle: Well sure.
Kyle: No, dude!
Mr. Mackey: Oh that's good. You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?
Kyle: But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...
Mr. Mackey: Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have.
Mr. Hankey: Kyle!
Mr. Hankey: Howdy-ho.
Mr. Mackey: Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, m'kay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand?
Mr. Mackey: To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac...
Mr. Mackey: Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey!
Students: Hhmm.
Mr. Garrison: ...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?
Mr. Garrison: Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous.
Mr. Garrison: Okay. Now let's practice our...
Mr. Mackey: No! Get away from me!
Kyle: Here. Just look more closely at it.
Mr. Mackey: No! Go away! Stan, you need to do something about your friend, m'kay. Get him out of here before he hurts anybody! M'kay?
Stan: Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
Nurse: Reason?
Kyle: I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.
Nurse: Any allergies?
Kyle: No.
Nurse: Jacket!
Cartman: Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah!
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children, does everyone have their leotards on?
Artsy Man: Good, it looks like they have taken the Christmas trees down.
His Date: Yes, and there's nothing Christian, either. This should be great!
Sheila: Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it.
MC: Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday...
Uncle Jimbo: Oh, come on!
Randy Marsh: I agree.
Mr. Garrison: Oh brother.
Mr. Garrison: Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?
Mr. Garrison: And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there.
Kenny: (Hunh?)
MC: Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday Experience. Before we bring out the kiddies for the play, here's a non-offensive, non-denominational holiday song by the school chef.
Stan: I wish Kyle was here. It just doesn't seem right without him.
Cartman: Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, kids, get ready to take your places.
MC: Thank you, Chef!
Kenny: (Phew!)
MC: And now, South Park Elementary presents the happy, non-offensive, non-denominational Christmas Play, with music and lyrics by New York minimalist composer, Philip Glass!
Voice-over: As I turn and look into the sun, the rays burn my eyes.
Voice-over: How like a turtle the sun looks.
Sheila: What the hell is this???
Sheila: This is horrible!!!
Father Maxi: This is the most God-awful piece of crap I've ever seen!!
Father Maxi: Yeah, it's because the Jews said it couldn't be Christian.
Elderly Tree Hugger: All you bastards ruined Christmas!
Gerald: Get him in the ribs!
Father Maxi: Oof.
Man in audience: Damn tree-hugger!
Stan: This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
Wendy: Yeah.
Chef: Say, where's Kyle?
Stan: We committed him.
Chef: What? Why?
Cartman: 'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
Stan: Huh?! O-oh.
Stan: This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
Chef: Well! You can believe in him now.
Woman: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH.
Stan: I believe.
Wendy: I believe in Mr. Hankey.
Mr. Hankey: Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!
Mr. Hankey: Howdy, folks. Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery.
Cartman, Stan: Whoa!!
Mr. Hankey: Howdy-ho, Chef!
Chef: Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!
Cartman: Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home!
Cartman: Talking poo is where I draw the line!
Mr. Hankey: What's all the ruckus?
Mr. Hankey: I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey!
Mr. Hankey: STOP FIGHTING!!
Mr. Hankey: Come on, gang, don't fight. You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, "Aw, the heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies".
Stan: Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Mr. Hankey: Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!
Kyle: Oh no, I'm not sane yet!
Mr. Hankey: I brought some friends with me.
Kyle: Friends?
Townsfolk: Merry Christmas, Kyle Broflovski!!!
Kyle: You mean you can see him? Ah-I'm not crazy?
Mr. Hankey: Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me. Bye-bye and Merry Christmas.
Cartman: Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you!
Santa Claus: Howdy-ho ho ho!
Stan: You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too.
Cartman: Yeah, something feels...unfinished.
Stan: Wh-what could it be?
Kenny: (Yee he hee!)
Cartman: Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
Kyle: What is this, Cartman?
Cartman: They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
Stan: Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
Cartman: That's right.
Stan: Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too.
Cartman: I shoved it up my ass!
Cartman: Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...
Cartman: No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.
Mr. Garrison: I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today.
Cartman: Eeeeeeh!
Damien Thorn: Damien!
Damien: The seventh layer of hell!
Mr. Garrison: Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama.
Damien: My arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father!
Mr. Garrison: Your father?
Damien: The Prince of Darkness!
Mr. Garrison: Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...
Cartman: Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?
Damien: Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...
Cartman: Byah. Oof!
Stan: Whoa, dude!
Kyle: Damn, what a freak!
Damien: Now feel the wrath - of the fallen angels! The plague of night is upon ye.
Mr. Garrison: Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes?
Stan: Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
Cartman: Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
Kyle: Yeah, that's weak!
Cartman: Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?
Stan: Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want.
Stan: Oh great, Green Mega Man it is.
Stan: Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
Cartman: Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!
Damien: Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!
Kyle: You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table!
Cartman: Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.
Cartman: Eeyy!
Pip: Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.
Damien: Then I will call you Pip.
Pip: Right-o.
Stan: Hey new kid!
Stan: Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
Kenny: (Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)
Damien: That does it! Woo-paah.
Stan: What the...?
Kyle: Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
Kenny: Quack-quack.
Cartman: Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
Chef: Hello there, children.
Stan: Hey, Chef.
Chef: How's it going?
Kyle: Bad.
Chef: Why bad?
Kyle: Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
Chef: What were we talking about again?
Damien: Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all!
Stan: Whoa!
Chef: Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker!
Kyle: We told you, dude.
Chef: We've got to do something, children!
Damien: Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus!
Stan, Kyle: Jesus?
Roland: Two minutes to air, Jesus.
Stan: Jesus, Jesus!
Jesus: Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show.
Stan: No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
Kyle: Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.
Kenny: Quack-quack.
Jesus: Wow. That's pretty heavy.
Stan: This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
Stan: Yeah.
Kyle: Yeah.
Jesus: So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One.
Jesus: Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.
Kyle: ... K.
Groundskeeper: Five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!
Red: Aaaaa Bebe!
Bebe: Our slide!
Damien: Feel my wrath!
Damien: I don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan!
Pip: Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely.
Jesus: Damien!
Damien: Aaah! Son of Stench! Cursed Ruler of the weak!
Damien: Your time on this earth is short. Soon, my father comes.
Jesus: Let him come then. I shall stop him!
Kyle: Ohh, dude!
Satan: Hic dominus ampullicus unum sum. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
Jimbo: What the hell's going on here?
Father Maxi: Look! It's that guy from the public access show!
Blonde: What's happening?
Chef: Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!
Chef: Not you, dammit!
Satan: Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
Damien: Jesus, my father says... he chooses you! He calls you out! Be here at this time tomorrow! Then the terms will be discussed!
Jimbo: Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie!
Stan: You're gonna fight Satan?
Jesus: This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.
Commercial: Who will win our souls?
Commercial: Our Savior and Lord?
Commercial: Or the Prince of Darkness?
Commercial: It's the final battle between Good and Evil.
Commercial: And it's only on Pay Per View! Jesus Versus Satan! Live, from the South Park Forum on Saturday. Call now to order, only $49.95.
Cartman: Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!
Kenny: Quack-quack.
Cartman: Cartman's birthday!
Kyle: We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
Cartman: You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
Stan: Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in.
Cartman: Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!
Father Maxi: When is Satan gonna show up?
Stan: Did the Devil show up yet?
Jesus: Not yet.
Kyle: Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?
Cartman: Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.
Jesus: Oh.
Jimbo: We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince.
Jesus: Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation.
Jesus: Behold. The Evil One approaches.
Mr. Garrison: Holy poop on a stick!
Satan: Puny Son of Jehovah! Prepare to enter thy House of Pain!
Satan: Son of God, I will smash thy face into small little bits!
Jesus: Oh - oh yeah??
Man in crowd: Damn.
Satan: I have such delightful horrors to unleash upon thee.
Jesus: Oh yeah??
Announcer: Satan weighs in at - 320 lbs, 4 oz.
Announcer: Jesus Christ weighs in at - 135 lbs., 1 oz.
Chef: Ooh crap.
Jesus: Aw, come on! I weigh more than that.
Satan: Let the new prince be decided on Saturday. First South Park, then the world.
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too.
Father Maxi: Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck.
Man 1: Change my bet!
Man 2: I'm betting on the Devil!
Jimbo: I wanna change my bet to Satan.
Ned: Me, too.
Mr. Garrison: Wai-wa I was here first.
Mr. Mackey: Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, m'kay?
Damien: Everybody hates me!
Mr. Mackey: Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is?
Damien: Because I'm the son of the Devil?
Mr. Mackey: Uhuh. That's a good start, why else?
Damien: Because I... burn them and kill them?
Clyde: I bet I can spit the most on him.
Bebe: Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair.
Pip: Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
Stan: Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'.
Damien: I apologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice.
Stan: Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
Kyle: Yeah. We're gonna call you Fart-boy from now on.
Stan: Bubye, Fart-boy.
Kyle: See ya.
Pip: Good day, Damien. How are you?
Damien: Those guys farted on me, and then called me-
Jesus: Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-
Chef: Oh ooh.
Jesus: I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.
Jesus: In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!
Father Maxi: You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!
Jesus: Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!
Father Maxi: Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus.
Jesus: I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.
Father Maxi: Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!
Mr. Garrison: Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too.
Jimbo: Yeah.
Father Maxi: What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, crazy.
Mr. Allen: He's so gay.
Mr. McDonald: Yeah.
Jesus: You're all a bunch of Judases!
Stan: Hey, Jesus.
Jesus: What are you doing out so late, kids?
Kyle: We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
Jesus: Oh. Kids, you believe I can beat Satan, right?
Stan: Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.
Kyle: Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
Jesus: No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?
Reporter 1: Satan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be?
Satan: I will crush him like a little bug!
Reporter 2: Satan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War?
Don King: Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring.
Cartman: You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
Stan: Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.
Jesus: No way, dude!
Stan: But you're his sparring partner, Chef.
Jesus: Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train.
Chef: Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
Chef: Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
Liane: Come on, kiddies. Eat more.
Cartman: Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
Chef: Yup! Here's your present, children.
Chef: Well, uh, nice party. Uh, see ya later.
Kyle: Hey, you just got here, Chef!
Chef: I know, but the fight is starting.
Stan: Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
Liane: Mmmmm.
Damien: I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.
Pip: Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.
Damien: The other kids have always hated you?
Michael Buffer: And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub!
Michael Buffer: Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet's get ready to rumbllllle!!
Referee: Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles.
Stan: Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.
Kyle: And neither were you, Pip!
Pip: Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-
Damien: Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party.
Pip: Aaaa!
Pip: Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Kyle: Wow!
Stan: Whoa, that was cool!
Kyle: Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
Kyle: It's a game, dude. It's really fun.
Kyle: They were all out of 'em dude!
Cartman: Aah! AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cartman: That's it! Party is over!
Cartman: Everybody go home!
Cartman: GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT!
Stan: Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!
Cartman: Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!
Damien: Wow. That kid has some emotional problems.
Stan: Aaanh, he does this all the time.
Pip: Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty.
Jesus: Oh!
Satan: Fight, dammit!
Jesus: It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.
Kyle: Uuuuh. Stan?
Kyle: Stan.
Stan: She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
Kyle: Stan!
Kyle: Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
Kyle: Yeah, dude!
Stan: Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.
Stan: You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'.
Jesus: ... Who said that?
Jesus: You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys!
Kyle: Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Kyle: Hmmm.
Satan: Ooooooh, you got me.
Referee: One... Two... Three...
Jimbo: No way! He barely touched him!
Referee: ... Seven... Eight.
Referee: ... Nine... Ten. You're out!
Stan, Kyle: Our Savior!
Michael Buffer: The winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!
Mr. Garrison: Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!
Jimbo: Yeah!
Satan: Fools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win?
Father Maxi: I don't believe this!
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, what a mean thing to do!
Mr. Garrison: Boy, did we get screwed.
Chef: Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?
Jimbo: Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!
Jimbo: Ih-it's comin' right for us!
Stan: Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
Kyle: You bastard!
Damien: Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you.
Stan: You're leaving already?
Damien: I have to. My dad's always on the move.
Stan: Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Kyle: Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
Stan: Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
Liane: More pie, hon?
Cartman: Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
Wendy: Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day.
Stan: I know.
Wendy: Maybe we should go on a cruise or something.
Stan: I can't afford a cruise, dude.
Stan: Shut up, Cartman!
Cartman: Oh man, I...
Wendy: -and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
Cartman: Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.
Principal Victoria: And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.
Principal Victoria: Yes, little boy?
Principal Victoria: ...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen.
Stan, Kyle: Whoa!
Kenny: (Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
Kenny: (Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
Principal Victoria: Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay.
Ms. Ellen: Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.
Ms. Ellen: Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,
Ms. Ellen: ...but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us.
Ms. Ellen: Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?
Ms. Ellen: Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.
Stan: Yeu-bluuuch.
Cartman: Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.
Stan: I'll kick your ass, Cartman!
Ms. Ellen: So you're alright?
Stan: Bluuuch.
Kyle: Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!
Mr. Garrison: Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes.
Tom: You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want.
Mr. Garrison: Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat: It sure is, Mr. Garrison!
Mr. Garrison: Hmmm.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, that's not bad.
Mr. Garrison: WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!
Tom: Alright-y then.
Tom: Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food.
Mr. Garrison: I can live with that.
Cartman: She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me!
Cartman: Until you puked on her.
Chef: Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
Stan: Yeah, that one!
Stan: No.
Wendy: Well it is!
Chef: That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
Kenny: (Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)
Wendy: Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?
Chef: That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it...
Stan: Sure, Wendy, whatever.
Kyle: Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents
Stan: Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!
Cartman: I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners
Anthropologist: ...And so, these ancient arrowheads are buried deep down in the earth's crust. We dig them up, polish them off, and find over twelve new arrowheads every month.
Cartman: Boooriing.
Mr. Garrison: Eric, keep quiet. I'm trying to sleep.
Anthropologist: Now, can anybody tell me, who left these arrowheads here?
Anthropologist: Well... yes, but I want to see if you're learning anything.
Stan: Oooh.
Anthropologist: Okay, I tell you what. Why don't we all grab our little anthropology pickaxes - that were handed out and we wuh dig for our very own Indian arrowheads.
Stan: Dude. Shut up, Cartman.
Pip: Oh! Oh I think I found one!
Pip: Oh. I do believe I found it first.
Pip: Oh dear.
Cartman: Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it.
Pip: What do you mean?
Pip: Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must.
Cartman: Okay, ready? I'll go first.
Pip: Well-uh I, I guess you win.
Cartman: Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it.
Stan: Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
Kyle: Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
Kenny: (Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed.)
Kyle: Yeah.
Stan: Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.
Ms. Crabtree: Come on, we're running late!
Stan: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
Ms. Crabtree: What did you say?!
Stan: I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
Ms. Crabtree: Oh. Alright, then.
Kyle: Whoa, dude.
Stan: I always wondered if that would work.
Liane: Hello, boys.
Liane: Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard.
Stan: In the backyard?
Cartman: Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?
Cartman: You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.
Cartman: Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?
Clyde: Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?
Cartman: Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.
Kenny: (I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea.)
Kyle: Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
Stan: No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
Kyle: Really?
Cartman: Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey.
Polly: Eric is the best!
Clyde: Hooray for Eric!
Peter: Eric kicks ass!
Kyle: Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman.
Stan: Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
Kyle: Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
Mr. Mackey: Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, m'kay?
Kyle: Woo-whataya mean?
Mr. Mackey: Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?
Stan: No.
Mr. Mackey: My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, m'kay?
Stan: Is that legal?
Mr. Mackey: Oh, hell yes!
Cartman: My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.
Polly: Oh, thank you, Eric. You are a perfect gentleman, and you are smart and true.
Cartman: That's niiice, Peter Panda.
Stan: Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
Kyle: How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
Stan: I donnow, just keep rolling.
Cartman: More tea, Rumpertumskin?
Rumpertumskin: Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and handsome.
Cartman: Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?
Clyde: I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
Cartman: Eeeyy!
Kitty: Meow.
Cartman: No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!
Kitty: Meow.
Cartman: No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!
Kitty: Hhhhhcck!
Liane: How is your beefy roast, snookums?
Cartman: Mom? Can I ask you a question?
Liane: Sure, hon.
Cartman: You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?
Liane: Uh huuuh.
Cartman: And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?
Liane: Yyeess??
Liane: Well, what's your question, hon?
Cartman: God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
Liane: Oooooohh.
Cartman: I want to know where I came from.
Cartman: Uh huuh.
Liane: And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha.
Cartman: So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
Liane: Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance.
Liane: I was young and naive then...
Man: Man, I've never seen a woman drink that much-you're amazing, Ms. Cartman.
Jimbo: Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance!
Liane: I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.
Cartman: So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?
Liane: Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
Liane: I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
Cartman: Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American.
Kitty: Meow.
Cartman: No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!
Announcer: In the harrowing made-for-TV drama, Not Without My Anus, based on a true story.
Terrance: Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter.
Phillip: Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance.
Annoncer: See Canada's hottest stars on the HBC movie of the week.
Grandpa: No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show.
Stan: Aaawww.
Bob Saget: Hey, I just flew into the studio.
Bob Saget: Boy are my arms tired. Heheh. Heh.
Bob Saget: Wha, Why didn't the skeleton cross the road? 'Cause he didn't have the guts.
Bob Saget: Knock knock.
Bob Saget: Bob.
Bob Saget: Bob Saget..
Stan: This guy sucks!
Stan: Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
Stan: What??
Cartman: Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!
Cartman: Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation.
Stan: What are you talking about, Cartman?!
Cartman: My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?
Stan: Go ahead, dude.
Kyle: Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
Stan: Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
Grandpa: Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes.
Chief Running Water: ...And Bear cried to Eagle-
Indian 1: Running Water, there is some kid here to see you.
Chief Running Water: What kid?
Cartman: Hiya, Dad!
Chief Running Water: Who the hell are you?
Cartman: I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Chief Running Water: Your mother?
Cartman: Liane Cartman.
Chief Running Water: Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as, 'Bear with Wiiide Canyon.'
Cartman: Whatooya mean?
Chief Running Water: She is, 'Doe who cannot keep legs together.'
Cartman: Huh??
Chief Running Water: Your mom's a slut.
Cartman: Eeyy!!
Chief Running Water: Don't feel too bad. Your mom was just too drunk to remember what happened. Let me tell you.
Chief Running Water: We got tired of dancing, so we went off to find a private spot.
Chief Running Water: There you are...
Chief Running Water: I knew that she wanted me, because she kept saying romantic things.
Liane: Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder.
Chief Running Water: Whoa, Helloooh!!
Liane: Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?
Chief Running Water: Huh??
Chef: Nawh. I'm new in town.
Chef: I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
Chef: Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?
Chief Running Water: He's the last person I saw with your mom that night.
Cartman: Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
Stan: Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
Stan: Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
Stan: Cartman?!
Cartman: I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
Kyle: You live on the Eastside, Cartman!
Stan: Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
Cartman: You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.
Kenny: (Guuyys! Could you please make it stoopp?!!)
Stan, Kyle: Hold on, Kenny!
Kenny: (Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-
Kenny: (AARGH.)
Kenny: (Goddamn, why-)
Kenny: (Oh this freakin'-)
Kenny: (AARGH.)
Kenny: (Phew.)
Kenny: (Well, I'm fine, guys!)
Kenny: (Now if I can-)
Stan: Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.
Kyle: You bastards!
Chef: Hello?
Cartman: Yo, Pops!
Cartman: You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?
Cartman: Westsa-eed-eh.
Cartman: You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Chef: What?! Noh! Uh, did I?
Cartman: He said you kissed her with your tongue.
Chef: Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.
Chef: Of course not. Here. You children sit down,
Chef: Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember.
Jimbo: Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos!
Bronco 1: Are we late for the party?
Chef: Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!
Chef: Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!
Mr. Garrison: You're drunk, Mr. Hat!
Chef: Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!
Liane: Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a menage o'three?
Cartman: No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!
Bob Saget: Here's a video sent to us that shows a very disturbed little boy.
Cartman: Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
Polly: I think you are one of the coolest people in the world, Eric. And you are not fat at all.
Cartman: Really? You don't think so?
Clyde: Naw, you're not fat.
Sharon: Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning.
Randy: Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?
Stan: How 'bout some ice cream?
Kyle: Yeah, with butterscotch.
Sharon: You bet, you poor dears.
Kyle: Woohoo!
Stan: Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!
Mr. Garrison: Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat: Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan, Mr. Garrison.
Cartman: All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!
Mr. Garrison: What the hell are you talking about, Eric?
Cartman: It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!
Jimbo: Garrison? That's impossible. He's gay.
Mr. Garrison: I am not gay!
Cartman: Then you did sleep with my mom?
Mr. Garrison: No!
Jimbo: He's gay!!
Mr. Garrison: Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?!
Mr. Garrison: Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman?
Principal Victoria: Oooooh.
Grizzled Man: I haven't.
Mr. Garrison: ...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs!
Halfy: Oh. Yeah.
Mr. Garrison: So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know.
Mephesto: At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is.
Mephesto: Yes, of course! I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but...
Cartman: How much?
Mephesto: Three thousand should cover it.
Cartman: I don't have $3000.
Mephesto: Oh. Never mind.
Stan: How's it going, Cartman?
Cartman: Oh, fine. How are you guys?
Kyle: Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
Cartman: Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.
Stan: Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?
Cartman: Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000.
Stan: Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
Cartman: Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...
Cartman: Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.
Kyle: Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
Cartman: You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!
Stan: Uh, yyeah.
Cartman: What kind of video did you guys make?
Stan: Uuh, you'll see.
Bob Saget: Well, it's time to crown the $10,000 winner. Our judges have narrowed it down to only three videos-first it's... "Dog Who Puts Hat On Master's Head."
Bob Saget: And now our second finalist, "Little Boy Has A Tea Party."
Cartman: Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
Polly: Oh, thank you, Eric.
Stan: We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money!
Cartman: I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.
Kyle: We're gonna win!.
Bob Saget: And finally our third contestant, "Young Child Gets Hit By A Train."
Falsetto Bob Saget: Oh, I'm such a cute little kid.
Falsetto Bob Saget: Hmmm, I wonder if I can get this go-cart started.
Falsetto Bob Saget: Oh! I hope I don't get hit by a train.
Falsetto Bob Saget: Ooooh, I sure did.
Stan: Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!
Kyle: You bastards!
Bob Saget: Now, that's what I call a joyride. Heeheeheeh.
Bob Saget: And the winner is, naturally, "Little Boy Being Hit By A Train,"
Bob Saget: Nnnnhnnnhnnnh.
Kyle: Dammit!
Bob Saget: Stand up and take a bow, Mr. Marsh.
Grandpa: I won! I won!
Stan: Grandpa!!
Bob Saget: Our other finalists will have to settle for their $3000 runner-up prizes-well, see you next time.
Kyle: Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
Mephesto: The test results are in this envelope.
Mephesto: Shall I... open it?
Jimbo: Nope. He's gay.
Mr. Garrison: You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
Announcer: Is it Jimbo?
Announcer: Or is Officer Barbrady?
Officer Barbrady: Huh?! Where?!
Announcer: Or could it be Ned?
Ned: Could be.
Announcer: Or Mr. Broflovski??
Announcer 2: Terrance and Phillip in HBC's Movie of the Week:
Scott the Dick: Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer.
Scott: That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance!
Phillip: Oh, Terrance, You farted in court.
Terrance: Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?
Phillip: Yes, please.
Terrance: That's called the monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys.
Phillip: The monkey claw is smelly.
Judge: That is correct.
Terrance: Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument.
Phillip: I have, haven't I, Terrance?
Phillip: Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?
Phillip: Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.
Phillip: Just kidding.
Phillip: The defense rests.
Scott: Goddammit. That isn't funny.
Judge: Madame Foreperson, have you reached a verdict so we can get the hell outta here?!
Madame Foreperson: We have, Your Honor. We have found Terrance, in the above entitled action of murder against Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer--
Judge: You're gonna have to repeat that verdict because we have some flatulence issues.
Madame Foreperson: I said, we find--
Madame Foreperson: We find Terrance--
Madame Foreperson: Not guilty!
Phillip: Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty.
Terrance: Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber.
Terrance: That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kroff Dinner.
Phillip: Hear hear.
Phillip: Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?
Phillip: 'Cause you're a dick?
Scott: No, Because I hate you. You think farting is so funny. Well it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--
Scott: Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer.
Phillip: Cancer?
Scott: Yes. In the head.
Terrance: Head cancer?
Terrance: Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip.
Phillip: Yes, perhaps he's homophobic.
Terrance: Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kroff Dinner.
Phillip: Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kroff Dinner can calm my nerves.
Terrance: Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.
Phillip: He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.
Terrance: God only knows.
Phillip: The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance.
Terrance: It sure is. Let's look for treasure.
Phillip: Yes, let's look for treasure.
Scott: Hello?
Voice: Hello, Is this Scott, from Canada?
Scott: Yess, yes it is.
Voice: You're a Journalist, right?
Scott: Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.
Voice: I understand that you hate Terrance and Phillip.
Scott: Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!
Voice: Well, what about I help you get rid of them once and for all?
Scott: Who is this?
Voice: Let's just say that I'm someone who can help you, if you help me.
Voice: Just call me your old pal, Saddam Hussein.
Saddam Hussein: Eey, relax guy. I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest.
Scott: What do you want?
Scott: I'm not sure I should trust you.
Saddam: Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me!
Terrance: Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.
Phillip: Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob.
Ugly Bob: Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip.
Terrance: My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
Ugly Bob: How can you guys say stuff like that?
Terrance: Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob.
Ugly Bob: I know, but--
Phillip: Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver.
Ugly Bob: I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside.
Phillip: Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?
Terrance: Yes.
Terrance: If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.
Ugly Bob: Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks.
Terrance: Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you.
Ugly Bob: Thanks, you guys.
Phillip: Hello Barky. Hello Purry.
Barky: Bark, bark.
Purry: Purr, purr.
Phillip: Say Terrance, I was just aboot to make some Kroff Dinner. Would you like some?
Terrance: You know I never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip.
Terrance: I'm going to put on a pirate costume.
Delivery Man: Special delivery for Terrance.
Phillip: I'll take that.
Phillip: What is it, Terrance? Did you fart?
Terrance: No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.
Phillip: Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally? God, why? Say, Terrance, who's Sally?
Terrance: My daughter.
Phillip: I never know you had a daughter, Terrance.
Terrance: Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?
Phillip: No, you never did, Terrance.
Terrance: Oh. Well. It all began fifteen years ago.
Phillip: My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion.
Phillip: Then I'll go with you, Terrance.
Terrance: You're such a good friend, Phillip.
Phillip: Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kroff Dinner.
Terrance: Avast there, mateys.
Terrance: Hello, Celine Dion.
Celine Dion: Terrance, this is quite a surprise.
Terrance: You're looking well.
Celine Dion: And you.
Terrance: Celine, where is our daughter, Sally?
Celine Dion: She's in the Middle East, studying anthropology. Why?
Terrance: Wrong. She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner.
Celine Dion: What?!
Terrance: Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return.
Celine Dion: Please, bring our daughter home safe, Terrance.
Phillip: Hello, Ugly Bob.
Ugly Bob: Hi, guys.
Terrance: How's the paper bag working out?
Ugly Bob: People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday.
Terrance: Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please.
Ugly Bob: Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there!
Ugly Bob: All right, then. There's a flight leaving today.
Phillip: Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance.
Terrance: In-deed, Phillip.
Phillip: Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kroff Dinner.
Terrance: Same here, Phillip!
Scott: Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon.
Saddam: Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon.
Scott: The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.
Saddam: Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?
Scott: Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
Saddam: Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain.
Scott: Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out.
Terrance: I Got Ya.
Phillip: Burned your face.
Terrance: Ow, that's rancid. hahahahaha.
Terrance: Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin.
Phillip: Oh, look. There she is.
Terrance: Oh, good.
Sally: Goo. Where?
Terrance: I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance.
Terrance: I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.
Sally: Pa-pa.
Phillip: Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance.
Phillip: Oh, now I see the resemblance!
Terrance: Well, enough of Iran, let's get home.
Terrance: Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again.
Phillip: Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend.
Terrance: No, you're gaining a pop vocalist.
Phillip: Is this Canada?
Terrance: It seems to have changed.
Phillip: This is madness!
Terrance: What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?
Phillip: I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?
Terrance: I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.
Terrance: Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--
Celine Dion: Terrance, ha, could you come back a little later?
Terrance: Why?!
Celine Dion: Ah, I'm just a little busy right now.
Terrance: You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?
Celine Dion: Well, I...
Ugly Bob: Hi guys.
Phillip: Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!!
Ugly Bob: I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like?
Terrance: Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!
Celine Dion: What do you mean? Why are you calling him "Ugly Bob"?
Phillip: Because that's his name, you stupid bitch!
Celine Dion: You told me your name "Handsome Bob"!
Terrance: Look at him, Celine Dion.
Celine Dion: Aaaaaaaaaaaagggggghhhhh!!!
Phillip: Behold his horrible face.
Celine Dion: Oh my God, he's hideously ugly! And I am pregnant with his child!
Terrance: What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!!
Celine Dion: I'm going to have a freak baby!!
Phillip: Ohh, the humanity!!
Scott: Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?
Saddam: Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest.
Scott: ...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot.
Saddam: Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran.
Scott: I thought you were from Iraq.
Saddam: Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!
Terrance: Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada.
Phillip: Yes. I agree whole-fartedly.
Scott: Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?
Terrance: Oh, hello, Scott.
Scott: You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--
Scott: Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?
Phillip: Wait, what were you saying?
Scott: Nothing, why?
Terrance: Hey, Scott. Guess what?
Scott: What?
Scott: Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both!
Phillip: What are you doing, Scott?
Scott: I'm wishing cancer upon you.
Phillip: Cancer?!
Scott: That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.
Terrance: Ooh, stop that!
U.S. Army Official: Mr. Hussein, the U.S. Government is becoming worried.
Saddam: Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax.
U.S. Army Official: You seem to be... taking over Canada.
Saddam: Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs.
U.S. Army Official: We didn't say anything about bombs.
Saddam: Oh. You didn't? Hey, relax.
U.S. Army Official: We're giving you just three years to clear your forces out of Canada, and after that, we're gonna bomb all of Iran.
Saddam: I'm from Iraq.
U.S. Army Official: Iran, Iraq, what's the difference?
Guard on Right: Euugh. I hate Americans. Please, let me kill them!
Saddam: No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world!
Saddam: Nothing! Relax, brother.
Scott: Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!
Saddam: Oh, really?
Scott: You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!
Scott: This deal's getting worse all the time.
Phillip: Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television.
Terrance: Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.
Woman 1: ...well fuck you.
Springer: And this is what life would be like...
Terrance: It's so stupid!
Phillip: Goddamn, their TV shows are lame!
Mephesto: The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is--
Phillip: Look at their silly American heads.
Terrance: They look like groundhogs.
Cartman: He's my father?!
Anchor: And in other news it appears that Saddam Hussein has finally signed an agreement to let the U.S. inspect his military operations. When asked if he would uphold his side of the agreement, Hussein replied, quote: "Hey, relax, fella. You need a rest, guy."
Terrance: Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?
Phillip: Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator.
Terrance: Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kroff Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks!
Phillip: That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance.
Terrance: It sure did, Phillip.
Terrance: Hello?
Scott: Terrance, this is Scott.
Phillip: Tell him he's a smelly bastard.
Terrance: Phillip says hello, Scott.
Scott: Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer.
Terrance: You are such a dick, Scott.
Scott: The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada. You give other Canadians a bad name. And if I had my hair-
Terrance: I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?
Scott: Sure.
Terrance: How do you like that, Scott?!
Scott: You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--
Terrance: Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?
Scott: Sure.
Terrance: Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'
Scott: Goddammit!
Terrance: Oh, wait a second, Scott.
Scott: Sure.
Celine Dion: Oh, Ugly Bob, I'm so confused. I love your personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly.
Ugly Bob: Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.
Celine Dion: We can only hope. I suppose we'll be okay as long as you keep that bag on your head.
Saddam: He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion.
Ugly Bob: Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch.
Saddam: Eh! Who are you?
Ugly Bob: I'm Bob. But my friends call me "Ugly Bob", because I have the features of a deformed burn victim.
Saddam: Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.
Saddam: Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours.
Ugly Bob: You can?
Saddam: Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
Celine Dion: What? Why?
Saddam: Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it. Look over here. All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?
Ugly Bob: Did you say, "hostile takeover of Canada"?
Saddam: No, no, relax there, fella!
Terrance: Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up.
Phillip: Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?
Terrance: Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure.
Terrance: We're looking for treasure!
Scott: Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?
Phillip: No, we're searching for treasure.
Scott: Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.
Terrance: Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.
Scott: Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?
Phillip: What do you mean?
Phillip: You mean, we are to blame?!
Scott: That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this.
Phillip: What is this?
Scott: It's a bomb. You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions.
Terrance: That plan's scary!
Scott: Well, you must do it for Canada.
Phillip: For Canada, Terrance.
Terrance: For Canada, Phillip.
Scott: Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.
Terrance: Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.
Phillip: Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life.
Terrance: That's funny!
Phillip: Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.
Terrance: Why is that?
Phillip: That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?
Terrance: Yes. Apparently, he does.
Phillip: Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!
Terrance: Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.
Phillip: I do, Terrance.
Terrance: Well, I guess it's time, old friend.
Phillip: Yes. Prepare the alert!
Saddam: Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.
Saddam: You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as "New Baghdad!" Qoloh Qalah!
Saddam: You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!
Saddam: And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem...
Saddam: Or you will be stabbed in the head!
Celine Dion: Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht...
Terrance: Now, Phlllip?
Phlllip: Now, Terrance.
Saddam: Hey!! What the hell is this?
Celine: Freh kashu kaliakaliakatchut...
Guard: They're using chemical warfare! How could they?!
Terrance: We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!
Phillip: Oh, Glorious Day!
Celine Dion: Phillip, Terrance! You've saved Canada!
Terrance: Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea.
Phillip: We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada.
Scott: Oh! That is so juvenile!
Terrance: Hey, Scott, you like apples?
Scott: Of course!
Terrance: Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
Celine Dion: You're right, Terrance. You're right.
Announcer 2: Previously, on South Park: an air of sobriety fills the laboratory as the men of South Park gather to find out which one of them fathered this boy.
Mephesto: And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room.
Cartman: Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.
Stan: Oooh- hey, Kenny.
Mephesto: Gentlemen, the father is...
Mr. Garrison: Hey, what the hell's going on?
Jimbo: It's a power outage!
Chef: Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
Officer Barbrady: Oh my God, look!
Kenny: (Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)
Kyle: You bastards!
Mr. Garrison: Mephesto's been shot.
Chef: Is he ...dead?
Jimbo: Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!
Mr. Garrison: Then who was it?
Announcer 1: Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it--
Cartman: Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
Announcer 1: Or was it Sheila Broflovski?
Cartman: You've got to be kidding me!
Chef: Come on, children!
Cartman: Eeeehh..!
Gerald Broflovski: Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell for him going through all this.
Jimbo: There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
Mr. Garrison: Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
Announcer 1: Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos?
Cartman: Is he awake yet?
Chef: Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
Kyle: What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
Stan: Could you pull over so I can get out?
Stan: I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
Chef: Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?
Kyle: Man, it's really starting to snow.
Kyle: I hope they don't close the roads.
Cartman: They can't. Mephesto can't die.
Cartman: No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.
Kyle: Really?
Cartman: Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
Cartman: No! Don't!
Cartman: Eh--
Jimbo: What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!
Sheila: We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
Officer Barbrady: Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking.
Man: Mayor! Mayor!
Greenfield: We're desperate for stories.
Greenfield: A-and this one is so compelling.
Greenfield: Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
Mayor McDaniels: Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?
Jimbo: Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--
Mayor McDaniels: Shh.
Greenfield: We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins.
Mayor McDaniels: Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
Cameraman: It is?
Greenfield: Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
Announcer 1: Who will the director cast first? Will it be Mr. Garrison? Officer Barbrady? Chef?
Liane: I want to have... an abortion.
Receptionist: Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs...
Liane: Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.
Receptionist: Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?
Liane: About eight years ago.
Liane: Eight years old.
Receptionist: Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion.
Liane: Really?
Receptionist: Yes, this is what we would refer to as the "fortieth trimester".
Liane: But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
Receptionist: Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman.
Kyle: Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
Cartman: Yeah, stop being a wuss!
Chef: Doctor!
Kyle: Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!
Dr. Doctor: We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son.
Chef: Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!
Dr. Doctor: I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle.
Dr. Doctor: There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of.
Stan: Oogh.
Nurse: Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone.
Stan: Ooooogh.
Dr. Doctor: Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside.
Dr. Doctor: Oops, he's hemorrhaging.
Stan: Aghh!
Stan: I'm gotta get outta here!
Kyle: Stan!
Dr. Doctor: Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach.
Assistant: Call the Mr. Garrison auditions!
Garrison 1: Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
Greenfield: Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!
Mr. Garrison: I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat: You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!
Greenfield: Thank you! Next!
Greenfield: Next!
Greenfield: Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs!
Liane: ...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.
O'Reilly: Well, all I know is that third-trimester abortions are illegal. I don't really know anything about 40th.
Liane: But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
O'Reilly: No- No, I think youah gotta talk to the governor about that stuff.
Liane: Oh, dear.
Dr. Doctor: Well, this is about all I can do for him.
Cartman: Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
Dr. Doctor: Sorry, son, it might be a while.
Cartman: Wake up, you son of a bitch!
Chef: Whoa!
Dr. Doctor: Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition.
Cartman: I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
Kyle: Hey, Cartman.
Cartman: What?
Stan: Okay okay, let's get outta here now!
Dr. Doctor: My God, that's a hell of a storm.
Stan: Oh, weak.
Greenfield: God, I hate mountains. This better not push back our shooting schedule.
Greenfield: Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it.
Greenfield: Who's that?
Assistant: Oh, that's TV's Eric Roberts. We were able to get him to play the part of the little monkey guy.
Greenfield: Whoa. Talk about "all washed-up", huh? Great to have you, Eric!
Greenfield: Here we go, aaand action.
Mephesto Actor: I want to announce who the father is.
Greenfield: Bang!!
Barbrady Actor: Nobody move! I'm a law officer!
Chef Actor: My God, I think he's gone into cardiac arrest!
Barbrady Actor: You seem somewhat unnerved by this, Chef.
Chef Actor: Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because if you are accusing me, don't hide behind your clever riddles!
Barbrady Actor: Our differences must be set aside for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man, a man trying to do my job.
Officer Barbrady: Whoa, this is a good movie!
Stan: Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
Blonde: Doctor, I can't focus!
Dr. Doctor: We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly.
Chef: Wait a second. They've closed the pass??
Dr. Doctor: Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked.
Dr. Doctor: Metaphorically speaking, that is.
Cartman: What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
Dr. Doctor: He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out.
Mr. Hat Actor: Right away, Mr. Garrison.
Eric Roberts as Kevin: No, no! My lifetime partner and friend, gone, taken away in the wink of an eye. O, Fortune, why do you mock me?
Greenfield: What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!
Chef Actor: I'm going to get the man to a hospital. Who will help me?
Eric Roberts: This is not a world I want to live in! Doesn't anyone want--
Greenfield: God-dammit!
Greenfield: What the hell is this?!
Cameraman: We've lost the feed to L.A.
Announcer 1: Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo? Mr. Garrison? Chef?
Greenfield: Somebody go see why we lost the hookup!
Jimbo: Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!
Nurse Goodly: Don't panic, anybody. The power lines are down, but the backup generator is running just fine.
Goodly: Coming!
Cartman: Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
Goodly: Yes, for now. But I'm afraid the generator won't run for long. The batteries run out in half an hour. Time is very short.
Dr. Doctor: Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!
Dr. Doctor: Oh, sorry.
Liane: Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.
Liane: I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...
Dr. Doctor: Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly.
Chef: What do you want me to do?
Dr. Doctor: Do you know anything about surgery?
Dr. Doctor: What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives.
Stan: No way, dude!
Greenfield: We're snowed in?
Mayor McDaneils: Yes. We're trapped!
Mayor McDaniels: My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen.
Assistant: Oh I have to get out of here, I haven't eaten since breakfast.
Jimbo: I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.
Greenfield: Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?
Jimbo: That's the law of land, Mr. Director. It ain't pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it.
Jimbo: Well, we draw straws.
Greenfield: Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?
Jimbo: Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws.
Announcer 1: Who the hell made Jimbo boss? Was it Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Gar--
Stan: No.
Dr. Doctor: Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart.
Stan: Bleech!
Kyle: Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
Cartman: Sweet.
Dr. Doctor: Suction!
Cartman: Hey, who's screwing with the lights?
Announcer 1: Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos?
Officer Barbrady: Wooo!
Jimbo: Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
Officer Barbrady: The short what?
Mr. Garrison: Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling.
Dr. Doctor: I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital.
Chef: So how do we get to it?
Dr. Doctor: We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny.
Dr. Doctor: Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct.
Dr. Doctor: Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?
Cartman: Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.
Dr. Doctor: Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!
Kenny: (Huh?)
Mr. Garrison: I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...
Jimbo: We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
Eric Roberts: No! No, please!
Jimbo: God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight!
Jimbo: What time is it, Barbrady?
Barbrady: It's almost midnight.
Jimbo: We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.
Greenfield: What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?
Dr. Doctor: Team B? Come in, Team B.
Kenny: (This is Team B.)
Dr. Doctor: Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage.
Kenny: (Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
Dr. Doctor: Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left.
Kenny: (Yup! I see it in the drift.)
Dr. Doctor: Good. Head towards it. Team A out.
Cartman: What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?
Mayor McDaniels: My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.
Announcer 1: Who built the pyramids? Was it the Babylonians? Officer Barbrady? Samaritans?
Kenny: (Okay, I've reached the generator)
Kenny: (Roger.)
Dr. Doctor: Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?
Kenny: (Negative.)
Dr. Doctor: Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed.
Kyle: D'you have any wire here?
Dr. Doctor: There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!
Kenny: (I'll stick 'em together)
Dr. Doctor: No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands.
Kyle: No, he'll die!
Cartman: Go, Kenny!
Dr. Doctor: Kenny! Nnnoooooo!
Kenny: (Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)
Stan: Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle: You bastard!
Chef: The power!
Dr. Doctor: Quickly! Get the scanner running again!
Dr. Doctor: We've got a chance now!
President Bill Clinton: Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you.
Clinton: Why yes, that's what an abortion is.
Clinton: Adoption?
Liane: Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption.
Clinton: Well, that's- pretty different.
Liane: Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President.
Dr. Doctor: Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine.
Chef: You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--
Mephesto: Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.
Chef: Ooohhh.
Dr. Doctor: Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.
Chef: He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.
Stan: He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
Kyle: He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
Cartman: Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop.
Kyle: I don't know. Let's find out.
Mr. Garrison: Ohh. It's over! We're free!
Officer Barbrady: Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?
Jimbo: Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.
Mayor McDaniels: But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
Ned: Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time.
Mr. Garrison: Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?
Mephesto: I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--
Cartman: Just tell us already!
Chef: What???
Mr. Garrison: Noo, that doesn't make sense!
Mr. Garrison: Uh-meaning what?
Mephesto: Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.
Liane: It's true.
Mephesto: No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis.
Mephesto: The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Cartman: Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.
Liane: I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.
Liane: I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.
Cartman: Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!
Mephesto: Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing.
Announcer 1: Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?
Cartman: Ooohhh, forget it!
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus.
Kyle: Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
Kyle: Wow, these books look cool!
Cartman: Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.
Kenny: (There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)
Kyle: Who are you?
Kyle: Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical.
Cartman: I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these.
Kenny: (Hey, what's that?)
Stan: I don't know. Let's go see.
Officer Barbrady: Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong.
Officer Barbrady: There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no Podunk little town!
Dispatcher: And, Barbrady, your wife called. She wants you to get some pizza on the way home.
Officer Barbrady: Goddammit!
Rancher: Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens.
Officer Barbrady: Uhhhh... oh.
Woman: My God, that's disgusting!
Stan: Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
Rancher: Naw, I didn't see anything. It just happened so fast.
Officer Barbrady: Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?
Cameraman: Uhh, we're gonna go grab some lunch and maybe get some shots of those turtles down at the pond.
Officer Barbrady: Haw, camel poo.
Stan: Hey, what's this?
Kyle: It looks like a note.
Officer Barbrady: Uhh... It says, uuh, "Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye." Well, there you have it. Case closed.
Rancher: Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say "Nothin' to see here", and "Case closed." But we want justice. We have to find this sicko!
Officer Barbrady: I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people.
Rancher: For what? Orderly conduct?
Officer Barbrady: How about fishing without a license?
Rancher: I'm not fishin'.
Officer Barbrady: Whataya call this then?
Kyle: Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
Stan: Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.
Teller: Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you?
Teller: Sir, can I help you?
Officer Barbrady: Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeo poppers.
Teller: Sure, there's just one problem.
Officer Barbrady: What's that?
Teller: We're a bank.
Officer Barbrady: I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?
Teller: Yes.
Anchor: With chicken after chicken being violated, the South Park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the Chickenfucker. We now go live to a press conference where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are fielding questions.
Reporter 1: Officer Barbrady, what would drive a man to such a disgusting act?
Officer Barbrady: Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established.
Reporter 2: Do the police have any leads?
Officer Barbrady: Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet.
Reporter 3: But has Chickenfucker left any clues at the crime?
Officer Barbrady: All right, all right! I can't read!
Officer Barbrady: There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire!
Press Coordinator: Okay, thank you all for coming. There's uhh, coffee and brownies out front.
Anchor: And so Officer Barbrady has taken a leave of absence, and South Park would have to manage without any police force for a while--
Anchor: This just in! South Park is plunged into total anarchy!
Anchor: Exactly two seconds after the retirement of Officer Barbrady, looting and pillaging erupted in the quiet mountain town!
Looter 1: Whoopee, this is killer!
Looter 2: With no cops around, we can do whatever we want!
Kyle: Whoa, dude, what's going on?
Stan: I don't know.
Stan: Oh my God, they've killed--
Stan: Oh, never mind.
Mayor McDaniels: I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful.
Aide 1: Who knew? I always thought he was a complete idiot.
Mayor McDaniels: He is.
Reporter 3: What do you plan to do about the South Park riots?
Mayor McDaniels: No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.
Reporter 3: But he's illiterate. What do you plan to do?
Mayor McDaniels: Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh--
Aide 2: Reading classes, plain and simple. By the mayor's order, Officer Barbrady is on temporary leave of absence to learn to read, effective immediately.
Mayor McDaniels: Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady!
Mr. Garrison: Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady.
Stan: I can't see, dude!
Mr. Garrison: Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics.
Mr. Garrison: E-yes, what is it?
Officer Barbrady: I need to go poopies.
Officer Barbrady: Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?
Mr. Garrison: Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?
Kyle: How about a brain transplant?
Mr. Garrison: Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it.
Mr. Garrison: Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady: Ahhh... O... O--
Mr. Garrison: Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared.
Officer Barbrady: Ahhh... O...
Mr. Garrison: Bzzzt drrrrr! Did you hear that, Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat: I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard!
Stan: No, we just fake it to shut him up.
Mr. Garrison: Okayheh, okay hi'm sohry. I'm sohry heh. Let's try again.
Intruder: So, what are nice chickens like you doing in a coop like this?
Mr. Garrison: Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports.
Mr. Garrison: Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see...
Mr. Garrison: Eric, why don't you go first?
Cartman: Oooaaagh.
Mr. Garrison: What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again?
Cartman: I'm prepared!
Mr. Garrison: No, I can't say that I have.
Mr. Garrison: And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down!
Cartman: God-dammit!
Officer Barbrady: Haa haa. Ha ha ha.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report?
Mr. Garrison: Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A.
Officer Barbrady: Hooray!
Stan: Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
Kyle: Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
Mayor McDaniels: Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?!
Kenny: (Daaarrrggghh--)
Kenny: (-ooggghhh...)
Stan: Oh, my God! They've killed--
Kenny: (Hey.)
Mayor McDaniels: Well, how's the reading coming along?
Mayor McDaniels: Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night.
Kyle: Oh no!.
Aide 2: This time he made love to Carla Weathers' prize chicken. She's catatonic.
Officer Barbrady: Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?
Officer Barbrady: Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's.
Officer Barbrady: I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
Mayor McDaniels: Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever!
Officer Barbrady: Oh boy, I'm in big trouble.
Officer Barbrady: I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos.
Stan: It's cool, dude. We'll help you.
Cartman: Really? I wanna be a cop.
Officer Barbrady: You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset.
Cartman: Do I get a nightstick?
Officer Barbrady: Sure, nightsticks for everybody!
Officer Barbrady: You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case.
Officer Barbrady: Now, what did that clue say again?
Officer Barbrady: To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!
Stan, Kyle, Kenny: Hooray!
Bus Driver: Good day, friends. Welcome to the magical world of reading.
Bus Driver: Oohhh, that's a very magical book, full of wondrous--
Officer Barbrady: Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake!
Kyle: What's it say?
Stan: I.
Officer Barbrady: Oh, yeah. "I... mmuh mmuh--"
Stan: A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
Officer Barbrady: That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!
Cartman: Ey!
Randy: Uhh, yes, Officer?
Cartman: I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
Randy: Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour.
Cartman: Step out of the car, please, sir.
Randy: Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
Randy: Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.
Randy: Ow!
Cartman: Get your ass to jail!
Randy: Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!
Randy: Ooww!
Officer Barbrady: Oh, weak, dude! We're too late!
Stan: Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
Father Maxi: Well, this is terrible! Now, who would have sex with a chicken?
Mr. Garrison: Aw, you couldn't screw anything, Halfy. You don't have any legs!
Father Maxi: Have some respect for people's feelings, would you, Halfy?!
Officer Barbrady: Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.
Kyle: Here! Here, I found one!
Stan: What's it say? What's it say?
Stan: I dunno.
Cartman: Well, hi there.
Driver: Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?
Cartman: Sir, step out of the car, please.
Looter 3: I got a TV.
Looter 4: Shh. Come on!
Kyle: How's it goin', dude?
Officer Barbrady: Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo.
Stan: Come on, dude, it's not that hard!
Officer Barbrady: It is, too!
Kyle: Just read the sentence.
Officer Barbrady: "Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"
Kyle: Come on, dumbass, you can do it!
Mr. Garrison: Conjugate the verb. Conjugate the verb.
Mr. Hat: Yes, conjugate the verb.
Officer Barbrady: Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!
Dispatcher 3: All units, all units. Five-twelve at 635 Avenue de los Mexicanos; request assistance.
Cartman: Sir, could you step out of the car, please?
Cartman: And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?
Stuart: Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids--
Kenny: (Hi, Cartman.)
Stuart: --and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year.
Cartman: Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a...
Mrs. McCormick: I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!
Stuart: Shut up, bitch!
Cartman: Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh.
Mrs. McCormick: You lazy-ass motherfucker!
Stuart: Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.
Mrs. McCormick: I'll do it again!
Kevin: Mom hit Dad again!
Cartman: Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!
Kenny: (Goddammit, Cartman!)
Stuart: Aagh!
Dispatcher 1: All units. All units. We have a 5-20 on the suspect. Report to the South Park petting zoo immediately!
Officer Barbrady: Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute.
Stan: Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
Kyle: Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.
Officer Barbrady: Oh, no!
Officer Barbrady: Shhh!
Officer Barbrady: Keep your eyes peeled.
Stan: Look!
Kyle: He's here!
Officer Barbrady: Grab him!
Cartman: Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!
Stan: Goddammit!
Officer Barbrady: I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!
Stan: Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.
Officer Barbrady: Oh.
Kyle: Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!
Officer Barbrady: Caught you red-handed!
Bus Driver: Indeed, you did. How did you know I would strike here?
Stan: What are you talking about, dude?!
Bus Driver: When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!
Kyle: So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
Bus Driver: Yes! Yes, exactly! Don't you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate.
Stan: That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
Bus Driver: Oh, no? He who was blind can now see!
Bus Driver: I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly.
Officer Barbrady: Well, I guess I should say "Thanks?"
Kyle: Cartman!
Kyle: Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
Cartman: A-ha!
Bus Driver: Ow, that hurts!
Kyle: Whoa, dude!
Stan: Cartman!
Barbrady: You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker.
Cartman: Ooohhhh.
Kyle: I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
Barbrady: Well anyway, I'm relieving you of your duties. I've proved that I can read, and now I'm back on the job!
Stan/Kyle: Hooray!
Stan: Hey! So what are you going to do now?
Anchor: And so today South Park held a parade to honor Officer Barbrady and his heroic work on the Chickenfucker case.
Officer Barbrady: Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
Man 1: Speech! Speech!
Stan: They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
Officer Barbrady: Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious.
Man 2: Oh, yeah!
Stan/Kyle: Hooray!
Stan, Kyle: Hooray for Barbrady!
Cartman: Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.
Stan: I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
Kyle: It's poetic justice.
Kenny: (Ow!)
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey.
Mr. Mackey: Nuh-now, who was that?
Mr. Mackey: Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, okay, okay, that's fine.
Cartman: M'kay?
Mr. Mackey: You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad.
Mr. Mackey: You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. M'kay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?
Mr. Mackey: Yes, Stan?
Stan: Why do dogs have cold noses?
Mr. Mackey: Uhhh, well, I'm not sure.
Stan: Oh.
Mr. Mackey: Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana.
Mr. Mackey: Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,
Mr. Mackey: ...so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,
Mr. Mackey: ...and when it gets back up to me,
Mr. Mackey: ...we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you...
Kyle: Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
Stan: Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
Kyle: No, it's his bris.
Cartman: What the hell is a "bris"?
Kyle: I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
Cartman: Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!
Mr. Mackey: ...and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?
Mr. Mackey: No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney...
Kyle: Uhhh... I'm not sure.
Stan: Well, dude, you better find out!
Mr. Mackey: Boys, are you paying attention?
Stan: Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey: Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet?
Mr. Mackey: Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now?
Mr. Mackey: Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey: Uh-oh.
Mr. Mackey: I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria.
Principal Victoria: We-hell, "sorry" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school.
Principal Victoria: Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes.
Mr. Mackey: But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--
Mr. Mackey: But--
Principal Victoria: There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.
Stan: Man! That sucked, getting searched.
Cartman: I wonder who took it.
Chef: Hello there, children.
Boys: Hey, Chef.
Kyle: How's it going?
Chef: Bad.
Kyle: Why bad?
Stan: No, dude, we never even saw it!
Kyle: Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
Kyle: No.
Cartman: I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.
Chef: Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?
Boys: Dude!
Kyle: Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
Stan: What do ya mean?
Chef: Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
Cartman: Wo-what's that?
Chef: Oh boy. Here we go again.
Chef: Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
Stan: Ahhh, bicycles?
Cartman: Ham?
Kyle: No, not ham, you fat fuck!
Cartman: Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?
Chef: No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body.
Kyle: Your heart?
Stan: Your eyes?
Chef: That's right.
Cartman: Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.
Chef: A "fireman"?
Chef: Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?
Chef: Ask your parents for once!
Kyle: Hey, wait!
Stan: Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
Female passenger: Hey, Mackey, you got any more pot? My four-year-old needs a fix! Yehahahahaha!
Driver 3: Hey, Mackey! Why did the drug user cross the road?
Driver 3's Passenger: Who do you think you are, you stupid drug-taking hippie?! You damn hippies are all alike!
Driver 4: Won't you leave the guy alone?
Driver 5: Hey, hippie, are you gonna do some drugs?
Mr. Mackey: Uuuuuugh!
Bartender: Hey, I don't think I've seen you around here before.
Mr. Mackey: Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job.
Mr. Mackey: Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay?
Bartender: So how do you feel?
Bartender: Oh, you just need something a little stronger.
Kyle: Stop who?
Stan: Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
Kyle: What?
Stan: They're gonna chop off his wee wee!
Kyle: Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
Stan: Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
Kyle: That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
Stan: Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
Cartman: Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!
Mr. Mackey: Whoa... Is this my house?
Mr. Mackey: Why, Mr. Freely?
Mr. Freely: I'm not rentin' to you anymore! I heard that you got fired from your job for selling drugs to children!
Mr. Mackey: No, no, no, m'kay? I-it wasn't like that.
Mr. Freely: Drugs are an illegal narcotic! And having never taken drugs, I can say that they have nothing to offer!
Mr. Mackey: Huuhh?
Mr. Freely: Drug user! Druuug user!
Mr. Freely: Come back here, dammit!
Mr. Mackey: Whoa, wait!
Sheila: Just a little higher.
Kyle: Mom! Dad!
Gerald: Your mother's made gahekgafuga.
Cartman: What the hell is gahekgafuga?
Kyle: Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
Kyle: Meaning what?
Gerald: Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--
Kyle: AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!
Gerald: Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him?
Sheila, Gerald: Let us cut off you pee pee, Stan!
Stan, Cartman: AAAAGGGGHHHH!!!! Aaagg-that's the sickest friggin' thing-run, ruuun!
Kenny: (Run, dude!)
Sheila: Oy, what is the matter with them?
Kyle: I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
Stan: What are you goin' to do, dude?
Kyle: I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!
Kyle: Come on, Ike!
Kyle: Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
Cartman: No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!
Kyle: Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike!
Mr. Mackey: Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?
Hobo: Hey, you want somethin' to warm you up?
Mr. Mackey: Marijuwana's bad.
Hobo: What?
Mr. Mackey: Ma-marijuwana makes you feel depressed and low, m'kay?
Hobo: And you don't fell that way now?
Mr. Mackey: Oh, good point.
Mr. Mackey: No, I don't feel any d-oooohh...
Mr. Mackey: Oh, baby, get down, m'kay?
Hobo: Uh-huh.
Hobo: Ohh, boy.
Clerk: Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes.
Kyle: You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?
Ike: No!
Kyle: I need one ticket for my little brother.
Clerk: That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
Kyle: Huh?
Clerk: I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train.
Kyle: But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
Clerk: What?! Why the hell would they do that?
Kyle: They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
Clerk: No can do, sonny.
Kyle: Dammit!
Kyle: Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.
Kyle: Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
Ike: Don't kick the--
Kyle: Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
Ike: Bye-bye.
Mr. Mackey: Oh, man, where am I?
Teen 1: Hey, wow, it's that counselor from elementary school, Mr. Mackey.
Teen 2: Wow, dude.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, hi, boys, how are you today?
Teen 1: Pretty good, man. How are you?
Mr. Mackey: Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs.
Teen 1: Hey! Us, too!
Teen 2: Yeah, remember? You caught us smoking weed in the bathroom and got us suspended.
Mr. Mackey: Oh. O Fortune, how you mock me?
Teen 1: Oh, cheer up, bro; all you need is some clear liquid to get your head straight.
Mr. Mackey: Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm...
Mr. Mackey: Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth?
Mr. Mackey: Yeah, baby... The world is so small.
Mr. Mackey: I'm free... I'm free...
Teen 2: Sweet dude, totally killer.
Teen 1: That guy's totally trippin'.
Kyle: There, what do you think?
Kyle: I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
Stan: Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
Kyle: Not when if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.
Kyle: No, go away! Bad dog!
Stan: Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
Kyle: I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
Cartman: Is that why it stinks so bad?
Mr. Mackey: Hi, boys.
Boys: Hi, Mr. Mackey.
Mr. Mackey: Are you boys stayin' out of trouble?
Boys: Yes.
Mr. Mackey: Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while.
Kyle: Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.
Kyle: Knock it off, asshole!
Cartman: No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
Stan: Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you.
Cartman: Eech.
Cartman: Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!
Ike: Oh.
Ike: Oooh.
Ike: Yeah. No more walbolching!
Kyle: Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky.
Sheila: Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss.
Kyle: No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him.
Sheila: Aaaaargh! Omigod, make him stop!
Gerald: AAAGGGHH!!!
Kyle: Put him down, you stupid dog!
Gerald: Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go!
Shiela: Waagghh!!
Shiela: My baby!!
Driver: Huuh?
Gerald, Sheila: Aaaggghhh! Aaagh aaagghh!
Gerald: There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do.
Father Maxi: "Yea, usher us unto the Lord", sayeth some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Kyle: Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
Kyle: What??
Kyle: You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
Sheila: What are you talking about?
Kyle: Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska!
Sheila: What-what-whaaat?!
Stan: Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
Cartman: Fireman!
Kyle: Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
Kenny: (Hey!)
Kenny: (Hey, you guys! I'm dy--)
Stan: Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Jimbo: Get outta the way, you damn hippie!
Jimbo: What?
Mr. Mackey: Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey: I can't, man. Jerry Bear's dead, m'kay?
Blonde: He-e-ey, man, I overheard what you said; that was coool!
Mr. Mackey: What? Oh, thanks, man.
Blonde: Would you like to come over to my place and finger-paint?
Sheila: Now, where did you leave him, young man?
Kyle: Aw, how the hell should I know?
Sheila: Gerald! Do something about your smart-ass son!
Gerald: Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass.
Sheila: If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!
Shiela: Ike, love?
Gerald: Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother.
Kyle: Yeah, right.
Sheila: Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.
Clerk: Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar.
Sheila: Ike!
Ike: Mamatoedoe.
Barkeep: Hey, lady, that's my table post! You can't have that!
Blonde: Let's get married and have a honeymoon in India.
Gerald: Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!
Sheila: But first, apologize to your brother!
Gerald: Apologize to him!
Ike: Uh oh, stufid.
Blonde: Wooow, this is sooo beautiful!
Mr. Mackey: Woo, whoa! Ow! Hey!
Mr. Mackey: Uh oh hel-m. Hey!
Mr. Mackey: Uh-- What the hell is going on?!
Jimbo: Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab.
Mr. Mackey: I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks!
Principal Victoria: We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help.
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need.
Mr. Mackey: I don't want help!
Principal Victoria: You'll thank us later.
Sheila: Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris.
Ike: Uh oh.
Sheila: Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray!
Uncle Murray: Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle?
Sheila: He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted.
Guest: Hi there!
Sheila: Hello. Do I know you?
Sheila: Ohhh, thanks.
Cartman: Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.
Ike: Oh deh family nrr.
Kyle: What do you want?!
Ike: I wumuh trecompr. Com. Tebruhnerr.
Stan: Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
Kyle: No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
Kyle: Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
Social Worker: You have to admit you have a problem before anyone can help you.
Mr. Mackey: But I don't think I really have a problem.
Social Worker: Nonsense! You did drugs! I suppose you forgot all about your family.
Mr. Mackey: I don't really have a family.
Social Worker: And you lost your job.
Mr. Mackey: No, I lost my job before that.
Social Worker: Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an adult.
Social Worker: The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them. There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's called college! Now, I want you to repeat after me: Drugs are bad.
Mr. Mackey: Drugs are baad.
Social Worker: Drugs are bad.
Mr. Mackey: Uhh... Dru-drugs are baad.
Sheila: Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris.
Dr. Schwartz: Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought the normal cutting device, but then I remembered that Ike was Canadian, so I brought the right one.
Where is the little rug rat?: Dialog
Sheila: Right over here.
Dr. Schwartz: Come 'ere, you.
Ike: Oowwww!
Ike: Oh deh faminrr.
Dr. Schwartz: Ike? Ike?
Ike: Heh cohcoh mondefern menurr.
Dr. Schwartz: There you are. Come on Ike, it's time.
Kyle: You stay away from my little brother!
Dr. Schwartz: Kyle... a-a circumcision is a very common thing for Ike to have. His father had it, his grandfather had it, and...
Kyle: No! No, it isn't true!
Stan and Cartman wonder.: Dialog
Stan: Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
Social Worker: Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are fully recovered.
Mr. Mackey: I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again.
Social Worker: Just one more thing.
Kyle: It's okay, Ike. I'm here.
Ike: Ouch. Amuhbuhbuhbuh.
Ike: Cookie Monster.
Stan: Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
Kyle: Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
Stan: Yeah.
Cartman: Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!
Mr. Mackey: Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life...
Cartman: Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?
Stan: You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
Cartman: No way, I set up mine first, hippie!
Mr. Mackey: M'kay.
Kyle: M'kay?
Mr. Mackey: M'kay.
Cartman: Okay?
Mr. Mackey: Okay.
Mr. Mackey: Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?
Chef: Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball!
Kyle: We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
Stan: Yeah.
Pip: Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--
Stan: Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
Pip: Oh, dear.
Stan: If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
Pip: Oh, what jolly good fun!
Kyle: No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
Clyde: Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!
Stan: Dammit, we lost one already!
Chef: Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh.
Stan: Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup.
Stan: We're losing men fast out here!
Kyle: I caught it! I caught it!
Chef: Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!
Pip: Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't.
Kyle: Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
Pip: I'm not French--
Kyle: Throw the ball, you stupid frog!
Kyle: God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,
Kyle: Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!
Cartman: Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.
Pip: Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!
Chef: That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office.
Kyle: Oh-- Noooo!
Clyde: I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
Bebe: I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
Cartman: Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?
Nurse Gollum: Are you Kyle Broflovski?
Kyle: Ye-yes.
Nurse Gollum: I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?
Kyle: Ye-yes.
Nurse Gollum: Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you.
Kyle: I know.
Nurse Gollum: So open them.
Kyle: Oh! Phew.
Nurse Gollum: Now, what seems to be the problem?
Kyle: Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
Nurse Gollum: Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack.
Kyle: AAGGGGGHHHH!!
Nurse Gollum: What?
Kyle: OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
Nurse Gollum: Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head.
Kyle: AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
Kyle: ...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
Boys: Eewwww!
Cartman: Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?
Kyle: No. No-it looked dead.
Boys: Eewwww!
Stan: Wa-was it wearing clothes?
Kyle: Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
Stan: Oh, yeah. Eeww.
Boys: Eewwww!
Kyle: And then she walked over to--
Cartman: Who the hell cares what it's called? As long as she doesn't have to touch me...
Sheila: Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys.
The Boys: Gross!
Sheila: But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached.
Stan: AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
Cartman: AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
Sheila: So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?
Kyle: Uhhhh... Yeah.
Sheila: Can you imagine that poor, poor woman?
Gerald: Mm-hmm.
Sheila: Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day...
Gerald: Mm-hmm.
Sheila: Hello?
Sharon: Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother.
Sheila: Oh, yes. Hello, Sharon.
Sharon: Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?
Stan: No! I have to get it out!
Sheila: Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.
Stan: ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
Randy: Damn it, stop.
Randy: Oh!
Randy: Damn it!
Sharon: Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead?
Gerald: Mm-hmm.
Cartman: Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
All: Awww...
Stan: Aw, do we have to?
Kyle: Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
Chef: You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!
Cartman: Heyh! They have a zoo there!
Chef: That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do!
Stan: Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
Kyle: Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
Pip: I'd love to!
Cartman: Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.
Pip: Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.
Principal Victoria: Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?
Sheila: Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
Principal Victoria: O-of course you do.
Sheila: I want to talk to you all about your school nurse.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--
Sheila: No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of.
Principal Victoria: Oh, and uh, what disease is that?
Mr. Mackey: Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia.
Principal Victoria: What's that?
Sheila: She has a dead fetus attached to her head.
Mr. Mackey: Y-you never noticed that?
Principal Victoria: No-o, I never did.
Principal Victoria: Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?
Sheila: I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
Mr. Mackey: Do we have to eat kosher stuff?
Principal Victoria: Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8:00?
Sheila: Wonderful!
Principal Victoria: Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?
Clyde: Denver?
Chef: I think we need to get off on this exit.
Mrs. Crabtre: SIT DOWN, KID!!
Ms. Crabtree: DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL?!
Chef: How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!
Ms. Crabtree: I SAID SIT DOOWWN!!!
Stan: Whoa, dude, this is a school?
Bob Thomas: Hello, there. I'm Bob Thomas, the coach for the Denver Cougars.
Chef: I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows.
Bob Thomas: Well, I certainly want to thank you for bringing your team down. Apparently, nobody else would play us, because they knew we'd just beat 'em silly. So I told the school board to find me some hick school from the mountains, and here you are.
Bob Thomas: You're from South Park, yeah?
Bob Thomas: My G-hod, amazing where people can live nowadays. Well, we might as well get this over with; we've gotta start thinking about D.C. Promise we won't make it too painful.
Referee: Play ball!
Sheila: So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?
Nurse Gollum: Colorado State.
Sheila: Ahhh.
Principal Victoria: Oh.
Gerald: Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?
Gerald: I mean, gravy.
Gerald: Ow!
Token Black: Ow!
Chef: Dammit, come on!
Chef: Somebody catch the ball!
Bob Thomas: All right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go!
Cartman: I caught it, I caught it!
Player 1: Oh, that's not fair! He's so fat, it stuck in his belly!
Referee 2: South Park on offense!
Chef: Great job, children! Just stay focused now.
Kyle: Go for it, Pip.
Pip: Oh, bother.
Kyle: Come on, you Frenchy little frog!
Pip: Gagghh!
Chef: Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip!
Principal Victoria: Eh, sooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight.
Mr. Mackey: Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?
Gerald: Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!
Sheila: Gerald!
Shiela: Keep your damn mouth shut!
Nurse Gollum: I-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really.
Nurse Gollum: No, I'm quite secure with it.
Sheila: I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
Nurse Gollum: They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand.
Mr. Mackey: Could I get some more pork?
Principal Victoria: So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?
Nurse Gollum: Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death.
Principal Victoria: Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?
Nurse Gollum: No, really, I don't need a--
Sheila: Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop.
Nurse Gollum: I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person.
Sheila: I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
Principal Victoria: Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring.
Nurse Gollum: But I really don't think--
Mr. Mackey: Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?
Chef: You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions.
Cartman: Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumb-ass European hippie piece of crap.
Kyle: Get him, Frenchy!
Pip: Gaagghh!
Referee 2: South Park wins!
Chef: We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!
Player 6: Uh-hu-hu-hu-howieee!
Player 6: It hur-hurts! Owieee!
Player 6: Mommy, it huurts! I-it hur-hurts!
Mayor McDaniels: Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals...
Mayor McDaniels: ...where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.
Mayor McDaniels: But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!
Mayor McDaniels: And now, let's kick off our week long festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!
Mayor McDaniels: Let's hear it for these brave souls!
Mayor McDaniels: What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators!
Nurse Gollum: You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job.
Chef: How much further is Washington, D.C.?
Mrs. Crabtree: SIT DOWN, KID!!
Chef: I need to know how far it is, lady!
Mrs. Crabtree: I SAID SIT DOWN!!!
Mrs. Crabtree: WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
Chef: I said, "I've always wanted to visit Prague."
Mrs. Crabtree: Oh, me too.
Kyle: Some hadka fish, some gafagga...
Stan: Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!
Stan: Places!
Ms. Crabtree: ARRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!
Kids: Whoa!
Kenny: (Sheesh!)
Chef: Damn, man. This is the big time, alright.
Stan: Chef, we're hungry.
Chef: You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese.
Cartman: My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
Chef: What?
Referee: Are you Chef?
Chef: Yeah.
Referee: The Washington team has forfeited the game. Congratulations, you're national champions.
Chef: What? We did it! Children, we won!
Kyle: Wow, that was easy.
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear a round of applause for the new national champions of dodgeball, the South Park Cows!
Kyle: Hey, why did you guys forfeit?
Player: You mean you don't know?
Kyle: Know what?
Player: Last year's national champions were the Austin Pirates. They played China for the world championship. Only four of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball players aren't like us.
Master: Bush langli. Woon taun. Waya ching gia!
Player: Well, good luck. We've got our futures to think about.
Chef: Okay, children, back in the bus.
Mayor McDaniels: And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison.
Nurse Gollum: Oh, no..!
Barbrady: Oh, that was so touching.
Mayor McDaniels: Nurse Gollum!!
Nurse Gollum: Oh, boy.
Jimbo: Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China.
Chef: Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game.
Stan: But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
Chef: Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions.
Kyle: But we could get killed!
Chef: And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?
Chef: Just imagine: a big yellow "Dodgeball Champions" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!
Stan: Dude, Chef has lost it.
Chef: You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!
Cartman: So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh?
Kyle: Dude, what does that mean?
Cartman: I dunno.
Stan: Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese?
Kyle: Yeah, you're from China.
Kevin Stoley: No, I'm from America. My parents are Chinese.
Stan: Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
Kevin: I have no idea, dude.
Cartman: Come on, rice picker!
Chef: Hey, hey hey!
Chef: Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity.
Stan: You don't?
Kyle: But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
Stan, Kyle: Ohhh.
Chinese Commentator: Hiit ita wita great pride, that huwe huwelcome ourn American friend. Now let the...
Chinese Commentator: ...champion of dodgeball be deshide!
Stan: Damn, dude. China's fucked up.
Referee: Take places!
Chef: All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!
Chinese Commentator: Okay, Tom, rooks rike A-mericans are getting ready to play. I don't suppose they'll have any problems seeing the ball with their big American eyes!
Tom: Yeah. Good thing they have those big eyes so that they don't have to rery on that amazing American interrect.
Chinese Commentator: Oh, you say such things.
Tom: That's a zinger!
Referee: Praaayyy braal!
Chef: Holy crap..!
Chef: God damn...
Chinese Commentator: Hey, hey, what do you call white American person with PhD in a physics and-a math?
Tom: Ah, I don't know. What?
Chinese Commentator: Stupid American!
Tom: Aw, no way!!
Chinese Commentator: Oooh, another American is down! It's numbuh-- uuhhh... Oh, I don't know. All American look alike!
Stan: Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Chinese Commentator: Oooh, my, I haven't seen an American die like that since Abraham Lincoln!
Tom: Dude, that is-a not cool! You're gonna get us into trouble again.
Mayor McDaniels: Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China.
Chinese Commentator: And there is-a only a one South Park prayer left.
Chinese Commentator: Still all Chinese prayer. This should be over veerry shortly.
Chinese kid: Come on! Throw ball!
Tom: Hey, you wanna hear my impersonation of American?
Chinese Commentator: Yeah, yeah!
Tom: Ah, okay.
Tom: Hey, I really, really want that. That looks good.
Chinese Commentator: Hey, hey. Let me try, let me try.
Chinese Commentator: I'll use my credit card.
Chinese Commentator: Eh-eh-uh... Do you have any non-dairy creamer?
Chef: You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good.
Chef: If we had won the world championship, what then?
Chef: Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?
Chef: Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home.
Chinese kid: Come on! Throw ball!
Player 70: "What's the matter, Frenchy? You got crepes in your ears."
Pip: Arrggghhh!
Chinese Commentator: And the winner is South Park Cows!
Pip: Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day!
Chef: Shut up, Pip.
Pip: Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--
Kids, Chef: Shut up, Pip!
Mayor McDaniels: As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation.
Mayor McDaniels: Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows!
Kyle: What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
Mayor McDaniels: And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!
Kyle: Agghh!
Stan: Dude, it's the freak nurse!
Cartman: Holy crap!
Sheila: Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!
Kyle: Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.
Nurse Gollum: Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week.
Nurse Gollum: What I really wanna say is... well, -egh-- This may sound odd coming from a woman with a fetus sticking out of her head, but... you're all a bunch of freaks!
Mayor McDaniels: Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now--
Nurse Gollum: Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out?
Nurse Gollum: I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long.
Nurse Gollum: Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other.
Nurse gollum: And take those stupid things off your heads!
Principal Victoria: Oh, my, what an ungrateful bitch.
Sheila: Yeah, the nerve of some people.
Kyle: Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
Stan: Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
Cartman: I love you guys.
Cartman: Ah, screw you guys!
Jimbo: Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.
Ned: M-hi, Ned.
Jimbo: Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?
Ms. Crabtree: BE QUIET BACK THERRE! THESE ROADS ARE SLIICK!
Stan: Hey, Cartman!
Cartman: What?
Stan: Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
Kyle: Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
Cartman: Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
Stan: Give us some, Cartman!
Kyle: Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
Stan: Dude, the road is always snowy.
Kyle: I know, but, it's really snowy today.
Stan: Shut up, Cartman!
Ms. Crabtree: Okay, that does it! Y'all be quiet or the cute little bunny dies!
Stan: Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
Kyle: Oh, she would, dude. She would.
Ms. Crabtree: GOODD!
Ms. Crabtree: OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!
Stan: Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
Kyle: Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
Ms. Crabtree: Whoa oh.
Ms. Crabtree: Hold oonn! Aaaaa!
Kids: Aaaah!
Kyle: I'm scared!
Ms. Crabtree: BE QUIET, KID!
All: Aaaah!
Guide: ...Aand right up here you can see a red-bellied chickadee. They're indigenous to this area.
The Kids: Aaaah!
Wife: What was that?
All: Aaaah-
Cartman: All done!
Ms. Crabtree: SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!
Ms. Crabtree: I SAID 'QUIET,' OR ELSE I KILL THE BUNNY!
Stan: Where are we?
Ms. Crabtree: I have no idea.
Stan: I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
Kyle: Yeah, what are we supposed to do?
Ms. Crabtree: Just keep your trap shut. I'll consult the manual.
Cartman: Ms. Crabtree?
Ms. Crabtree: SHUT UP, KIID! I HAVE TO WATCH A TRAINING VIDEO!
Ms. Crabtree: KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!
Trainer: That's right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bus driver's code: 'Sit down. And shut up!'
Ms. Crabtree: I'm goin' for help. Ah'll be back as soon as I can. Remember. Don't get off this bus, or a big scary monster WILL EAT YOU!
Kyle: 'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
Ms. Crabtree: WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
Kyle: I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
Ms. Crabtree: Oh.
Stan: Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
Ms. Crabtree: Had to happen to me, didn't it?
Truck Driver: Whoa uhih, it's supper time. Come to poppa.
Truck Driver: Whoa uh heh hello, little lady-yeh. Goin' my way?
Ms. Crabtree: SHUT UP AND HELP ME INTO THIS THIING!
Truck Driver: Whoa. Hehum huh.
Truck Driver: Uh huh. Alright, sure, of course.
Ms. Crabtree: TAKE ME TO THE NEAREST TOWN AND MAKE IT SNAPPY, YOU FREAK-ASS CRACKPOT!
Truck Driver: Uuuh, yeh, yes ma'am. Righta right away, ma'am.}
Truck Driver: So uh... Uhwhat's a- fragile little doe like yourself doin' out on a, on a night like this?
Ms. Crabtree: LOOK, MISTER, I GOT A BUSLOAD OF KIDS TRAPPED UP ON THAT PASS! I NEED A CRANE, HELICOPTERS, ALL THAT CRAP! HERE, LET ME HAVE SOME O' YOUR ASPIRIN!
Truck Driver: Uh uh- ma'am, those are actually roofies.
Ms. Crabtree: ROOFIES, ASPIRIN, RIGHT NOW I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS!
Ms. Crabtree: HOW FAR TO THE NEAREST TOOWWN?!
Truck Driver: Mm-... mm-it's a ways.
Stan: Dude!
Kyle: What?
Stan: Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
Kyle: Worse than this?
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?
Mr. Garrison: Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!
Mr. Garrison: The prank is over!
Mr. Garrison: You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch.
Mr. Garrison: God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?!
Kids: Yea--
Mr. Garrison: Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!
Kids: Awww..!
Mr. Garrison: Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!
Mr. Garrison: Okay. I'm going to turn around now.
Mr. Garrison: Shit!
Pip: Where did everybody go?
Kids: Yea!/Hooray!/Summer!
Mother: Oh golly, Kevin, honey.
Father: Good to see you again, son.
Man: Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready.
Pip: Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!
Stan: Shut up, Pip.
Pip: Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?
Kyle: What do you mean?
Pip: Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead.
Cartman: Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip!
Stan: Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
Kyle: I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
Stan: I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
Kyle: Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
Cartman: Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!
Stan: Jesus, Cartman!
Stu: Hi, fellas.
Boys: Hi, Stu.
Stu: What can I do for you?
Kyle: We wanna buy M-80s.
Stan: The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
Cartman: Okay, that's it!
Cartman: Screw you guys! I'm going home.
Kyle: What a baby.
Stan: So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.
Stu: I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?
Stan: Heard what?
Stu: All fireworks have been banned in Colorado.
Kyle: What do ya mean?
Stu: It was in the paper this morning.
Kyle: Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
Stu: Right.
Stan: How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
Kyle: Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
Stan: Oh gosh, killed Kenny!
Kyle: Oo bastards!
Stan: A summer without fireworks is like I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
Kyle: Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
Stu: I can still sell snakes.
Stan/Kyle/ Kenny: Awww..!
Officer Barbrady: Oh?
Mayor McDaniels: This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
Officer Barbrady: I found him.
Stan: Man, it's hot out here.
Cartman: What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
Kyle: Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
Stan: I know! Let's go sledding!
Kyle: Yeah!
Stan: Come on, Cartman, get on.
Cartman: Stan?
Kyle: Let's go, dude. We're ready.
Stan: What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
Cartman: Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
Kyle: Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
Cartman: Ugh... Whatever.
Stan: What the hell is going on?
Jimbo: Hey there, boys!
Stan: Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
Jimbo: How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
Kyle: Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
Jimbo: What?!
Stan: Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
Ned: Mmmm-where are we going?
Jimbo: Mxico, my amigo.
Ned: Mmmm-why are we going to Mxico?
Jimbo: To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?
Ned: Are fireworks legal in Mexico?
Jimbo: Hell, everything's legal in Mxico. It's the American way.
Charlie: At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence. Our focus is on safety while--
Mayor McDaniels: Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
Charlie: Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake.
Mayor McDaniels: Ooooh!
Charlie: We'll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake.
Mayor McDaniels: ...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time...
Charlie: Once lit, the snake will grow.
Charlie: And good times will be had by all.
Aide 1: Wonderful.
Aide 2: Spectacular.
Mayor McDaniels: Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
Aide 2: Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam?
Mayor McDaniels: Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!
Stan: Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
Kyle: Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison: Hello, children. How is your summer going?
Stan: Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.
Kyle: Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?
Mr. Garrison: Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat.
Stan: That's good.
Mr. Garrison: Mr. Hat is just a puppet.
Kyle: Yup.
Mr. Garrison: Mr. Hat isn't real.
Stan: Right.
Cartman: Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?
Stan: Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
Cartman: It is not!
Stan: Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
Kyle: Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
Cartman: I am not swimming around in pee!
Stan: Whatever, dude.
Cartman: My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.
Cartman: I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
Stan: But Cartman, we're trying to--
Stan: What does he mean, "living in denial"?
Kyle: Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
Stan: There, how does that look?
Kyle: Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
Stan: Uh, crap..!
Cartman: Eh-eh-eh-eh...
Instructor: Okay kids, everyone in the pool!
instructor: Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now.
Cartman: Nuh-uh.
Instructor: Just jump in.
Cartman: I don't wanna.
Instructor: It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it.
Cartman: Egh--
Instructor: There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us.
Cartman: Huh? First graders?
Cartman: Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!
Mayor McDaniels: Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
Aide 2: I'm sure it'll be here any second.
Mayor McDaniels: Shut up!
Aide 2: Copy that.
Conductor: Okay, children, I'm sure we're a little rusty. Where is Eric Cartman?
Stan: He's taking swimming lessons.
Conductor: Oh, dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our French horn section? Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And...
Mayor McDaniels: Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.
Mayor McDaniels: Wait a minute... It's the snake!
Officer Barbrady: Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all.
Mayor McDaniels: Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!
Jimbo: Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr.
Proprietor: Qu?
Jimbo: Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr.
Proprietor: Necesita usted un cohete grande?
Ned: Nnnn-no moleste el gato spectacularrrr.
Jimbo: Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone.
Ned: Mmmm-they're spectacularrrr.
Jimbo: Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July.
Jimbo: We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.
Ned: Hmmm-bueyno.
Mr. Garrison: Hello?
Caller (Mr. Mackey): Hello, is Mr. Hat there?
Mr. Garrison: Is this some kind of joke?
Mr. Garrison: You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!
Caller (Mr. Mackey): I don't think you can, m'kay.
Mr. Garrison: Goddammit..!
Shari Lewis: So, Lamb Chop, what would you like to do today?
Lamb Chop: Well, I'd like to sing you a song.
Shari: Hey, let's sing one to-gether!
Shari: Whoa-aagghh! Aagghh! Aggh!
Shari: No! Lamb Chop, no!
Lamb Chop: Shari, help me... It burns! It burns..!
Instructor: Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later.
Cartman: Later's fine.
Instructor: Just do your side stroke.
Cartman: I only know how to do it doggie style.
Cartman: Can I do it doggie style?
Instructor: Okay.
Instructor: That's it! That's it, you can do it!
Cartman: Sweet..!
Cartman: Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!
Instructor: Come on, Eric!
Cartman: No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
Anchor: Fourth of July is finally here, and with the state-wide ban on fireworks, people from all over Colorado are flocking to South Park. Here with a special report is a normal-looking guy with a funny name.
Creamy Goodness: Thanks, Tom. It looks like the firework ban won't be putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight. I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history.
Creamy Goodness: Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us.
Creamy Goodness: Alrighty then, looks like we're ready.
Stan: How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?
Cartman: Fine.
Kyle: I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
Cartman: Well, you heard wrong, hippie!
Conductor: This is it. And a-one and a-two and a...
Audience: Ooohhhh..!
Mayor McDaniels: What is fuck is that?!
Mayor McDaniels: Oh, hell. Light the snake!
Audience: Ooooooh!
Audience: Ahhhhh!
Jimbo:: Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.
Jimbo: I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?
Guard: Good evening, gentlemen.
Jimbo: Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland.
Guard: Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions.
Jimbo: Fire away, we have nothing to hide.
Guard: Is anyone other than the two of you traveling in this vehicle?
Jimbo: No, sir.
Guard: Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
Guard: Open your trunk, please, sir.
Jimbo: Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
Mayor McDaniels: My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.
Mayor McDaniels: Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?
Charlie: Die out?
Mayor McDaniels: Yes, you know, expire, end.
Mayor McDaniels: Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?
Charlie: Uhhh, I'm not sure; I never made one this big.
Charlie: I guess we didn't quite think this through, did we?
Mayor McDaniels: What?!
Stan: Yeah, they need to shut it off.
Man 1: Somebody stop it!
Man 2: It's out of control!
Stan/Kyle/ Cartman: Aarrgghh!!
Kyle: Kenny! Watch out!
Kenny: (Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!)
Stan: Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
Kyle: You bastard!
Mayor McDaniels: So when does it run out?!
Charlie: November. Of next year.
Mayor McDaniels: Oh, hell..!
Creamy Goodness: Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping. Residents have tried everything from fire-hoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop, but nothing seems to work.
Tom: Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future.
Stan: Man, this sucks.
Kyle: What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
Stan: We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
Cartman: Where is Chef?
Kyle: What'd he say?
Stan: Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
Cartman: Wow.
Kyle: How is that gonna help?
Anchor: All over America, the effects of the giant ash snake of South Park can be seen.
Preacher: Yea, let the spirit of Heavenly Father be blessed upon you.
Assistant: From this day on, all will be well.
New Mormon: I already feel like things are getting better.
Mr. Garrison: And I can't sleep or think...
Mr. Garrison: Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?
Dr. Katz: Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think... Mr. Hat... went?
Mr. Garrison: How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?
Dr. Katz: Well I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah.
Mr. Garrison: At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning.
Dr. Katz: Um... Ahem...
Dr. Katz: Are you gay?
Mr. Garrison: What?!
Mr. Garrison: Are you propositioning me?
Dr. Katz: No.
Dr. Katz: Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you.
Mr. Garrison: Mr. Hat, on the other hand...
Dr. Katz: Mr. Hat was gay?
Mr. Garrison: Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations.
Dr. Katz: I see.
Mr. Garrison: Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing.
Dr. Katz: That I did not need to know.
Mr. Garrison: Well, I'm just sayin'.
Mr. Katz: Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet.
Dr. Katz: What do you think about that?
Mr. Garrison: I think you're the loony one in this room.
Mr. Garrison: Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo.
Jimbo: Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again.
Ned: Mmmmmmm-yup.
Jimbo: Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.
Ned: Mmm-well better luck next year.
Jimbo: Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again.
Jimbo: No.
Ned: Mmmm-do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
Jimbo: Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?
Jimbo: Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
Ned: Mmm-it looks like my ex-wife!
Jimbo: Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!
Brett Favre: Hi. I hasn't seen you in here before.
Reporter: As more and more cities are affected by the growing ash and the death toll rises to 3,000...
Reporter: ...people from all over the country are looking to the Mayor of South Park for answers.
Reporter: ...And it appears as if the Mayor is going to explain matters now.
Aide 1: Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of South Park regrets that she cannot be here herself, but she is... sick.
Reporter 2: "Sick"?! What kind of lame excuse is that?
Print Reporter: You gotta be kidding me!
Reporter 3: Oh, this is ridiculous!
Reporter 4: Come on, we want answers.
Aide 2: Sh-she's having her period.
Aide 1: We do, however, have an official statement for all the concerned cities about the matter with the giant snake that we can't seem to put out.
Aide 2: "We're sorry. Our bad."
Aide 1: Thank you, that is all.
Cartman: Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.
Cartman: Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it.
Stan: How many days left in summer?
Kyle: A lot, I think.
Stan: Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
Kyle: I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon.
Stan: Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
Jimbo: Oh, now, why the long faces?
Kyle: We're bored.
Stan: There's nothin' to do.
Jimbo: Well, I don't think those are problems...
Jimbo: ...that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!
Stan/Kyle: Hooray!
Jimbo: Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.
Jimbo: Point 'em away from your eyes, now.
Kyle: Wow! These are huge!
Jimbo: Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child.
Stan: Hey, look! We blew up the snake!
Citizen: All the ash from the snake is putting the flame out.
Jimbo: Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!
Stan/Kyle: Hooray!
Cartman: I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.
Cartman: I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!
Cartman: Huh?
Cartman: Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..!
Citizen 2: Look! They put out the snake!
Mayor McDaniels: Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly.
Kyle: Hey, look! It's snowing!
Jimbo: Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell.
Stan: Winter's back!
Mr. Garrison: Wow, it's a black blizzard!
Kyle: Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?
Mr. Garrison: Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig.
Mr. Twig: That's right, children. I'll see you in the fall.
Stan: Well, I can hardly wait.
Chef: Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..?
Stan: Hey, Chef!
Cartman: How's it going?
Man: Howdy, Chef. How was your summer vacation?
Chef: Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!
Robert Redford: Why do we hold the Sundance Film Festival here, Phyllis? It's so painfully crowded.
Phyllis: That's not a bad idea. But where?
Man in background: Ching ching cha-ching.
Man in foreground: Whoa.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?
Mr. Twig: That's right, Mr. Garrison. The First Annual South Park Film Festival begins today.
Wendy: Wow! Cool!
Kyle: They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
Cartman: No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.
Cartman: Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!
Cartman: I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!
Wendy: Hrmph!
Mr. Garrison: Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office!
Cartman: ...bitch.
Mr. Garrison: That's it Eric, you-!
Cartman: I'm going!
Mr. Garrison: Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it.
Director 1: Norma, I want to shoot the script next month with Demi Moore instead.
Cartman: I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
Kenny: (Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.)
Kyle: Sick, Kenny.
Stan: Damn, dude. Look at all these people.
Kyle: All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
Chef: Hello there, children!
The boys: Hey, Chef.
Stan: Whatcha doin'?
Stan: Calm down, tubby.
Chef: I can just see the commercial now. "Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."
Kyle: Cool!
Woman: This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture.
Chef: Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, "Go Fudge Yourself," or my all-natural, "I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."
Woman: Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?
Chef: Huh?
Chef: Whose goose?
Woman: Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A.
Director 3: Cute sign, though.
Wendy: Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?
Cartman: She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.
Kyle: If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
Chef: Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! "I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"
Stan: When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
Wendy: Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them.
Stan: They what?!
Candice: Who are you to judge my womanly soul?
Candice: Here lies the Goddess truth of my body.
Candice: The Goddess that cries, "Freedom!"
Candice: Here is the Goddess truth of my womanly being
Candice: You are my blossom, my flame. When we make love, it's like the sun is right outside the door.
Candice's Girlfriend: Then make love to me, right now
Stan: Dude!
Wendy: Sshh!
Stan: Dude!
Kyle: I'm poopies, ma!
Sheila: Well, hurry up!
Kyle: Could it be?
Kyle: Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
Cartman: Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.
Man: Look, look! Here comes somebody!
A woman: Move aside, I can't see.
Tom: Ladies and gentlemen, TV's Fred Savage.
Tom: Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon.
Kyle: So how was that movie last night, dude?
Stan: Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!
Cartman: It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?
Stan: Yeah, pretty much.
Cartman: Yeah!
Stan: The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
Kyle: Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass.
Cartman: Ay!
Cartman: Okay, that's enough fat-ass jokes for this week.
Kenny: (Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh.)
Cartman: Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home.
Kyle: Well?
Robert Redford: This is perfect. Why didn't we think of it sooner? This town still has some charm left, not the mess we turned Park City into.
Robert Redford: Yes. And the town after, and the town after that. Like termites, we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up. And then move on, until every quiet mountain town is like Los Angeles.
Phyllis: Why? Why would we do such a thing?
Robert Redford: Waitwaitwait. Zoom in to a close-up of my face when I do that. Ready? Then NOBODY will!
Robert Redford: That's it.
Chef: Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, "Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls."
Stan: Are they good?
Chef: Try 'em.
Kyle: There it is again!
Kyle: It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble.
Stan: Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
Kyle: Where does that grill go?
Stan: To the sewer, dude.
Kyle: Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!
Kyle: Come on!
Cartman: Aw, man, smells like ass down here.
Stan: What was that?
Cartman: Aw, man, let's get out of here!
Kyle: We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey.
The boys: Aaaaah!
Kenny: (Wait!)
Kyle: What the hell?
Stan: Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison: Oh uh- hello, children.
Cartman: What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
Mr. Garrison: Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out.
Kyle: In a sewer?
Mr. Garrison: Children, do you know how to file a police report?
The boys: No.
Mr. Garrison: Good. See you in school.
Cartman: This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?
Cartman: Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home.
Kyle: Mr. Hankey!
Mr. Hankey: Howdy-ho, boys.
Mr. Hankey: Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht.
Mr. Hankey: Have you all been brushing behind your teeth?
The boys: Yes.
Mr. Hankey: And usin' dental floss?
The boys: Yes.
Mr. Hankey: And washin' behind your ears?
The boys: Yes.
Cartman: No.
Kyle: What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
Mr. Hankey: Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home.
Stan: What do you mean?
Mr. Hankey: Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem.
Mr. Hankey: These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment.
Kyle: And that's why you got a cold?
Mr. Hankey: That's why, Kyle. That's why.
Stan: Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
Mr. Hankey: There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me.
Kyle: Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys.
Mr. Hankey: Don't forget to change your sheets once a week!
Host: So without further ado we will begin this amazing film. It's a work of blood, sweat, and tears.
Director 4: Is that Leonardo DiCaprio?
Kyle: Aaahh!
Director 4: Ohuh no, wait, that's not him.
Kyle: Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
Female director: Excuse me, little boy, what's a "Mr. Hankey"?
Kyle: He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide world, and I don't want him to die.
Director 3: What a great story-it has everything!
Director 5: Great pic, son. How much do you want for it?
Kyle: Huh??
Director 7: It could be a crime-fighting rabbit. Or a lovable turtle.
Director 4: This could be a great summer movie.
Director 8: "The Mr. Hankey Stor-" uh is Harrison Ford available for a fall pic?
Director 9: Keanu Reeves.
Director 10: Matt Damon!
Fred Savage: Fred Savage!
Director 10: I'll pay two.
Kyle: Dude, no one even listened to me.
Director 3: Mmuh I take it you're part owner of this whole Mr. Hooey story, right?
Cartman: Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess.
Director 3: I want you to do a big-money deal with me.
Cartman: All of us?
Cartman: Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.
Director 3: Hm-that's great, kid. Let's make a deal.
Robert Redford: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for making the First Annual South Park Film Festival a success. We've barely even started and already the festival has seen more attendance than last year's Sundance festival.
Someone in the crowd: Fantastic!
Robert Redford: And I'm very pleased to announce that in honor of the South Park people who have welcomed us, we are going to build a Hollywood Planet restaurant, right here where this library used to stand.
Aide 2: Can they do that?
Mayor McDaniels: They're Hollywood! They can do anything!
Kyle: Mr. Hankey!
Kyle: Mr. Hankey?!
Kyle: Mr. Hankey?
Mr. Hankey: Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?
Kyle: They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
Mr. Hankey: Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out.
Kyle: It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
Mr. Hankey: But I won't last long up above.
Kyle: Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
Mr. Hankey: All right, just let me get my toothbrush.
Wendy: Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening!
Stan: Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
Tom Hanks: Mr. Hankey, I can't go on anymore. I've lost the fight.
Mr. Hankey: We started this together, we're gonna finish it together.
Tom Hanks: I always thought death was something glorious, but now I know that it's not.
Cartman: Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
Man 2: You bastard!
Kyle: Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
Kyle: Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
Mayor McDaniels: Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?
Mayor McDaniels: Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town.
Robert Redford: Uh-huh.
Mayor McDaniels: Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?
Marty: Mmp right. Two million, minus your agent's fee, minus your lawyer's fee, minus my fee, and the publicity and taxes taken out, you get three dollars! That's more than most people in your position make, trust me!
Stan: If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
Chef: I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it.
Stan: So what do we do now?
Kyle: You guys, we have to hurry!
Stan: Why?
Kyle: Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!
Kyle: Sir! Sir!
Robert Redford: Not now!
Kyle: I have to show you something.
Kyle: I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
A director: What's this?
Kyle: I want you guys to all meet my friend.
Mr. Hankey: Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.
Mr. Hankey: Clo-ser.
Kyle: Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?
Mr. Hankey: There is a-nother Sky-walk-er.
Kyle: Nooohohohohohoho-
Mr. Hankey: Wake up.
Kyle: What is it, Mr. Hankey?
Mr. Hankey: Come clo-ser.
Kyle: What is it?
Mr. Hankey: Clo-ser.
Kyle: Yes?
Mr. Hankey: Closer!
Mr. Hankey: One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture.
Kyle: Nooo!
Kyle: Nooo!
HazMat official: I'm sorry, son. Let's get him to ICU.
Stan: Okay!
Kyle: Uuf.
Cowboy: Say, Tom. Do you have any pudding left?
Tom: I ate all mine up, silly.
Cowboy: Well then, now what do we do?
Man: AAWWWW!
Wendy: Eeewww!
Stan: Sorry.
Cowboy: Well, why don't we just explore our sexuality?
Tom: Ooh, good idea. Let's.
Stan: Blaach!
Kyle: I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
Chef: Come on, Kyle. It's time to go.
Kyle: Chef, does poo go to heaven?
Chef: Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.
Chef: Come on, let's go.
Mr. Hankey: Howdy-ho.
Mr. Hankey: That was delicious.
Chef: My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!
Kyle: You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
Chef: You're daaamn right.
Cartman: Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95!
Woman: I'll take two.
Man: I'd like to pay for one.
Cartman: Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
Robert Redford: And the year after that, and the year after that, and so on! And now, release the curtain!
Robert Redford: I give you, "Hollywood in South Park!"
Kyle: Wait!
Kyle: I brought him! I brought him to show you!
Kyle: Behold! Mr. Hankey!
Mr. Hankey: Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival.
Short Man: Mr. Poo, if you wouldn't mind, we can't hear our chairman. If you could just turn yourself down. You're at about 7 right now, we need you at about, 3, okay?
Kyle: No!
Robert Redford: Now, as I was saying, this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals.
Chef: Well, it worked once before.
Stan: What the hell is he doing?
Kyle: I don't know.
Cartman: Whoa!
An Agent: Oh my God!
Man: Oh, my God, it's crap!
Man 2: Ohh! Noo!
Man 3: Whoa, it smells, it smells!
Robert Redford: Aww. Aww. Glup.
Man: Let's get out of this town!
Kyle: You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
Townsfolk: Hooray!
Mr. Hankey: I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle.
Mr. Hankey: Kisses.
Stan: Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.
Wendy: Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.
Cartman: Yes. And I've learned something, too.
Cartman: Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.
Dr. Doctor: It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.
Sharon: But what's wrong with her?
Dr. Doctor: It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?
Sharon: No, no, she's been perfectly healthy.
Dr. Doctor: Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease.
Dr. Doctor: You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes.
Shelly: Shut up, brat!
Dr. Doctor: She'll be fine.
Dr. Doctor: We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.
Stan: Ow!
Sharon: Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.
Sheila: My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.
Liane: I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
Sheila: That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.
Liane: Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.
Sharon: So it's not such a crazy idea after all?
Sheila: Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now.
Kyle: Are you guys having a meeting or something?
Sheila: How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
Cartman: No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.
Kyle: Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
Sharon: Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.
Cartman: Oh weak!
Kyle: I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
Stan: Yeah, it's pretty weird.
Kyle: Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.
Kyle: Well, here's Kenny's house.
Stuart: Yeah?
Stan: We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
Stuart: What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--?
Stuart: Oh yeah.
Stan: Catch what?
Mrs. McCormick: Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner.
Stan: Sshh! Cartman!
Cartman: What?
Kenny: (No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)
Mrs. McCormick: I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!
Kyle: Heheheh, buns.
Stuart: We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV.
Kyle: Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
Cartman: Oh, good. I'm starving.
Mrs. McCormick: Let's say grace.
All: Amen.
Cartman: Pfff..!
Mrs. McCormick: Okay, let's dig in.
Kevin: That one's mine, that one's mine!
Stuart: So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?
Kyle: I don't know.
Mrs. McCormick: Stuart, don't even get started!
Cartman: Puh! I heard that.
Mrs. McCormick: What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!
Stuart: You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.
Mrs. McCormick: Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.
Cartman: Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?
Stuart: Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole!
Kenny: (Aa-choo!)
Mrs. McCormick: Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them.
Stan: Huh?
Kyle: Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
Kyle: Cartman, what the hell is that?
Cartman: It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
Cartman: Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!
Kenny: (Uh-huh.)
Cartman: Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.
Stan: I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
Kenny: (Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)
Stan: Oh.
Kenny: (Aa-choo!)
Sharon: Okay, lemme see.
Sharon: Oh, goody! You've got a fever!
Sharon: Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright.
Stan: Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
Sharon: Oh, gee, I guess you did.
Stan: Well, you sure seem happy about it!
Sharon: All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.
Liane: Don't scratch it, hon.
Liane: Here, I got you some calamine lotion.
Cartman: I don't wanna.
Liane: It'll make your itches go away.
Cartman: Ey, give me that!
Cartman: Ahhhh...
Liane: Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.
Cartman: More calamine lotion!
Sheila: I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.
Kyle: Yeah. I feel great!
Sheila: Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
Sheila: Did you sleep in the same room?
Kyle: Yes. Why?
Sheila: Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?
Kyle: No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
Sheila: Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
Kyle: Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
Sheila: I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.
Kyle: Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
Gerald: Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.
Kyle: Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
Gerald: Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.
Gerald: You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.
Kyle: Gods and clods?
Gerald: Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.
Kyle: Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!
Sharon: Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!
Sharon: Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay.
Sharon: Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?
Stan: Okay.
Shelly: If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!
Phillip: Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities?
Terrance: Sure thing, Phillip.
Terrance: Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!
Phillip: That's tomfoolery.
Shelly: Give me the remote!
Stan: Ey! Get me out of here!
Dr. Doctor: He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while.
Dr. Doctor: There there now, it's not your fault.
Randy: Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.
Dr. Doctor: Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck.
Kyle: Could we go home now, Ma?
Kyle: But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
Kyle: What's "ookie mouth"?
Sheila: First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time.
Kyle: Sick, dude!
Sheila: No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.
Sheila: That ought to take care of it.
Mrs. McCormick: You want some more hot water?
Sheila: I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.
Mrs. McCormick: Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!
Sheila: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Sheila: Try again, bubbe!
Kyle: Argh!
Sheila: You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.
Mrs. McCormick: Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.
Mrs. McCormick: Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself.
Sheila: Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
Sheila: But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
Mrs. McCormick: Uh-I don't know.
Sheila: We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
Kyle: I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible.
Sheila: Practice makes perfect, bubbe.
Cartman: Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!
Phillip: Give it to me straight, Terrance.
Terrance: The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.
Phillip: Oh, what a relief!
Terrance: The bad news is, you have cancer.
Phillip: Cancer?
Terrance: Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.
Phillip: My ass is collapsing?
Phillip: Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
Terrance: No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore.
Cartman: No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!
Cartman: Uh. Yes. Uh...
Liane: Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.
Stuart: I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry.
Gerald: Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...
Stuart: Tackle box?
Stuart: When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless.
Gerald: Right. Right-right.
Mr. Garrison: And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?
Mr. Garrison: Yes, Kyle?
Kyle: What the hell does that have to do with American history?
Mr. Garrison: Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?
Kyle: Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
Mr. Garrison: Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, "How I would make America better."
Kyle: What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
Mr. Garrison: Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too.
Stan: Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
Sharon: Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.
Stan: That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
Sharon: Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good.
Stan: Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
Randy: Yeah, it's-it's true, he is.
Sharon: Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper.
Stan: Wait! Where are you going?
Randy: We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
Stan: Milkshakes?!
Sharon: Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.
Stan: Weak!
Kyle: "So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."
Sheila: He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
Kyle: You!
Kyle: Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
Sheila: Now, Kyle, come here.
Kyle: You get away from me, you crazy woman!
Sheila: Hoh boy.
Stuart: Beer?
Gerald: Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.
Gerald: Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?
Stuart: Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.
Gerald: Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
Gerald: Oh, right.
Stan: Yeah.
Stan: What are you talking about?
Kyle: They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
Stan: They did?
Kyle: Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
Stan: Why?
Kyle: Because they're a bunch of assholes.
Kyle: Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!
Cartman: "I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."
Cartman: Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."
Kyle: Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
Cartman: I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
Stan: Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
Cartman: She what?!
Cartman: That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
Gerald: Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.
Stuart: Not that easy. You were lucky.
Gerald: Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky.
Stuart: You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
Gerald: You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!
Stuart: Now don't make me do that again!
Gerald: Ow! You son of a bitch!
Stuart: Uh!
Gerald: Ow!
Stuart: Oh!
Gerald: Ow!
Stuart: Eeaagghh!
Randy: Doctor?
Dr. Doctor: Yes?
Randy: Wh-where's Stan?
Dr. Doctor: Stan?
Randy: Stan, our son?
Sharon: You mean Stanley's missing?
Randy: Will he be okay out of the hospital?
Sharon: Die?
Dr. Doctor: Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs.
Randy: Okay, well well, let's go look--
Dr. Doctor: As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny.
Sharon: Oh God, no!
Randy: I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
Dr. Doctor: Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--
Sheila: So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
Gerald: That son of a bitch ripped my parka!
Sheila: Catch anything?
Gerald: I just don't get it.
Gerald: Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
Sheila: Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.
Gerald: Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
Gerald: What?!
Gerald: Oh, God, what have I done?
Phillip: What's happening here, Terrance?
Terrance: We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
Phillip: Who's the donor?
Phillip: Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?
Terrance: Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass.
Chef: Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!
Kyle: Chef, we wanna know about herpes.
Kyle: Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
Kyle: Do you know anybody with herpes?
Kyle: Cool! Thanks, Chef!
Chef: O-kay!
Chef: Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
Sharon: Stanley?
Randy: Stan?
Randy: Stan?
Sharon: Stanley!
Kyle: Are you old Frida?
Kyle: Someone who wants a favor.
Kyle: Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
Stan: And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
Stan: Thanks a lot, Frida!
Boys: Hooray!
Randy: Stanley, where the hell have you been?
Stan: Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
Randy: What?
Stan: You know, freshen up your breath.
Kyle: Ugh...
Sheila: Kyle!!
Dr. Doctor: Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all.
Kyle: We're sorry.
Dr. Doctor: Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in.
Kyle: This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
Cartman: Hell no, you guys get your own!
Sharon: Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?
Stan: Pretty good.
Randy: Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?
Stan: Wow, coo-hul!
Sheila: And how are you, Kyle?
Gerald: Are you doing okay?
Kyle: I'm better now.
Sharon: What's so funny, you two?
Kyle: We gave you guys herpes.
Sheila: What-what-whaaat?! You did this?!
Randy: I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
Sheila: It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it.
Liane: Ooh, I have them somewhere else, poopiekins.
Cartman: Hooray!
Gerald: And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.
Stuart: Aww hell, I'm sorry, too.
Terrance: Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better.
Cartman: Well, I know one thing for sure.
Liane: What's that, Eric?
Stan: Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle: You bastards!
Police Commissioner: Well, detective. It looks like ya fooled them again.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, "This is not a victimless crime"? Anybody?
Mr. Garrison: Children, were you paying attention?!
Stan: Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
Mr. Garrison: Oh, and what do you consider normal?!
Stan: I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
The Class: Yeah!
The Class: Hooray!
Kyle: To where?
Mr. Garrison: To the planetarium.
The Class: AAWWWW!
Cartman: Planetariums suck!
Mr. Garrison: Oh now, what's wrong with the planetarium?
Stan: It's boring.
Kyle: Yeah, all the constellations look alike.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials.
Announcer: Hey kids, do you love Cheesy Poofs?
The Class: Yes.
Announcer: Well, Cheesy Poofs is looking for a kid to sing the happy Cheesy Poofs song. Watch for our talent van as it goes around the country.
Cartman: I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road.
Ms. Crabtree: THAT AIN'T HOW YOU DO IT! YOU DO IT LIKE THIS: SIDDOWN AND SHUT UP!!
Ms. Crabtree: THIS IS THE PLANETARIUM, WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE WAY DOWN SO AS NOT TO HURT YOURSEELF!
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves.
Cartman: Hey, there it is!
Announcer: We're going around the country to find the kid who can sing the Cheesy Poofs song better than anybody.
Cartman: I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behind my back!
Kyle: You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
Mr. Garrison: Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.
Cartman: But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
Mr. Garrison: No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on!
A Boy: Wow, don't you...?
A Girl: What is that?
Dr. Adams: Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium.
Kyle: I thought it was "plane-*tarium*."
Dr. Adams: Well, it is. But I have a bone disease which impedes my ability to pronounce the "t" in "plane'arium".
Mr. Garrison: That's a pretty weird bone disease.
Dr. Adams: Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.
Dr. Adams: Yes, little boy?
Cartman: How long is that Cheesy Poofs van gonna be outside?
Dr. Adams: Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works.
Cartman: As if we care.
Kyle: Hey, who are you?
Dr. Adams: Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us.
Missy: I love my work.
Stan: Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
Missy: I love my work.
Dr. Adams: Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we?
Dr. Adams: Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable.
Stan: This is stupid.
Dr. Adams: And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... eh-come out.
Dr. Adams: ...while these stars form the constellation, "Roger Ebert".
Dr. Adams: And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades.
Dr. Adams: Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of...
Cartman: Aw man, screw this.
Dr. Adams: And now breathe deep as the stars sloowwly start to move in little circles.
Dr. Adams: I know you think plane'ariums are boring, but I'm gonna try to change the way you think about that.
Announcer: That was great, Tommy. Tommy Fritz from Torrey Pines! He could be our winner.
Cartman: Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!
Announcer: Oh, and what's your name, little boy?
Cartman: Eric Cartman.
Announcer: Alright, here's Eric Cartman giving it a shot.
Tommy: Aaah!
Cartman: Thaat's right, suck on that.
Mr. Garrison: Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?
Kyle: Oh, man, I don't feel so good.
Stan: Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.
Kyle: Me too. It was sweet.
Mr. Garrison: Really? What did you like best about it?
Stan: I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
Kyle: Did what?
Cartman: I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
Mr. Garrison: You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
Cartman: Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!
Kyle: My head still feels funny.
Stan: Yeah, mine too.
Cartman: Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
Kyle: Like you really need it, hippo-ass!
Boy: Waaaah!
Stan, Kyle: AAAAAH!
Kyle: Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!
Stan: Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
Mr. Garrison: Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!
Cartman: Hey, be careful, asshole!
Van Gelder: Eegh! Don't take me back there!
Van Gelder: I can't... can't...
Stan: Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!
Van Gelder: Aaaagghh.
Nurse Gollum: I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down.
Van Gelder: Nno! Nnno pain killer! I'll be okay!
Mr. Mackey: Okay uh van Gelder-
Mr. Mackey: -okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay?
Van Gelder: Eh must... tell... the machine. The machine is... e-e-e-ghe gheh-
Mr. Mackey: Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal?
Principal Victoria: Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium.
Van Gelder: Haah! Planetarium!
Principal Victoria: I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.
Van Gelder: Nnaaah!
Principal Victoria: Oh, man, this is boring!
Man: Yeah, who the heck finds this stuff interesting?
Teen 1: Dude, this is totally killer.
Teen 2: I hope this goes on for like, seven months, man.
Dr. Adams: You will not remember what happened here. To remember it will cause incredible pain.
Dr. Adams: Incredible pain!
Dr. Adams: Incredible icky paaiin!
Teen 1: Dude, I'm totally tripping.
Teen 2: This is totally killer.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?
Stan: That's a haiku?
Mr. Garrison: No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school.
Stan: Oh.
Mr. Garrison: Was he on the school bus this morning?
Stan: No.
Mr. Garrison: Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?
Stan: Yeah. What's a discharge?
Kyle: Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
Stan: Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
Mr. Garrison: But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?
Kyle: I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
Mr. Garrison: Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street.
Cartman: Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams.
Mr. Garrison: Eric, where have you been?
Cartman: Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?
Stan: Where have you been, Cartman?
The Class: Whoa!
Cartman: Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?
Cartman: Apparently, only I do.
Cartman: Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion.
Stan: Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
Cartman: It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
Mr. Garrison: Very good, Kyle.
Mr. Mackey: Um. How's he doing, nurse?
Nurse Gollum: He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now.
Van Gelder: Nno! No drugs.
Mr. Mackey: Drugs are good, mkay?
Van Gelder: Nno! Don't let them g-go... planetarium!
Nurse Gollum: But why, van Gelder?
Van Gelder: The machine. The machine is aaaah.
Mr. Mackey: The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.
Nurse Gollum: He's been talking about "the machine" for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay?
Nurse Gollum: A what?
Mr. Mackey: Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope.
Nurse Gollum: Well, what will you need?
Dr. Adams: Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more.
Mr. Garrison: They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
Dr. Adams: Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children?
The Class: Yes.
Teen 1: This way, please.
Teen 2: Enjoy your visit.
Dr. Adams: Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star.
Mr. Garrison: I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
Dr. Adams: Certainly, Mr. Garrison.
Dr. Adams: You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab-
Dr. Adams: ...and right over here we see the constellation Orion.
Dr. Adams: Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsar...
Stan: Dude, what just happened?
Kyle: What do you mean?
Stan: Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
Liane: Don't pick your nose, hon.
Cartman: I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!
Liane: Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.
Cartman: I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
Poor Girl: Do you think I might win, Mommy?
Poor Mom: I hope so, honey. Then perhaps we can eat for a little while.
Cartman: Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!
Poor Mom: Come on! Perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs!
Cartman: Sike!
Stan: Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
Kyle: Sshh!
Dr. Adams: Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!
Dr. Adams: Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volunteer work here.
Clyde: Yes. Yes, please!
Butters Stotch: Me too!
A Girl: I'd like to tape the show!
Wendy: Yeah, me too! Me too!
Fosse: Yeah, me tohohoo. Plahanehetaharium's gahahay!
Dr. Adams: Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison: Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it.
The Class: Hooray!
Stan: Dude, this isn't right.
Kyle: Why?
Stan: We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
Kyle: Oh, yeah.
Stan: Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there.
Kyle: Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
Stan: Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
Kenny: (Okay. Got to have some huggin'.)
Stan: He hits this switch-
Kenny: (I don't see anything.)
Kyle: You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
Stan: Yeah, I guess so.
Kenny: (Whoa, dude.)
Kyle: What does that do?
Stan: I don't know.
Kyle: Kenny! What's it doing?
Stan: This says "maximum."
Stan: Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
Kyle: We're bastards!
Stan: Dude, I told you something was up with this place!
Kyle: We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!
Center Judge: Next will be uuh, Eric Theodore Cartman.
Cartman: I know, I know!
Cartman: Thank you.
Center Judge: We'll let you know.
Liane: Thank you.
Liane: Don't pick your nose, hon.
Cartman: I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!
Center Judge: Jesus, where do we find these people?!
Mr. Mackey: Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay?
Nurse Gollum: This is the strangest thing I've ever seen!
Mr. Mackey: Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded.
Mr. Mackey: Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.
Mr. Mackey: Yes.
Nurse Gollum: He owns the planetarium. What about him?
Van Gelder & Mr. Mackey simultaneously: He uses the machine. The star machine.
Mr. Mackey: Mkay?
Van Gelder & Mr. Mackey simultaneously: He uses it to erase minds.
Nurse Gollum: But why?
Van Gelder & Mr. Mackey simultaneously: Planetarium, about to go out of business. Adams had to create slaves to survive.
Nurse Gollum: My God! This is amazing!
Mr. Mackey: Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay?
Center Judge: Well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. Only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is Eric Cartman.
Center Judge: You were actually our last choice. Uh the other children have unexpectedly taken jobs as volunteers at the planetarium.
Blonde Judge: That's odd.
Tom: It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban.
Asian Reporter: Thanks, Tom. Yes, indeed, the planetarium has become very popular as word spreads that it really isn't as lame and stupid as one suspected. I'm here with the planetarium operator, Dr. Adams.
Dr. Adams: Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium.
Asian Reporter: So, bring the whole family to the plane-*tarium* for a night of excitement and wonder.
Stan: ...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
Officer Barbrady: That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys.
Kyle: But it's true, dude!
Officer Barbrady: Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
Stan: Yeah, pretty sure.
Officer Barbrady: Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong.
Stan: What other crime in South Park?
Officer Barbrady: Oh, yeah. Let's go.
Director: Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent?
Cartman: I'm over here.
Liane: Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy.
Cartman: Aay!
Cartman: Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
Director: Okay, roll camera, aaand action.
Liane: Oh wait, wait.
Liane: You've got a little eye booger, hon.
Cartman: Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake!
Liane: Got it.
Director: Aaand action.
Director: Hold it! Cut! Could we get some more light on that backdrop?
Stagehand: Sure thing.
Cartman: Oh, man, c'mon!
Stagehand: Got it.
Director: Okay. Here we go, aaand action.
Director: Cut!
Cartman: What?!
Director: I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes?
Cartman: Oh, God damnit!
Dr. Adams: Oh. Hello, officer of the law.
Officer Barbrady: Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator.
Dr. Adams: What brings you out here?
Officer Barbrady: Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town.
Dr. Adams: Oh, really?
Officer Barbrady: Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of.
Dr. Adams: Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time.
Officer Barbrady: Okay, I'll be quick, then.
Dr. Adams: Of course, officer. Come on in.
Stan: Oh, no! They got Chef, too!
Chef: Welcome to the planetarium.
Officer Barbrady: Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef.
Officer Barbrady: Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too.
Dr. Adams: Would you like to see the stars, officer?
Stan, Kyle: No!
Officer Barbrady: That would be super-duper!
Kyle: Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!
Cartman: Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric.
Grandma: Oh, hello, Eric. Grandma sure has missed you.
Cartman: I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.
Grandma: Oh, I will, Eric. You know, I remember when I was a little girl and had my first talent show audition for-
Cartman: Okay, bye.
The Marshes' Answering Machine: Hello? The-uh Marshes aren't in right now. Please leave a message.
Cartman: Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch.
The Broflovskis' Answering Machine: Hello, you've reached the Broflovskis. Please, leave a message.
Cartman: Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
Dr. Adams: And this is the constellation called Cassiopeia.
Officer Barbrady: Oh, neato!
Officer Barbrady: Who?
Dr. Adams: To not be Elvis will cause you great pain.
Officer Barbrady: Pain.
Dr. Adams: You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me.
Kyle: He's not highly intelligent.
Stan: Why are you doing this, dude?
Dr. Adams: Why? Because nowadays kids have computers, surround-sound television. They've forgotten all about plane'ariums. But I'll make them remember, starting with the two of you!
Voice-over: Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these announcements.
Cartman: Oh, dude, here it comes!
Cheesy Poof Cartman: Lame.
Voice-over: And now back to Terrance and Phillip.
Cartman: Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!
Mr. Mackey: Aha! Caught you red-handed! Mkay!
Stan: Mr. Mackey!
Mr. Mackey: Officer Barbrady, uh, this man is using some kind of mind control.
Mr. Mackey: Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston.
Officer Barbrady: If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?
Mr. Mackey: Uh oh.
Dr Adams: Well, let's begin, shall we?
Dr. Adams: And now you'll remember nothing, except that the planet'arium is the best thing you've ever known!
Cartman: Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!
Cartman: Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!
Cartman: You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!
Cartman: Planetariums suck ass!
Cartman: What the hell are you talking about?
Stan: Get over here and untie us!
Mr. Mackey: Eric, you really saved the day. Mkay?
Mr. Mackey: Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay?
Stan: Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
Kyle: He got a full dose of the stars.
Stan: Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
Kyle: Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
Cartman: God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!
Stan: Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.
Stan: Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.
Stan: American base is only a few feet away.
Cartman: What is this? Halt!
Cartman: It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
Stan: Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!
Kyle: Yeah! You're dead!
Cartman: I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--
Stan: No, you don't!
Cartman: --special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.
Kyle: Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
Stan: Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself!
Cartman: That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!
Cartman: What?
Kyle: Well? Now what are we going to do?
Stan: Huh-I dunno.
Wendy: Hi, Stan.
Stan: Hi, Wendy.
Wendy: Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today?
Kyle: I dunno.
Wendy: She does. She looks very pretty.
Kyle: Okay.
Wendy: Stan, can I talk to you for a second?
Wendy: Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?
Stan: ...No.
Wendy: If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace.
Stan: We could?
Wendy: Yeah, Stan.
Stan: But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.
Wendy: You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
Stan: Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
Kenny: (Heellp!!)
Wendy: Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!
Stan: Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
Kyle: We do?
Stan: We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help.
Wendy: I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend.
Bebe: I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
Terrance: Hey, Phillip, pull my finger.
Phillip: All right, Terrance.
Terrance: Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder.
Phillip: Well, all right.
Terrance: Hurgh, urgh.
Terrance: Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip!
Phillip: Okay.
Terrance: Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!
Terrance: Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-
Terrance: Caught you there!
Randy: Uh oh!
Phillip: God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!
Terrance: Yes, I sure did!
Randy: No, I was just uh flipping through the channels.
Stan: Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
Randy: Okay.
Stan: How do we do it?
Randy: Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?
Stan: Yeah, dude! How'd you know?
Randy: How do you think I met your mother?
Randy: Oh, brother.
Sharon: Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!
Randy: Yeah, Stanley, you should know better.
Stan: Dude!
Sharon: Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?
Fat Abbot: Hey hey hey. What's goin' on, Rudy?
Rudy: Man, Fat Abbot, you need to lose weight!
Fat Abbot: I'll lose weight when I feel like it, bitch! Shut yo bitchass mouth, ho!
Rudy: Bitch, I'll kick yo ass!
Kyle: Whoa, dude!
Stan: Sweet!
Fat Abbot: You think you're slick, you punkass blasphemous dope-fiend bitch! I had my jimmy whacked seven times last week! I'll bust a cap in yo nigga ass, shithole!
Kyle: Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!
Sharon: Did you find it?
Randy: Give me a second, would you?
Sharon: Don't snap at me!
Randy: I didn't snap at you.
Sharon: You snapped at me!
Randy: Whatever.
Sharon: What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, "whatever," to me!
Randy: I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry.
Sharon: I'm sorry, too.
Randy: Uh I think I found it.
Sharon: That's not it, you idiot!
Randy: Hey, back off, bitch!
Randy: Did I?
Stan: This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
Kyle: Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
Stan: Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
Kyle: Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
Stan: Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
Kyle: What? Why?
Stan: Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
Kyle: Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives!
Cartman: What are you guys doing?
Stan: We're building a clubhouse.
Kyle: It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
Kyle: Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
Stan: Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
Cartman: That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
Kyle: Fine!
Cartman: Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!
Stan: Fine!
Cartman: Fine!
Kyle: Fine!
Kenny: (Fine!)
Kyle: Fine!
Cartman: Fine! That's fine.
Stan: Fine!
Cartman: Fine!
Cartman: No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!
Kenny: (Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--)
Cartman: Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker.
Cartman: No, Kenny.
Cartman: Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!
Liane: Sorry, hon.
Cartman: Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
Liane: Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.
Liane: Well, all right.
Cartman: Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.
Kenny: (You suck ass and you suck dick!)
Cartman: And stop your bitchin'!
Sharon: What are you doing, sweetheart?
Stan: Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
Sharon: You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie!
Stan: 'Kay.
Mr. Garrison: And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?
Mr. Twig: Uh- that's right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important--
Kyle: When is Mr. Hat coming back?
Mr. Garrison: What did you say?!
Kyle: When is Mr. Hat coming back?
Mr. Garrison: I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!
Stan: But Mr. Twig sucks.
Class: Yeah.
Mr. Garrison: That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...
Cartman: So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?
Stan: Better than yours, fat boy.
Wendy: Is the clubhouse ready?
Stan: Almost.
Mr. Garrison: Stan? Are you paying attention?
Stan: Yes, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison: Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?
Mr. Garrison: ...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.
Mr. Garrison: Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh...
Kyle: Good guess, dude!
Stan: Phew.
Bebe: Pssst! Pass this up.
Butters: Pass this up.
Kevin: Pass this up.
Fosse: P-huh pass this h-up.
Mr. Garrison: Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!
Stan: No, I just--
Mr. Garrison: Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile.
Stan: I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
Mr. Garrison: Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!
Stan: But I didn't write the note!
Cartman: Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.
Stan: Shut up, Cartman!
Mr. Garrison: Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!
Stan: Oh, man.
Stan: Whoa, dude!
Mr. Mackey: Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, m'kay? Not for immature skylarkings.
Stan: What's 'skylarkings'?
Mr. Mackey: You know, like tomfooleries.
Stan: Who?
Mr. Mackey: Oh, your parents are here.
Stan: Oh, no.
Mr. Mackey: Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.
Randy: Stanley, I... Skylarkings?
Mr. Mackey: Yeahm'kay?
Randy: Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
Sharon: Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
Stan: It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
Mr. Mackey: Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder.
Sharon: You really should know better, Stanley.
Randy: You need to shape up, mister.
Mr. Mackey: Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--
Randy: Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!
Mr. Mackey: Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation's bad.
Randy: When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
Mr. Mackey: Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling.
Randy: Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.
Mr. Mackey: Mkay. That's valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--
Stan: Excuse me.
Mr. Mackey: -how do you feel?
Sharon: Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
Randy: Oh, please!
Stan: Hello?
Sharon: Oh, please yourself!
Mr. Mackey: Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?
Sharon: He is.
Randy: No, she is.
Sharon: Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again!
Mr. Mackey: Mmkay.
Cartman: Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.
Cartman: Oh, man!
Kenny: (Uh huh)
Cartman: And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Cartman: All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.
Kenny: (Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)
Cartman: Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!
Kyle: Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
Stan: I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
Kyle: To me??
Stan: I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow!
Kyle: We should use nails, dude.
Stan: My mom won't let us.
Wendy: Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?
Stan: Pretty good. We're almost done.
Wendy: Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!
Stan: We're going as fast as we can!
Bebe: Kyle, could you turn around for a second?
Bebe: Thank you.
Stan: Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
Kyle: Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
Stan: No.
Kyle: Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
Stan: I didn't even think about that.
Chef: And then, they'll ask, "Truth or Dare?'
Stan: And I say, "Dare!"
Chef: No no! You say, "Truth."
Stan: "Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.
Chef: You have to say "Truth" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager.
Stan: Oooh.
Chef: You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens.
Stan: Yeah.
Chef: Then, after a few "Truth"s, you finally answer, "Dare."
Stan: "Dare!"
Stan: Oooh.
Chef: And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
Stan: You really think so?
Chef: Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.
Stan: Wow!
Fat Abbot: Heeyy hey hey. What's goin' down, y'all?
Rudy: Man, Fat Abbot. What are you doin' on this side of the 'hood?
Fat Abbot: You know somethin', Rudy? You're like school in summertime.
Rudy: School in summertime?
Fat Abbot: Yeah, bitch, school in summertime!
Fat Abbot: Open yo' fuckin' ears and shit, ho, or I'll pop your bitch ass.
Donald: I'llba poppa yourba bitcha assa tooba, bitcha.
Cartman: What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?
Cartman: Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?
Blonde: Hi. We ran away from home.
Brunette: Well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days.
Cartman: Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
Blonde: Oh well, I guess it beats living at home.
Stan: Hello?
Cartman: How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?
Stan: We're working on it.
Cartman: Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.
Stan: No, you don't!
Stan: Dude!
Cartman: It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.
Sharon: Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out.
Stan: What?! Why?
Sharon: Because, we're divorced, Stanley.
Stan: Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
Sharon: Yeah, kind of.
Stan: ...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!
Sharon: But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy.
Roy: Hello, son.
Stan: What?!
Sharon: I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted.
Roy: Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me.
Stan: This is happening way too fast.
Roy: Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood!
Blonde: So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, "Make sure you're home before midnight!"
Cartman: Ahaw, that's weak.
Blonde: And I go, "Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!"
Cartman: That's killer.
Blonde: And she goes, "Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!"
Cartman: That's totally weak!
Blonde: So I go, "Fine! I won't come home!"
Cartman: Sweet.
Blonde: And then she goes, "Fine! Don't come home!", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap.
Cartman: Killer weak, sweet!
Blonde: I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.
Blonde: I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!
Cartman: I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"
Stan: Okay. We're done.
Stan: It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls.
Kyle: Okay.
Stan: G'oh?
Sharon: Stanley, it's time to go!
Stan: Go where?
Sharon: Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you.
Stan: But no! I have to get the girls to come-
Sharon: Come on, Stanley!
Stan: Weak!
Stan: Dad?
Randy: Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.
Randy: Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.
Stan: But I don't understand why we have to--
Randy: Well, hello, ladies.
Blonde Female Passenger: Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight.
Randy: What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.
Stan: Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
Randy: Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.
Stan: But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?
Stan: You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
Randy: Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.
Randy: Well, anyway, have a nice day.
Stan: What? That's it?
Randy: Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.
Randy: You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?
Stan: I guess, but--
Stan: Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
Kyle: Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
Stan: No way, dude! Don't be silly.
Stan: We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?
Kyle: Right. Why?
Stan: Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
Kyle: Too eager to what?
Stan: To say "Dare," dumbass! Jeez.
Stan: Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?
Bebe: Don't you guys still wanna play "Truth or Dare"?
Stan: Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.
Bebe: Then come on!
Kyle: Okay.
Bebe: Who wants to go first?
Wendy: I will. Kyle?
Kyle: Yeah?
Wendy: Truth or Dare?
Kyle: Umm. Dare?
Stan: Dude!
Kyle: What?
Wendy: Kiss Bebe on the lips!
Kyle: What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
Wendy: What's the matter, Kyle?
Kyle: It's just wrong, that's all.
Stan: Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
Kyle: What the hell have you gotten me into?!
Stan: Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
Kyle: Hoh boy.
Kyle: Sick!
Kyle: Aggghhh! Fucking sickening!
Wendy: Your turn, Bebe.
Bebe: Stan, Truth or Dare?
Roy: Son, could you please help me with the firewood?
Stan: ...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
Roy: When will you let me in? Let me love you?! Now, get your ass out here and help me.
Wendy: Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow.
Stan: Crap!
Blonde: I think you should be able to move out legally when you're fourteen.
Blonde: Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it.
Cartman: Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!
Liane: Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.
Liane: Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?
Guy in Leather Jacket: Hey, girls.
Guy with Long Hair: What's up.
Blonde: Oh hey, Scott.
Cartman: Who the hell are you?!
Brunette: Uh- we invited some people over. Hope you don't mind.
Cartman: How many people?
Bebe: Kyle, can I talk to you?
Kyle: Okay.
Bebe: Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart.
Kyle: Huh?
Bebe: I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
Kyle: Okay, that's fine.
Bebe: No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way.
Bebe: Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.
Bebe: Okay, Clyde, we can go now.
Clyde: Bitchin'.
Host: These are caf curtains that require no sewing, and I know you all love that!
Stan: Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
Roy: Nnuuhunuuhh.
Stan: What?
Roy: Chores. Do chores.
Stan: My dad lets me watch cartoons.
Stan: Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
Stan: If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
Sharon: Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, "you're the most important thing to me," what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances.
Stan: Oh.
Sharon: Bye now. Roy!
Stan: Divorce is stupid.
Fat Abbot: Heeyy heeyy heeyy! Hey Yolanda. Why is your eye all black and blue and shit?
Yolanda: Maaan, Fat Abbot. My stepdad popped me in my eye.
Fat Abbot: Stepdad? You gotta off his ass!
Yolanda: Really?
Fat Abbot: Yeah, bitch! Snatch his ass in a bear trap! Leave that motherfucker swingin' from a tree so high nobody finds him for days! Glock-glock, you know what I'm sayin'? Dumbassed motherfucker pullin' shit! Damn!
Yolanda: You're right, Fat Abbot. Thanks!
Fat Abbot: No problem, ho. Maybe later you can suck my dick, bitch-ho! Shit!
Bill: Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding.
Stan: Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy.
Older kid: Hey, kid, give me some of those!
Cartman: Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
Blonde: What? That game's for kids.
Cartman: This is bullcrap!
Randy: Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.
Cartman: This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse!
Punk: Mosh pit!
Kenny: (Huh?)
Cartman: Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle: You bastard!
Sharon: Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?
Roy: Meet me at the clubhouse.
Sharon: Oh, Randy. What are you doing here?
Randy: I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.
Sharon: Oh I thought that note was for me.
Randy: Oh, maybe it was.
Sharon: Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.
Randy: I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
Sharon: Goodnight.
Randy: Sharon?
Sharon: Yes?
Randy: Truth or Dare?
Sharon: It's too late for games.
Randy: No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?
Sharon: Truth.
Randy: Do you still love me?
Sharon: Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him.
Roy: Sharon--
Roy: Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh.
Randy: Well, you never know. Maybe--
Roy: He-
Randy: --thing will work out.
Roy: Hello?
Sharon: Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?
Roy: Sharon?
Sharon: Do me. Right here in the clubhouse.
Roy: Hello? Hel-lo? Could- could somebody get me d-? Hello?
Stan: Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
Bebe: Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
Stan: Dare.
Bebe: Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.
Stan: ...What?!
Wendy: Wow, that sucks!
Bebe: Do you think it'll hurt?
Roy: Hello? I sure am hungry. Anybody? It certainly does suck right here. Hello? Shuh- Sharon? Sharon, hello?
Host: Well, Tom and Mary, you've made it to the final round. Are you ready to play for the grand prize?
Tom and Mary: We're ready, Bob!
Bob: Any particular prize you're hoping for?
Mary: Well, Hawaii's nice, but Tahiti would be fun, too!
Tom: Oh, anywhere'd be great!
Bob: Polynesian diggities. I wish you luck. Here we go. What is the thin flap of skin that runs from the base of the penis to the scrotum?
Tom: Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this.
Mary: The upper vascular hood.
Bob: I'm sorry, but YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!
Bob: Fred tell 'em what they've won.
Fred the Announcer: Tom and Mary, put on your cowboy hats, because you're going to beautiful South Park, Colorado!
Mary: Where?
Fred the Announcer: That's right, just in time for Cows Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival.
Fred the Announcer: Every fall, South Park celebrates Cow Days, and you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at the fabulous Super 7 hotel on Bernhardt Road, and enjoy festivities, including prizes, rides, and of course, the world-famous Running of the Cows!
Fred the Announcer: Congratulations, Tom and Mary.
Bob: Well, Tom, Mary, you must be very excited.
Tom: What was second prize again?
Bob: That's all for now. See you tomorrow on...
Bob and Audience: Ooo, What The Hell Is That!
Mary: Ah shit!
Mayor McDaniels: Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!
Mayor McDaniels: As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow.
Mayor McDaniels: And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!
Jimbo: This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!
Jimbo: Which will live forever in South Park from this day forward. Release the curtain!
Mary: This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!
Tom: Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it.
Mary: Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We just need to stay positive.
Mayor McDaniels: Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
Toss-a-Ball Operator: Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes.
Kyle: Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Stan: Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
Kyle: Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.
Operator: Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.
Stan: Really?
Operator: Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves.
Cartman: Wwow!
Kyle: Dude, that kicks ass!
Operator: Five dollars for three balls.
Cartman: Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
Operator: Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth.
Cartman: That's easy!
Operator: Okay, we've got a player!
Cartman: Ay! Check it out!
Cartman: Damn it!
Operator: It's okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper.
Cartman: Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!
Kyle: You suck, Cartman!
Cartman: I'd like to see you do better!
Kyle: Give me that!
Kyle: Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
Kyle: But ih-
Operator: Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars.
Kyle: Here, give me some money, Cartman!
Kyle: Lend me money, fat boy!
Cartman: I only have three dollars left, asshole!
Kyle: Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom.
Kyle: Mom, give me some money!
Sheila: Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!
Kyle: I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Sheila: Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out on the streets!
Kyle: I will if you give me money!
Sheila: Okay, here!
Cartman: Sweet.
Jimbo: Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.
Jimbo: With that said, let's rock and roll!
Jimbo: Everybody ready to run? Release the cows!
Jimbo: They're loose!
Cows: Mooooo?!
Ned: Ow.
Kyle: Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
Cartman: I only need one, dude. I only need one.
Operator: Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts.
Stan: What's that?
Operator: Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
Cartman: How much is it?
Operator: Just three tickets, boys.
Chamber of Farts Ride: Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
Kyle: Is it like a- haunted house or something?
Operator: Sure. It's veery scary.
Cartman: Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
Kyle: No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Cartman: Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over.
Kyle: You'd better be right, dude.
Cartman: I'm right!
Operator: Keep your hands inside at all times.
Kyle: Okay.
Chamber of Farts Ride: So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS!
Cartman: Eh! God-damnit!
Stan: What the hell was that?
Chamber of Farts Ride: Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!
Operator: All right, boys. Ride's over.
Kyle: That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
Stan: Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
Kyle: That was a waste of money, Cartman!
Operator: Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets.
Kyle: We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
Cartman: Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.
Cartman: Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!
Kyle: This ride better be good!
Stan: Yeah, this line is way too long!
Cartman: I think we're almost to the end.
Kyle: We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
Stan: Here we go.
Kyle: Finally!
Line Ride Operator: Did ya enjoy the ride?
Stan: What ride?
Kyle: Yeah.
Line Ride Operator: This was the Line Ride, a real live simulator of a long line.
Kyle: Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
Line Ride Operator: That's five tickets, thank you very much.
Line Ride Operator: Come see us again soon.
Stan: My ass we will!
Kyle: Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
Stan: Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.
Photo Seller: Would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the Line Ride?
Cartman: How much?
Photo Seller: Just three dollars.
Cartman: Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet.
Kyle: You dumbass, Cartman!
Cartman: What? This is cool.
Kyle: No, it's not cool!
Cartman: It is, too!
Operator: Can I help you boys.
Stan: We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
Operator: O-kay, five dollars for three balls.
Kyle: How much do we have left, Cartman?
Kyle: How much do we have left, Cartman?!
Cartman: Aah, three dollars.
Kyle: What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
Cartman: Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.
Kyle: You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
Cartman: Ey! Seriously!
Kyle: Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Cartman: Well, I'm sorry!
Kyle: Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
Stan: Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
Operator: Sure, as long as they're good.
Kyle: Give him your food stamps, Kenny!
Kenny: (Nuh uh.)
Kyle: Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
Kenny: (Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)
Cartman: Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!
Kyle: Okay. Here we go.
Kyle: Hey! That was right on target.
Operator: Sorry, kid. Try again.
Kyle: That does it! Shenanigans!
Kyle: SHENANIGANS!
Operator: Uhwhat are you doing?
Kyle: I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
Operator: Shenanigans?
Officer Barbrady: What's all the hoo-ha?
Kyle: Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
Officer Barbrady: Why?
Kyle: This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
Officer Barbrady: If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.
Officer Barbrady: What do you have to say, carnival operator?
Operator: Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son.
Operator: Here you go.
Operator: There, you see? We have a winner!
Kyle: It worked!
Officer Barbrady: Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!
Stan: Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.
Officer Barbrady: Barbrady!
Stan: Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?
Officer Barbrady: You said Buttbaby.
Cartman: Sweet.
Operator: Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick.
Kyle: No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
Operator: Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those.
Kyle: What?!
Operator: You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade 'em in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Kyle: You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
Kyle: Damnit, I have to have those dolls!
Stan: This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
Kyle: Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
Cartman: What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
Cartman: O-kay, I'll get on the bull.
Kyle: All right! Now, come on! We have to practice!
Cartman: I guess, damn!
Mary: That ride wasn't very good.
Tom: Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time.
Mary: You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll try and have a good time.
Stan: Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
Cartman: Hey, this is sweet.
Kyle: You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
Cartman: I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
Stan: We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.
Cartman: Ye-gah!
Cartman: Ow!
Cartman: Son of a bitch!
Stan: How long was that?
Kyle: That wasn't quite ten seconds.
Stan: Damn it!
Stan: That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
Kyle: Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice!
Cartman: Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
Kyle: What'd you say, Cartman??
Kyle: I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
Rancher: Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got.
Kyle: Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
Rancher: Well, have fun, boys.
Kyle: Okay, Cartman. You ready?
Kyle: Open the gate!
Cartman: All right, get down. This is my kind of bull-ride.
Cartman: Yeah, this is sweet!
Stan: What are you going to do?
Kyle: Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball.
Stan: Oh, yeah. That's a good idea.
Cartman: Eeyy!
Kyle: That's better.
Stan: Hold on, Cartman!
Cartman: Ey! Seriously, you guys! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!
Cartman: Mother f-
Kyle: Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough!
Stan: Come on, Cartman.
Kenny: (Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)
Kyle: No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!
Kyle: Get up!
Kyle: Get UP!
Stan: You okay, dude?
Stan: Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?
Kyle: Dude, I think we broke him.
Dr. Doctor: Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma.
Stan: What's the matter with him.
Dr. Doctor: Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li.
Kyle: ..Oh.
Stan: But can he still ride a bull?
Dr. Doctor: What?
Kyle: We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
Dr. Doctor: No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep.
Kyle: Damn it!
Stan: Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?
Kyle: What the hell are you singing, Cartman?
Mr. Garrison: Eric, is there a problem?
Cartman: Yeah, I cant get this stupid song out of my head.
Mr. Garrison: "Stinky Britches" by Alanis Morissette?
Mr. Garrison: Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?
Mr. Twig: Hi, boys. How are you?
Kyle: When is Mr. Hat coming back?
Stan: But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
Kid: Yeah.
Mr. Garrison: It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--
Kyle: He'd be better used as a coat rack.
Chef: Hello there, children.
Boys: Hey, Chef.
Chef: What did you say?
Kyle: He singing some new hit song.
Chef: Eric, where did you hear that song?
Cartman: Its all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.
Stan: What, dude?
Chef: Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago.
Cartman: You wrote it?
Chef: Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.
Kyle: Wow, then you should get money for it!
Chef: Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all.
Kyle: Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
Chef: Well, all right. Maybe I will go. Ill play them my version of the song.
Chef: So you see, Mr. Big Record Producer, "Stinky Britches" was something I wrote several years ago.
Mr. Big Record Producer: Hmm I really so no resemblance between that song and "Stinky Britches" by our artist, Alanis Morissette.
Chef: Huh?
Kyle: Its the same goddamn song!
Chef: Now, look, Im trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!
Mr. Big Record Producer: I am above the law!
Mr. Big Record Producer: Mr. Chef, Im afraid you leave me no alternative. Were going to sue you.
Mr. Big Record Producer: Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. Well have the best in the business.
Kyle: Well get my dad to be Chefs lawyer!
Cartman: Yeah, and hes Jewish.
Mr. Garrison: Mr. Twig, is that you?
Mr. Garrison: Mis-Mr. Twig?
Mr. Garrison: Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!
Mr. Garrison: Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!
Gerald: Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. Were gonna bring these bastards down.
Chef: Right.
Judge Moses: This court is now in session. Who's representing the defense?
Gerald: I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski.
Judge Moses: And representing the prosecution?
Prosecutor: I am, Your Honor.
Gerald: Uh-oh.
Chef: Why "uh-oh"?
Gerald: Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O.J. off.
Chef: Uh-oh.
Mr. Garrison: I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns!
Dr. Doctor: Give the child to me.
Dr. Doctor: Uhhh...
Mr. Garrison: Is he going to live?
Mr. Garrison: ...Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!
Reporter: And so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the...day, Johnnie Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous "Chewbacca defense"?
Cartman: What's a "Chewbacca defense"?
Kyle: I don't know.
Stan: That's what Cochran used in the O.J. Simpson trial.
Cartman: Goddamn, I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, "Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"
Kyle: I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
Gerald: ...And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.
Judge Moses: Mr. Johnnie Cochran, your closing arguments.
Johnnie Cochran: Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote "Stinky Britches" ten years ago, and they make a good case... hell, I almost felt pity myself. But, ladies and gentlemen, of this supposed jury, I have one, final thing I want you to consider.
Gerald: Dammit..!
Chef: What?
Gerald: Hes using the Chewbacca defense.
Johnnie Cochran: Why would a Wookiee, an 8-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall Ewoks? That does not make sense! But more important, you have to ask yourself: "What does this have to do with this case?" Nothing.
Cartman: Wow, hes good.
Reporter: In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnnie Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense.
Reporter: Whether or it worked... is up to the jury to decide.
Judge Moses: How find you the jury?
Foreman: We find the defendant, Jerome "Chef" McElroy... guilty as charged.
Gerald: Whoops.
Chef: Whoops?!
Judge Moses: Mr. Chef, you have been found guilty of harassing a major company label. The full fee of two million dollars will be handed over within 24 hours.
Chef: Do I look like I have two million?
Judge Moses: Well, you have 24 hours to find it, or else you have to go to jail. For eight million years.
Bailiff: Uh, it's actually for four years.
Judge Moses: Oh, sorry. You'll got to jail for four years.
Chef: This can't be happening..!
Stan: Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
Mr. Big Record Producer: And that chair, too. I want that chair.
Chef: Hey, that's my favorite chair!
Mr. Big Record Producer: You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too.
Stan: Hello there, Chef.
Chef: Hey, children.
Kyle: What's going on?
Chef: Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with two million, I'm going to jail.
Stan: Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
Kyle: Yeah. Ready, Cartman?
Cartman: Ready.
Chef: Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better.
Stan: You do?
Chef: Sure. Just please stop.
Kyle: What's that, dude?
Chef: This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.
Kyle: Did you ever know any famous people?
Chef: Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.
Cartman: What's that?
Chef: Nothing.
Chef: Anyway--
Mr. Big Record Producer: Take this, too.
Chef: Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!
Mr. Big Record Producer: I can take whatever I want.
Chef: But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!
Mr. Big Record Producer: I am above the law!
Mr. Big Record Producer: I told you not to mess with me.
Chef: That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that two million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!
Mr. Garrison: Aaaggghhh!!
Mr. Garrison: Who did this?!
Mr. Garrison: You won't get away with this, you bastards!
Stan: Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
Chef: Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them.
Kyle: You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
Chef: I appreciate that, children, but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do.
Chef: My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.
Chef: Wish me luck, children.
Stan: We've gotta help him, dude.
Kyle: Yeah, b-but how?
Stan: Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
Kyle: Whoa, dude, this house is huge.
Stan: Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.
Cartman: No, it isn't, you guys.
Butler: Can I help you?
Cartman: We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.
Cartman: Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
Kyle: Are you Elton John?
Bulter: No, Im one of his butlers.
Kyle: Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.
Hi, are you Elton John?: Dialog
Kyle: We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
Cartman: We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies...
Elton John: I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan.
Cartman: What?!
Stan: Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
Kyle: Yeah, dude.
Stan: Wow, you remember him?
Elton John: Of course. I haven't seen him for so long. I remember when I first met him. It was about 25 years ago.
Elton John: I was a struggling musician who couldn't get a break.
Man: Boo!
Chef: Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up.
Elton John: Thanks, Chef. I just don't understand what my music is missing.
Chef: Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics.
Elton John: I really thought I had it this time with "Cheddar Cheese Girl".
Chef: What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.
Elton John: That's a great idea!
Chef: And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know, some slick glasses and shit.
Elton John: And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never have had a career in music.
Stan: So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
Elton John: Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums.
Cartman: Three Crispy Yum Yums.
Stan: Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
Elton John: Tell Chef I said hi.
Stan: Thanks, dude.
Kyle: Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
Sheila: Oy..! Thank you, Chef.
Chef: No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?
Sheila: Oh, of course!
Sheila: Here you go.
Sheila: Leaving so soon?
Chef: I have a loooooong way to go to raise the kind of money I need.
Sheila: Well, best of luck to you, then.
Gerald: How was it, honey?
Sheila: Pretty much what I expected.
Stan: Hello, are you Meat Loaf?
Meat Loaf: Yeah. What the hell do you want?
Cartman: Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.
Kyle: Hes not dying, Cartman!
Meat Loaf: What's this for?
Stan: Our friend, Chef.
Meat Loaf: Chef's in trouble?
Kyle: Yeah. Do you know him?
Meat Loaf: Do I?
Cous-Cous: Nobody came again.
Chef: There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image.
Cous-Cous: What do you mean?
Chef: Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name.
Cous-Cous: Beefy? Like, uhh Tri-tip!
Chef: That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf.
Meat Loaf: I owe everything to Chef.
Stan: Wow! So you'll help him?
Meat Loaf: You bet. Give me a box of Nilla Yum Yums and a couple of Berry Bars.
Boys: Cool!
Ms. Crabtree: All right, let's get this show on the road! Come here, baby!
Chef: Uh-uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree. How would you like to use some... sex toys?
Ms. Crabtree: Sex toys? Like what?
Chef: Like this very special device.
Chef: I call it "Chefs pleasure bag".
Ms. Crabtree: How does it work?
Chef: Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure.
Ms. Crabtree: Really? Well, hell, let's give it a shot.
Chef: Ahh, yeah. That's much better.
Rick James: Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give me a box of those Choco-Numbers.
Kyle: Gosh, thanks, Rick James.
Mayor McDaniels: Ohh, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show.
Mayor McDaniels: Oh, come on, buck up, little fella.
Chef: I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it.
Mayor: Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp.
Mayor McDaniels: Aw, hell!
Mr. Garrison: Thank you for coming, Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady: What's this all about?
Mr. Garrison: What?
Officer Barbrady: Can I go now?
Mr. Garrison: YesYes, Im sorry.
Mr. Garrison: Mr. Hat!
Stan: Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
Chef: It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail.
Stan: No, you don't!
Chef: Huh?
Kyle: We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
Chef: Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?
Kyle: Cartman?
Cartman: Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated hyeeah.
Kyle: But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
Chef: I made about $410,300, but--
Mr. Big Record Producer: That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!
Stan: You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
Mr. Big Record Producer: I am above the law!
Officer: All right, you, it's time to go.
Chef: Goodbye, children. Thanks for all your help.
Officer: Let's go.
Chef: Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!
Officer: I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine.
Chef: Ow! Ow!
Kyle: Dude... Chef is gone.
Stan: No more Chef.
Stan: We can't let him down, you guys.
Stan: Dude, it's over. He's gone.
Stan: No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
Cartman: Four.
Kyle: But what are we gonna do?
Stan: It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.
Kyle: Chef Aid?
Stan: Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
Kyle: Hey, that's a great idea!
Cartman: Yeah!
Mr. Garrison: Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left.
Mr. Garrison: I'm not going to take you back.
Mr. Garrison: You can just go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
Mr. Garrison: You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!
Mr. Garrison: ...I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!
Mr. Garrison: What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
Dr. Doctor: It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it. We had enough.
Mr. Garrison: What do you mean?
Barbrady: I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake.
Mr. Garrison: What? Jail?
Kyle: Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
Elton John: Howdy ho, boys.
Stan: Elton John! What are you doing here?
Elton John: It occurred to me that you might need some more help raising money for Chef.
Stan: Boy, do we!
Elton John: So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over.
Kyle: Wow, cool!
Elton John: I see you've got a stage all set up for us.
Stan: Yeah, dude, it's all yours.
Elton John: Then, lets rock and roll! Or something similar.
Cartman and Kenny: Hooray!
Mr. Garrison: ...And Mr. Twig is at home, he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history.
Chef: You finally snapped, huh, Garrison?
Mr. Garrison: What?
Chef: Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies.
Chef: What?!
Teen MC: Okay, thanks for coming to Chef Aid, everybody! Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?!
Teen MC: Whoo!
Chef: No, Garrison! Shut the hell up!
Mr. Garrison: That's good.
Chef: What the?
Mr. Garrison: Oh, boy, we're free!
Mr. Garrison: Wow, what a daring rescue.
Mr. Garrison: Mr. Hat! Mr. Hat saved us, Chef!
Mr. Garrison: Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat.
Chef: How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?
Teen MC: Rick James, ladies and gentlemen!
Rick James: God bless you, Chef!
Teen MC: And now here's your favorite band, Primus! Whoo!
Les Claypool: We're damned proud to be here to support our good buddy, Chef. It was Chef who told us in the early days, to keep trying and to keep pursuing our dreams, no matter how much we sucked. I love that man.
Mr. Mackey: Whooaa..!
Mr. Big Record Producer: What are you bastards doing?
Kyle: We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
Cartman: Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
Mr. Big Record Producer: Oh, yeah? Well just see about this!
Teen MC: And now, heres Joe Strummer! Whoo!
Joe Strummer: You know, when The Clash were on tour and we lost the beat, Chef would be like at the side of the stage going, "Don't forget, pump your loins, children." You know, that was like his motto or something.
Teen MC: Whoo!
Chef: What the hell is this?
Everyone: Welcome to Chef Aid, Chef!
Stan: Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
Chef: Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?
Kyle: Well, we helped.
Stan: Were gonna raise your money, Chef.
Chef: I dont believe it!
Mr. Big Record Producer: Well just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts.
Teen MC: And now, here he is TV's Ozzy Osbourne!
Ozzy Osbourne: We're all here to help our good friend, Chef, who has touched our lives in the past.
Ozzy Osbourne: I remember when I was just starting out, Chef suggested I buy a pompadour hat. I thought he said, "Bite the head off a bat", so I did. And the rest, oh, it's just history. Now, let's go crazyyy!
Ozzy Osbourne: Aarrggghhh!!!
Kenny: (All right dude, let me go now!)
Stan: Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kennys head off!
Kyle: You bastard!
Teen MC: And now heres Ween!
Dean Ween: We're thrilled to be part of Chef Aid.
Gene Ween: Chef was the guy who told us to do a country album.
Dean Ween: No, dude, that was Steve's idea.
Gene Ween: Oh. Then who's Chef?
Dean Ween: I don't know, dude. I thought you knew him.
Gene Ween: Oh, well. Anyways, here's our song!
Mr. Garrison: Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you.
Mr. Garrison: It doesn't matter. He left me.
Mr. Twig: Did you love him?
Mr. Garrison: Yes.
Mr. Twig: Then run to him.
Mr. Garrison: But I feel like I'm making the wrong decision.
Mr. Twig: Love isn't a decision, its a feeling. If we could decide who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical.
Mr. Garrison: I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you.
Teen MC: And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John! Whoo!
Elton John: Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a very special little boy. I have no idea what his name is, but who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend.
Kyle: Hey, that's your song for Wendy!
Cartman: Ha-ha, you're a wuss.
Producer: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win!
Narrator: And what happened then? Well, in South Park they say...
Narrator: Johnnie Cochran's heart grew three sizes that day.
Chef: You will?
Johnnie Cochran: I will.
Producer: No!
Johnnie Cochran: We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer.
Johnnie Cochran: Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey.
Reporter: Chef, how does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song, "Stinky Britches"?
Chef: It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children.
Reporter: So, what are you gonna do now?
Chef: Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
Stan Kyle and Cartman: Hooray!
Announcer: The following program is brought to you in spooky vision. Be warned: all scenes will be accompanied by pictures of Barbra Streisand.
Stan: I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
Kyle: He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
Cartman: Hey guys. How's it going?
Kyle: Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
Stan: Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
Kyle: Did you eat too many pork rinds last night?
Stan: What?
Cartman: I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed
Cartman: I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
Kyle: What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
Stan: Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
Stan: Dude, this is creepy.
Sharon: Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo.
Aunt Flo: Hello, Stanley. Remember me?
Sharon: Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice.
Aunt Flo: Hey, Stanley. I brought you and Shelly presents.
Stan: Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo!
Aunt Flo: Okay, Shelly. This one's for you.
Aunt Flo: It's a television/CD player/surround sound home theater.
Stan: Wow!
Sharon: What do you say, Shelly?
Shelly: Thank you, Aunt Flo.
Sharon: Okay, Stanley. Your turn.
Aunt Flo: Your very own fish.
Shelly: What do you say, Stanley?
Stan: I don't know.
Shelly: Okay.
Sharon: How do you like your fish, Stanley?
Sharon: Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room.
Stan: Do I have to?
Sharon: Yes, you do!
Stan: Damn it!
Sharon: Language!
Kyle: Where have you been, dude?
Stan: Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.
Kyle: Aunt Flo?
Stan: Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
Kyle: Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
Stan: Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
Kyle: Here he comes.
Stan: Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
Kyle: Well, at least he's back to normal.
Stan: Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
Stan: Why do you keep saying "hella", fatass?!
Kyle: That's not cool!
Cartman: You guys are just hella jealous.
Randy: Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
Stan: Can you leave the light on, Dad?
Randy: Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.
Stan: I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
Kenny: (Ow, mom!)
Kenny: (Uh huh.)
Sharon: Stanley, settle down!
Stan: Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!
Sharon: Uh, no problem, Aunt Flo.
Aunt Flo: Do you not like your goldfish?
Stan: No!
Stan: Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-
Aunt Flo: Look at you, with your little shovel. Just like when you were twelve.
Sharon: Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley.
Stan: But MOM!
Stan: MMOOMM!
Kyle: It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
Kenny: (Uh huh!)
Kenny: (It's the only thing I could afford.)
Cartman: It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!
Kyle: God, will you shut up?!
Stan: Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
Kyle: Yeah.
Stan: Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
Kyle: You seem tired, Stan.
Stan: I haven't been sleeping well.
Kyle: Why?
Stan: My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
Kyle: Hoh, that sucks, dude.
Cartman: Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.
Kyle: Cartman?
Cartman: Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!
Stan: What are you doing?!
Cartman: What do you mean, what am I doing?! I'm just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.
Cartman: Why the hell not?!
Cartman: I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Evil Cartman: It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
Cartman: Dude, this is hella weird.
Officer Barbrady: Well, there's been a report of a few missing people.
Sharon: Is that so?
Officer Barbrady: No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?
Sharon: Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
The Boys: Hey, Chef.
Chef: All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.
Kyle: Uh, Chef?
Chef: Or haaauuunted hash browns.
Kyle: Chef.
Chef: And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!
Kyle: Chef.
Kyle: Chef!
Chef: What?!
Kyle: We have problems!
Chef: Well, what's the first problem?
Stan: Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
Evil Cartman: I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too.
Chef: Exactly what do you remember?
Evil Cartman: Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car.
Chef: Of course! That's it!
Stan: What?
Kyle: Will you stop saying that word?!
Stan: Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
Chef: Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!
Evil Cartman: This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef.
Chef: How do you mean?
Evil Cartman: In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman.
Kyle: Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
Stan: Cartman!
Cartman: Dude, this is hella cool.
Stan: Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
Aunt Flo: Let's see. I believe it was called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store," just outside of town.
Stan: Where?
Stan: That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
Cartman: Who's "we"? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!
Evil Cartman: I'll help you, Stan.
Cartman: Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!
Kyle: Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
Kyle: Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
Evil Cartman: Can do!
Evil Cartman: I don't see any pet stores called "Indian Burial Ground."
Cartman: Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
Kitty: Meow.
Mr. Kitty: Meow.
Sharon: Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
Stan: Yeah, my goldfish-.
Sharon: Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.
Stan: I know.
Clerk: Can I help you boys?
Stan: I wanna return a fish.
Kyle: What?
Stan: Yeah, dude.
Kyle: Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"
Clerk: Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it.
Stan: So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
Clerk: Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.
Stan: Why?
Clerk: Why? I don't know. I was drunk.
Clerk: We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
Clerk: Well, that certainly would explain a lot.
Kyle: Like what?
Randy: Sharon?
Sharon: Yes, hon?
Randy: There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
Randy: What is it?
Sharon: I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.
Randy: Oh. Uh, well, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?
Stan: Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
Cler: I can't give you your money back.
Stan: I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
Clerk: No! I won't take it back!
Clerk: All right, you win.
Kyle: You kick ass, evil Cartman!
Stan: Yeah!
Evil Stan: He was here! Cartman was just here!
Clerk: Who are you?
Evil Kyle: We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?
Clerk: I don't know who you mean?
Clerk: No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
Stan: I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
Evil Cartman: Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest.
Kyle: Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.
Evil Cartman: Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever!
Stan: You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
Kyle: Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella."
Kyle: Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
Evil Cartman: Let's use Kenny's squash.
Stan: Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
Evil Stan: Aha! There you are, Cartman!
Cartman: P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?
Evil Kyle: We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes!
Cartman: Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
Evil Stan: What the hell's goin' on?! Cartman never hits us!
Cartman: Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!
Evil Stan: Yes!
Mayor McDaniels: And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! "The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats"
Evil Cartman: Hooray!
Mayor McDaniels: You boys win the Halloween Chocolate Ball!
Kyle: Stop saying "hella," Cartman!
Kyle: Leave him alone, butthole!
Evil Kyle: Shut your trap, kid!
Cartman: Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!
Mayor McDaniels: Oh, what now?!
Evil Stan: The gingerification gun!
Cartman: All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!
Cartman: What?!
Both Cartmans: I am!
Stan: Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
Kyle: Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
Cartman on Left: Time is running out. You'll have to destroy us both.
Cartman on Right: What?!
Cartman on Left: It's the only way you can be sure. We have to both go, for the good of the world.
Cartman on Left: How did you guys know?
Kyle: Oh no, dude!
Stan: You tricked us, Cartman!
Kyle: Damn it!
Randy: I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.
Officer Barbrady: Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.
Randy: Uuuh, do you want your pants back?
Sharon: The answer is "no", Stanley!
Stan: But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
Sharon: I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays.
Stan: But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
Sharon: I'll leave it up to your father.
Stan: I don't want your lame-ass supper!
Shelly: Ew! You're gonna get it now.
Sheila: It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.
Liane: Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.
Kyle: That's nice, Cartman.
Kenny: (Okay)
Cartman: Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.
Stan: 'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!
Stan: So, how far is it to Nebraska?
Liane: Around six hours.
Kyle: Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
Liane: Well, I've got an idea. We could sing.
Cartman: Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?
Liane: Over the meadow and through the woods
Kyle: Please stop.
Liane and Cartman:: Through white and drifted snow
Stan: That's okay with us.
Kyle: Yeah.
Clyde: Yeah, we don't care.
Cartman: Yeah, that's fine.
Mr. Garrison: Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Token, you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek.
Mr. Garrison: There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
Tweek Tweak: I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!
Stan: Dude, we can't work with this kid.
Tweek: Yuh-ugh!
Stan: No.
Mr. Garrison: Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!
Tweek: Wagh!
Richard Tweak: Hello there, customer.
Customer: Hello. How are you today?
Customer: I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation...
Richard: Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling.
Richard: Oh, forget it, my store is not for sale.
Richard: Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me.
Postum: Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you.
Postum: Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it!
Richard: Hi, Officer Barbrady.
Barbrady: Who was that?
Richard: Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you.
Officer Barbrady: The usual.
Richard: Bye-bye.
Stan: Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
Stan: Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about.
Tweek: Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!
Stan: Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
Tweek: The gnomes!
Stan: What?
Stan: What gnomes?
Tweek: The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants.
Kyle: Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Stan: Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.
Tweek: They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.
Kyle: Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
Tweek: No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
Richard: They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money.
Richard: I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip.
Mrs. Tweak: Oh, hello, son. How was your day?
Tweek: UUuuUunh!
Mrs. Tweek: That's good. Who are your little friends?
Tweek: What do you mean?!
Kyle: We're his oral report buddies.
Stan: Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
Mrs. Tweak: Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later.
Kyle: Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
Mrs. Tweak: Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh.
Stan: 'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
Richard: Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses?
Mrs. Tweak: Richard!
Richard: No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery.
Tweek: Mwaaah! Slavery?
Richard: Yes, slavery.
Richard: They really have my balls in a salad shooter.
Kyle: We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
Stan: Yeah.
Tweek: Uunnnnhh!
Kyle: Come on, you guys! We better get to work!
Richard: Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject.
Mrs. Tweak: Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds.
Richard: Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea.
Stan: Kind of bitter.
Tweek: But we'll starve and die like dogs.
Cartman: Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?
Kenny: (Fuck you!)
Cartman: Heheh, you suck, Kenny.
Kyle: Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
Stan: Aooooo!
Kyle: Woohoo!
Kenny: (Let me try! Let me try!)
Stan: Yeess, this stuff rocks!
Kyle: Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!
Kyle: Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
Tweek: I just have grounds.
Kyle: Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!
Kyle: Hogh, my stomach hurts.
Stan: Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.
Stan: Bad!
Richard: Oh, do you need some more coffee?
Boys: Eugh.
Richard: Well, boys, uh. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you.
Tweek: There they are!
Aussie: I've got to be careful. So, what I'm gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my thumb in its butthole.
Stan: Holy crap. dude!
Stan: This guy rules!
Kenny: (He actually killed it!)
Stan: Yeah!
Cartman: Come 'ere, crocky.
Stan: Dude!
Stan: Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!
Kenny: (You bastard!)
Stan: Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
Kyle: You guuuys!
Kyle: I think so. Is Cartman up there?
Cartman: I'm right here, Kyle.
Kyle: Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
Stan: Can you climb back up, dude?
Kyle: I don't think so.
Stan: Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
Cartman: Screw you, hippie!
Kyle: Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
Stan: All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this?
Both: AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Kyle: Dude, it's a dude!
Stan: He's like, some frozen guy.
Kyle: Wow. Cool.
Cartman: Aww, screw you guys anyway!
Stan: Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
Both: Hooray!
Cartman: For what?
Stan: Where shall we bring it?
Stan: I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
Kyle: No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
Kyle: What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
Stan: You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
Kyle: Kenny, who found the ice man?
Kenny: (Well, I think you guys should name it Steve.)
Cartman: I think we're almost there, you guys.
Mayor McDaniels: Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say "yippee."
Some people: Yippee.
Mayor McDaniels: All those opposed, say "nay."
Other people: Nay.
Stan: Huh, excuse me?
Stan: I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
Mayor McDaniels: What the hell is going on here?
Kyle: We came for our reward.
Cartman: Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.
Mayor: Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.
Dr. Mephesto: Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him.
Stan: Really.
Kyle: Sweet. How about Steve?
Dr. Mephesto: Steve it is.
Stan: Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
Officer Barbrady: Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here.
Reporter: What about the prehistoric ice man?
Reporter: The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurassic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street.
Dr. Mephesto: That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy.
Dr. Mephesto: Ugh? What's this?
Mayor McDaniels: Holy crap! He's alive??
Mayor McDaniels: Well, you just can't let him die.
Dr. Mephesto: Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.
"Steve": Uh, ughn.
Reporter 1: What?
Reporter 2: What's he saying?
Reporter 3: Is that English?
Dr. Mephesto: What? You're, you're hungry?
"Steve": Where am I?
Dr. Mephesto: You're, you're hungry?
"Steve": What's goin' on?
Dr. Mephesto: Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to. Mah-phehs-to.
"Steve": Huh?
Stan: Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.
Kyle: Gorak's a gay name.
Stan: No, it isn't!
Kyle: Why are you being such a dick?
Kyle: Nuh-uh!
Kyle: I'll go.
Cartman: Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!
Kenny: (Blue.)
Dr. Mephesto: Steve. You-
"Steve": Where am I?
Stan: Oh my God, they revived Gorak.
Kyle: You bastards!
Dr. Mephesto: Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying.
Stan: Uh, hi.
"Steve": Hi.
Stan: He said, "hi."
Dr. Mephesto: Very interesting.
"Steve": Where am I?
Dr. Mephesto: What??
Stan: He wants to know where he is.
Dr. Mephesto: Tell him, tell him he's... home.
Stan: You're... home.
Dr. Mephesto: In the year 1999.
"Steve": It's 1999??
Dr. Mephesto: He's been frozen for the last 32 months.
Stan: Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.
Dr. Mephesto: And we found you-
"Steve": What? Thirty-two months?!
Dr. Mephesto: All right, all right, all-
Dr. Mephesto: All right, all right, calm down.
"Steve": Whoa, oh.
Kyle: Good job, dude! You freaked him out!
Cartman: Sweet.
Cartman: Killer.
Cartman: Fine.
Dr. Mephesto: The same.
Agent: We understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996.
Dr. Mephesto: That's right.
Dr. Mephesto: Oh? Where are you gents from?
Agent 2: We are from the University, of... America.
Agent: Habitat?
Agent: Amazing. He looks so much like us.
Dr. Mephesto: Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing:
Agent: Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific study is expensive. We want to help you make this project more... lucrative.
Agent: It's easy.
Dr. Mephesto: As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers.
Stan: He doesn't look very happy in there.
Kyle: No, he sure doesn't.
Stan: I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
Kyle: Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!
Aussie: This grizzly bear has the strength of over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really pissing him off right now.
Agent: How so?
Dr. Mepehsto: He's changing the channel. Something on the television could frighten and confuse him.
Sports Reporter: And they've done it! The Atlanta Falcons are going to the Super Bowl!
"Steve": What?!! Rrrowrrr!
Stan: Let him out, dude. He's scared.
Agent: He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now?
Kyle: But it isn't right!
Agent 2: Little boy, sometimes, what's right isn't as important as what's profitable.
Stan: I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
"Steve": Wow. That's really nice of you, kid. Thanks!
Stan: What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
Kyle: His name is Steve!
Stan: His name is Gorak!
"Steve": My name is Larry.
Kyle: Steve!
Stan: Gorak!
Kyle: Steve!
Stan: What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
Kyle: Does so!
Larry: Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?
Stan: I found him, I'm rescuing him!
Stan: You're a dick!
Kyle: You're a dick!
Stan: You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
Kyle: You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
Stan: Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!
Larry: Arrrggh!
Dr. Mephesto: He's gone! The ice man has broken out!
Dr. Mephesto: He must have used this... door.
Dr. Mephesto: We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world!
Agent: Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't be able to use him for our military war-
Agent 2: Sshhhh!
Agent: Right.
Mephesto: What?
Agent 2: What?
Agent: Nothing.
Dr. Mephesto: No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what?
Agent 2: Dr. Mephesto, where could the creature have gone?
Dr. Mephesto: I have no idea!
Woman: Can I help you?
Leslie: Husband? You're not my husband.
Larry: Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years?
Leslie: It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about.
Larry: So you... remarried.
Leslie: Yes, Lorry.
Larry: Larry!
Leslie: Uh, larry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on.
Larry: Didn't anybody send out a search party?
Leslie: We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace.
Larry: Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused.
Cartman: Well, I don't see any crocs out here.
Stan: Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
Stan: You suck as a best friend, Cartman!
Cartman: You son of a bitch cat!
Stan: Wow, that sucks, dude.
Larry: Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over.
Stan: What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
Stan: Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!
Kyle: Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
Kyle: Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
Larry: They're coming for me!
Cartman: Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face.
Dr. Mephesto: Was the ice man here?
Cartman: He might have been, by crikey.
Agent: We have to get him back. Well, can you do it?
Cartman: Wow! Kick ass!
Stan: We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
Clerk: Des Moines? What the hell for?
Kyle: We have to get our friend, Steve-
Stan: My friend, Gorak!
Kyle: -to Des Moines, or else he's gonna melt away.
Kyle: Frosty, Steve, whatever.
Clerk: Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat.
Stan: Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.
Larry: Okay, boys. Thanks.
Kyle: Okay. First one to die, loses.
Stan: 'K.
Stan: O-okay.
Cartman: Yeah, I think the same thing.
Agent: Well, where the hell is he? We've got to get him back to the lab.
Dr. Mephesto: He can't function out here in our time!
Cartman: Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.
Aussie: Wait! Look!
Dr. Mephesto: Is it him?
Dr. Mephesto: Does he always do this?
Stan: Watch my coat, dude.
Kyle: Oh.
Larry: I have to go to Platform B.
Clerk: What the hell are you talking about?
Dr. Mephesto: An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?!
Larry: Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys.
Kyle: Later.
Larry: You boys have really shown me the true meaning of friendship. You didn't care about anything but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about.
Stan: Yup.
Kyle: Uh huh.
Larry: After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world!
Kyle: Cool.
Larry: Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends!
Stan: His... name... is... Gorak!
Kyle: His name... is Steve!
Dr. Mephesto: We've got to stop it!
Agent: We've gotta stop that train!
Kyle: Steve! Steve, look out!
Stan: They're after you!
Aussie: Oh, he's a wily one!
Larry: Oh, poo!
Kyle: Steve, look out!
Conductor: Hey, who are you?
Agent: I said, stop that train!
Conductor: Yes, hello. I see you.
Cartman: They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
Aussie: Now for the coup de gras. I'll just... get my... thumb up... here.
Agent: Where's the ice man?!
Dr. Mephesto: He has to be around here somewhere.
Kyle: I can't believe he's gone.
Kyle: Hey!
Stan: He's alive!
Dr. Mephesto: No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll never live!
Agent: What? Nothing!
Stan: Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
Kyle: No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
Kyle: Me too. He sucks.
Cow: Moo!
Cartman: Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.
Cartman: Okay.
Choir Teacher: Children, we are a national choir called, "Getting Gay With Kids!" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!
Choir Teacher: So, who wants to join the fun??
Cartman: What if you don't have any rhythm?
Choir Teacher: Excuse me?
Cartman: Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
Kyle: Shut up, fatass!
Stan: Choirs suck.
Mr. Garrison: All right, that does it!!
Craig Tucker: I know.
Mr. Mackey: Why cant you behave?
Craig: ...I dont know.
Craig: No.
Craig: No I didnt.
Kyle: Hey, Craig.
Eric: Ey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch!
Mr.Mackey: Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-
Stan: It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, young man, "Getting Gay With Kids" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors.
Kyle: Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use pre-recorded tapes.
Mr. Mackey: Well, guess what, boys? I think that "Getting Gay With Kids" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you.
Stan: What?!
Mr. Mackey: And that's exactly why you need to go!
Sheila: Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.
Choir Teacher: Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints.
Sheila: Oh, I didn't realize.
Choir Boy: Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?
Choir Teacher: Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest.
Cartman: Whoopee.
Choir Teacher: And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
Cartman: Yeah, pretty much.
Choir Teacher: Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo.
Kenny: My names Kenny.
Kelly: Lenny?
Kenny: No, Kenny.
Kelly: Johnny?
Kenny: KENNY!
Choir Girl: Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography.
Cartman: Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
Choir Teacher: Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S.
Choir Teacher: Eric, sit down!
Middle Prostitute: Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?
Choir Teacher: Eric, SIT DOWN!
Choir Teacher: Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-
Kelly: Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?
Choir Teacher: You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-
Cartman: I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
Choir Teacher: Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?
Cartman: Why?
Choir Teacher: Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
Cartman: Eh-heheh!
Choir Teacher: Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow.
Choir Teacher: Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?
Choir Teacher: Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.
El Presidente: O! O! Save The Rainforest.
Choir Teacher: Yeess!
Mr. Mackey: Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour.
Choir Teacher: All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin.
Kenny: Yeah, I think so.
Choir Teacher: Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle.
Kyle: Thanks!
Cartman: I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
Kyle: Fuck off, Cartman!
Stan: No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
Pablo: This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.
Choir Teacher: Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!
Kyle: God-damn, it's hot out here!
Kyle: No, dude. That's a branch.
Kyle: No. That's the same branch again.
Stan: Oh.
Choir Teacher: Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!
Kids: YEAH!
Choir Boy: I wish we could have seen the Yanogapa.
Kyle: What's the Yanogapa?
Choir Teacher: The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!
Choir Teacher: Stanley, what is it?
Pablo: What's the matter, little boy?
Cartman: Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!
Stan: Dude!
Kyle: My guess would be yes.
Kelly: That's good. Can I tell you something?
Kenny: Okay.
Kenny: Really?!
Kenny: Oh, that's great!
Choir Teacher: Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!
Choir Teacher: Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?
A Boy: Im not.
Choir Teacher: Who's not?!
A Boy: Me.
Stan: Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!
Choir Teacher: No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley.
El Presidente: Qu tal? Est todo bien? (Oh hello. Is everything going okay?)
Mr. Mackey: Uh, muy bien. Seor Presidente, um... Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)
El Presidente: QU?! (WHAT?!)
Mr. Mackey: Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)
El Presidente: Est bromeando, Mackey?! Ms de cien mil personas atenderan este evento!!! Y me dice usted que no tendr a mis chiquitos lindos para que les canten?! (You've got to be kidding!! I have over a hundred thousand people coming to this event!!! Are you telling me that I have no darling little kids to sing to them?!)
Mr. Mackey: Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah lleg- llegran. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)
Kyle: Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
Kelly: We are?
Choir Teacher: Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us.
Kyle: Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
Kyle: Um, no.
Kyle: Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
Miss Stevens: Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-
Solider: Qu?
Stan: I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
Cartman: Y taco.
Kyle: I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
Cartman: Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
Stan: This doesn't look very safe.
Kyle: Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
Miss Stevens: Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts.
Peoples Army Leader: We're not getting gay with any kids, okay?
Miss Stevens: Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?
Kyle: Hey!
El Presidente: Donde putos est el coro?! El espectculo comienza pronto! (Where the hell is our choir?! The show is supposed to start soon!)
Mr. Mackey: No se preocupe, mbien? El Presidente, estran aqui. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)
Miss Stevens: Hello?? Anybody?? Help??
Jake: Aaaah. Ugh, help!
Kenny: Well, I like you-
Short Reporter: We're here live in San Jos, Costa Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans have gathered for the Save the Rain Forest summit. Everyone is here so they can feel good about themselves, and act like they aren't the ones responsible for the rainforest's peril.
Slim Reporter: That's right, Bob, and of course the main attraction today is the darling kids' choir, "Getting Gay With Kids," all of whom must be backstage preparing at this very moment.
Miss Stevens: Eric, where are you going?
Cartman: I'm going this way!
Miss Stevens: Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!
Miss Stevens: Young man, I have had it!!
Stan: Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
Kyle: Yeah. It happened once before.
Miss Stevens: No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
Foreman: What are you doing here, little boy?
Cartman: I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
Foreman: Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others?
Fireman: Oh my God! Get this child some food, quick!
Foreman: Chicken wings!
Crowd: Start the show! Start the show! Start the show!
El Presidente: La gente est ansiosa. Dentro de poco, se alborotan y empiezan a tirar chorchadas. (The activists are getting anxious. They will start throwing things soon.)
Mr. Mackey: Estoy seguro que llegran. Eh-solo poquito mas de tiempo, mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time)
Mr. Mackey: Mbien.
Yanogapa 1: Damtili?
Yanogapa 2: Damtili?
Stan: Jesus Christ!
Kyle: What the hell?
Stan: We're sinking.
Stan: All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!
Kyle: Yeah! Fragile my ass!
Kelly: Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!
Foreman: Quick! Everybody help the children!
Stan: Wow!
Kyle: Dude! Bulldozers rule!
Kids: HOORAY!!
Miss Stevens: How did you know where we were?
Foreman: Your little friend helped me out.
Miss Stevens: Eric?
Miss Stevens: What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment?
Foreman: We're clearing out big sections of the rainforest for a lumberyard.
Foreman: You mean, you don't mind?
Miss Stevens: Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing!
Foreman: Thats swell!
Kelly: Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day.
Stan: Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
Kyle: You bastards!
Kelly: Who's "they"?!
Kyle: They're... they're bastards.
Kelly: Well don't just stand there, help him!!
Kyle: What?
Stan: Help ...him?
Kyle: Whoa, dude!
Male Activist: That was so inspiring.
Female Activist: What a wonderful message.
Kyle: No, I don't think so.
Kyle: No, that's a hair dryer!
Manager: May I help you find something?
Kyle: Yeah. Do you have any "nurections"?
Manager: Any what?
Kyle: I need to get a nurection for my dad.
Stan: That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
Kenny: (I know, fucking seriously!)
Kyle: I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
Kenny: (Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)
Cartman: Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
Kenny: (Yeah, dude. She saved me.)
Cartman: Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
Stan: Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle: You bastards!
Cartman: What the hell happened to him?
Stan: He just... ignited.
Blond Man: I've heard about this. This is... spontaneous combustion. But it usually only happens to fat people near open flames.
Man 2: Is it contagious?
Woman: Am I going to spontaneously combust?
Man 3: I hope it doesn't happen to me.
Woman: This is very scary.
Mayor McDaniels: The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
Randy: ...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist.
Mayor McDaniels: Right.
Randy: Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.
Crowd: Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
Man: We love you, Randy.
Randy: Wow.
Mayor McDaniels: Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!
Randy: Or else what?
Stan: Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
All: Amen.
All: Lets go
Priest Maxi: Broncos
All: Broncos
Priest Maxi: Lets go Broncos
Priest Maxi: Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately.
Kyle: Well, I'm Jewish.
Priest Maxi: You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you?
Kyle: I guess not.
Priest Maxi: Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night?
Stan: The what?
Priest Maxi: It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ.
Kyle: Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!
Priest Maxi: Huh?
Kyle: We'll do it! We'll do it!
Kyle: Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
Stan: I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.
Tom: Good night, Jerry.
Jerry: See ya, Tom. Bye, Helen.
Jerry: Oh my God, another one.
Tom: Helen, no!
Jerry: What happened?
Stan: Dad, where's our Bible?
Randy: Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.
Stan: Or else what?
Randy: Exactly.
Stan: ...What?
Randy: Right.
Kyle: He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
Randy: New girlfriend?
Stan: Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
Stan: Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
Kyle: This is gonna be fun.
Cartman: I'm gonna be Jesus!
Kyle: You're too fat to be Jesus!
Kyle: Stan should be Jesus.
Kyle: You're such a fat baby!
Kyle: All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
Kenny: Uh, no.
Stan: Come on, Randy. You said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight.
Randy: No! Has she been doing anything odd?
Townsman: No, she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house.
Randy: Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
Randy: No! I think I might have it.
Priest Maxi: Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little "nervous" about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh?
A few people: Yeah.
Crowd: Awww.
Stan: Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
Cartman: Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
Crowd: Awww.
Someone: Phew.
Stan: Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
Cartman: Peter!
Kyle: I don't know you, dude.
Cartman: Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
Mayor McDaniels: Mayor.
Mayor McDaniels: Why?
Liane: You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.
Liane: You're not fat, you're big-boned.
Optometrist: Hello, Eric.
Dr. Lott: How's my little piggy today?
Dr. Lott: I just say that because you're my little buddy.
Cartman: I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
Cartman: Yes.
Dr. Lott: All right, read them out for me.
Cartman: Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
Cartman: They look exactly the same.
Cartman: I don't know, two!
Cartman: Uh, one.
Cartman: Ow! I hate you!
Kyle: I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
Stan: Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.
Cartman: My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
Kyle: Why?
Cartman: Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
Stan: Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
Cartman: Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
The Boys: Hey Chef!
Mr. Derp: It's time for lunch-e-roo
Stan: Where's Chef?
Mr. Derp: Chef quit.
The Boys: What?!
Kyle: Mr. Derp?
Stan: Why did Chef quit?
Mr. Derp: Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp!
Stan: Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
Stan: Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.
Chef: Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.
Kyle: Yeah, but we didn't believe them.
Chef: Well, it's true.
Stan: But why? Why would you quit?
Stan: So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
Chef: No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked.
Stan: Talked?!
Chef: Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.
Chef: Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.
Chef: Children, Veronica is moving in with me.
Chef: I'm in love.
Boys: Love?!
Stan: What the hell is going on?!
Chef: Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
Kyle: But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
Chef: Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.
Veronica: What's the problem?
Cartman: My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
Kyle: That bitch!
Stan: She's stealing Chef from us.
Kyle: He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
Kyle: Yeah, so?
Stan: ...Yeah, screw that bitch.
Cartman: Bitch, I hate that bitch!
Kyle: Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
Stan: Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
Kyle: Good idea.
Dr. Lott: All right, we got the test results back, piggy-
Dr. Lott: You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
Cartman: So, what does that mean?
Dr. Lott: It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better.
Dr. Lott: I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses.
Cartman: I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
Cartman: Ow! Son of a bitch!
Kyle: Dude! Just take them off!
Receptionist: Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?
Stan: We wanna talk to Chef.
Receptionist: Chef?
Kyle: He's a big guy, with a beard.
Stan: And a chef hat.
Kenny: {And a real huge dick.
Receptionist: Oh! The black guy!
Stan: Huh?
Receptionist: Wow! You really got fat.
Cartman: Ey!
Chef: Hello there, children.
Kids: Hey, Chef.
Chef: Eric, you got glasses!
Stan: Chef, you have to dump the bitch!
Chef: Huh?
Kyle: We need you, Chef.
Kyle: Chef, this place isn't you!
Chef: Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.
Stan: But we don't like her.
Chef: Why not??
Stan: I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.
Kyle: No way, dude!
Cartman: Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.
Chef: That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
Cartman: Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
Chef: You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?
Kids: Okay!
Kyle: Chef should be here any minute.
Chef: Oh! Uh, hello there, children.
Kyle: All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
Chef: Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot.
Cartman: Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?
Stan: Oh no! No nononononono!
Chef: My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too.
Kyle: Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?
Mr. Garrison: Sure.
Stan: Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.
Kyle: All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
Mr. Garrison: Oh, the old succubus syndrome.
Stan: What's a succubus?
Mr. Garrison: A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.
Kyle: That's it!
Stan: Yeah!
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love.
Kyle: This is totally what's happening!
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say "get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!"
Kyle: Thanks, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Hat: You're not fooling anyone!
Mr. Garrison: Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!
Kyle: Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
Liane: There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.
Cartman: Oh, no!
Liane: Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
Cartman: Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.
Liane: Now, hon.
Cartman: But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
Chef's dad: Hello there, children.
Stan: Who are you?
Chef's dad: I'm Chef's father. We just flew in for the wedding.
Kyle: Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
Stan: Chef, we have to talk to you!
Chef's dad: Well, aren't you crackers just cute as the dickens?
Stan: You're Chef's parents?
Chef's mom: Yes, all his life.
Chef's dad: Well, he should be out now directly.
Chef's mom: Oh, he's so excited about the wedding now.
Chef's dad: Say, would you crackers like to hear about the time we saw the Loch Ness monster?
Stan: No, that's okay.
Chef's dad: Ooh, it must've been about seven, eight years ago. Me and the little lady was out on this boat, you see, all alone at night, when all of a sudden this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the paleolithic era, comes out of the water.
Chef's mom: We was so scared, Lord have mercy, I jumped up in the boat and I said "Thomas, what on earth is that creature?!"
Thomas: It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-
Chef's mom: Oh, it was so scary!
Kyle: What's tree-fitty?
Thomas: Three dollars and fifty cents.
Chef's mom: Tree-fitty.
Stan: He wanted money?
Thomas: That's right. I said "I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!"
Chef's mom: I gave him a dollar.
Thomas: She gave him a dollar.
Chef's mom: I thought he'd go away if I gave him a dollar.
Thomas: Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!
Cartman: Hey! You son of a bitch!
Thomas: And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-
Nellie: August.
Thomas: August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-
Nellie: And she was so adorable, with the little pig tails and all.
Thomas: And she says to me, "How would you like to buy some cookies?" And I said "Well, what kind do you have?" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-
Nellie: Raisin oatmeal.
Thomas: Raisin oatmeal, and I said "We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?" And she looks at me and she says, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty."
Nellie: ...Tree-fitty.
Thomas: Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.
Nellie: The Loch Ness monster.
Nellie: Lord, he was angry.
Thomas: Damn right, I was angry!
Nellie: Not you, the monster. He was about to kick your ass.
Thomas: Aah, shut your mouth, woman!
Stan: Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?
Cartman: That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
Stan: Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman.
Cartman: Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?
Stan: Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.
Veronica: Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie.
Veronica: Huh?
Stan: We know what you are, lady!
Kyle: Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
Veronica: A what?
Stan: A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
Stan: I guess.
Cartman: What? What happened?
Chef: It's okay, pop.
Thomas: Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, "Poppa, poppa!" I said "What do you need, Chef, my boy?", and he said, "...I need about tree-fitty."
Nellie: ...Tree-fitty.
Nellie: Oh, it was scary!
Chef: What?!
Stan: Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
Stan: Chef, but-
Thomas: So I chased the monster down the street, you see...
Kyle: I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
Stan: No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
Stan: Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
Kyle: Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."
Kyle: I don't know.
Stan: Right.
Kenny: (And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)
Stan: Yeah?
Kenny: (That's what that means!)
Stan: Oh-hoho!
Stan: That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
Kyle: He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
Stan: God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.
Cartman: I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
Nellie: We had taco salad that night.
Thomas: Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, "What do you want from me, alien?!" and do you know what he said?
Nellie: Tree-fitty.
Thomas: Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, "tree-fitty." And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!
Nellie: I had just given him tree-fitty the week before.
Thomas: What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!
Stan: Bitch.
Kyle: Dirty bitch.
Priest Maxi: Do you, Chef, take this woman as your lawful-wedded wife, to have and to-
Chef: Iii do!
Nellie: Aaah, my baby's getting married!
Priest Maxi: And do you, Veronica, take Chef to be your daddy?
Veronica: I do!
Priest Maxi: And now a special sharing of vows through song.
Veronica: There's got to be a morning after. [the needle is removed and there's no more music]
Stan, Kyle: -the to on- [the tape balks and reverses to a halt]
Man: Oh my God!
Women: Oh my God!
Thomas: She's a goddam Succubus!
Stan: Come on Cartman!
Stan: Oh my God! She killed Kenny!
Kyle: You bastard!
Chef: Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream.
Cartman: What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
Chef: Hello there, children!
Stan, Kyle: Hey, Chef!
Chef: How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots?
Kyle: It's great to have you back Chef!
Dr. Lott: Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes doing?
Cartman: After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
Dr. Lott: I don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes.
Dr. Lott: Was he an organ donor?
Cartman: Eh-sure.
Stan: Where are you going?
Cartman: I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
Kyle: Just go behind a tree.
Cartman: I have to go number two.
Stan: So? You can poo in the wilderness.
Cartman: No way, dude! What would I wipe with?
Kyle: Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
Cartman: Well what do I sit on?
Stan: Not here! Go further away!
Cartman: Stop, you guys! I can't think!
Stan: Sick, dude!
Tweek: Arrh! No, I'm not!
Tweek: Arrrrh!
Mr. Adler: That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?
Craig: No.
Craig: No.
Mr. Adler: Yes, you did!
Cartman: Told ya!
Stan: Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.
Wendy: I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.
Stan: I don't know. He's such a wuss.
Stan: No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
Cartman: Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
Kyle: Do you wanna bet?
Stan: How much?
Cartman: Five bucks.
Stan: You're on!
Stan: Hey Tweek.
Stan: Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
Stan: Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?
Tweek: Why?
Craig: He did?
Cartman: Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
Craig: Why would he say that?
Cartman: I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
Kyle: There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
Stan: He's really got it out for you, dude.
Tweek: Why?! What did I do?!
Kyle: So, do you agree to fight him after school?
Tweek: I guess so.
Stan: Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!
Stan: The bell rang. Can we go?
Mr. Adler: Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed.
Stan: This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
Cartman: You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
Kyle: We'll see!
Cartman: Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
Kenny: (Hey guys, what's going on with you?)
Stan: How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
Bebe: Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow.
Annie: Bye, Kenny.
Clyde: Hey, what's going on?
Kyle: Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
Kyle: What?
Token: Yeah, they left.
Stan: Aw, hell!
Cartman: Those sons of bitches!
Clyde: I guess they don't wanna fight.
Stan: Tweek?
Stan: How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!
Tweek: Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
Kyle: Well, Craig showed up.
Tweek: He did?
Stan: Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"
Tweek: I don't have crooked teeth!
Stan: Yeah, it was weak.
Tweek: I'm not a chicken!
Stan: Tomorrow?
Tweek: Okay.
Cartman: Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
Craig: What?! What did he say about Stripe?!
Cartman: Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
Craig: That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!
Cartman: Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?
Richard Tweak: How was school today, son?
Tweek: Errh!
Richard Tweak: That's great.
Tweek: Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??
Mrs. Tweak: Well what, honey?
Tweek: Nrr. What happened?
Richard: Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something.
Craig: Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow.
Thomas Tucker: With who?
Craig: Some kid.
Thomas: Oh.
Laura Tucker: Don't just "Oh" him, Thomas!
Craig: Yeah, don't just "Oh" me!
Mr. Adler: Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later.
Pearl: Richard, aren't you going to invite me in?
Mr. Adler: Why?
Mr. Adler: Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on.
Pearl: Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why?
Pearl: We'll use plastic wrap.
Stan: Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.
Clyde: Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?
Crai: I uh...
Kyle: He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
Cartman: Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
Kyle: Shut up, fatass!!
Clyde: Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight.
Bebe: What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?
Cartman: When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
Kyle: That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
Cartman: Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
Clyde: Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!
Mr. Adler: Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago.
Clyde: What? She die or something?
Clyde: Oh boy! Here we go!
Kyle: Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
Wendy: Oh cool!
Kyle: Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
Cartman: You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
Stan: Well?
Cartman: Come on!
Wendy: Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!
Stan: Huh?
Cartman: What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
Tweek: How?
Kyle: How??
Craig: I've never been in a fight before.
Tweek: Me neither.
Tweek: Like what, then?
Wendy: Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!
Stan: All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
Stan: Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
Stan: Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
Kyle: Fine!
Cartman: Fine, that's fine!
Jimbo: Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing.
Tweek: Rrrrh!
Jimbo: You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
Ned: Mmrr I can still kick ass.
Jimbo: Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you.
Tweek: Uugh!
Tweek: Ow!
Stan: Damn it!
Kyle: Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
Ned: AAAAaaaarrgh.
Ned: Ow.
Stan, Kyle: Hooray!
Tweek: Rrrr!
Jimbo: Now THAT'S BOXING!
Craig: Meatloaf?
Master: The object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. Is opponent ready?
Master: Body rike a stone! Mind rike a meatroaf!
Craig: Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!
Master: Fight back! Resist the ass!
Craig: How can I resist an ass so great?
Master: It is only an ass. You must overcome the ass with your mind.
Cartman: I win!
Master: There is indeed great power in your ass, Eric. Perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession.
Bebe: I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
Kenny: (I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)
Pearl: Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you.
Kenny: (Why?)
Pearl: Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good.
Kenny: (You don't?)
Pearl: No. I think you should consider transferring to shop class.
Bebe: Come on! It's time for the fight!
Kyle: Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.
Tweek: Hrrr.
Kyle: This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
Tweek: Rrrr, mean, rrrr.
Cartman: The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
Craig: Okay.
Cartman: Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
Craig: Okay, okay!
Stan: You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
Craig: Respect my authority.
Stan, Kyle: Come on, Tweek!
Cartman: Come on, Craig!
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school.
Kyle: About what?
Cartman: When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.
Cartman: Are you okay, Salma Hayek?
Polly: Yes, but I need to get out of here and eat some tacos and burritos. Me gusta tacos mucho!
Rumpertumskin: You cannot stop me, James West!
Liane: I have to leave soon, Eric.
Cartman: But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek.
Liane: Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly.
Shelly: Okay.
Liane: All those other babysitters won't come back.
Shelly: I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time.
Liane: Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears.
Shelly: Bears?
Liane: Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.
Kitty: Meowrowr!
Cartman: No, Kitty! I don't have anything!
Cartman: What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!
Liane: Be good.
Cartman: Aw, Ma.
Liane: Eskimo kisses for Mom-my!
Shelly: My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!
Cartman: You're not allowed to have people over!
Shelly: ...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w-
Cartman: Ey! I need to use the phone!
Shelly: I placed his underwear over his head.
Dude: Hey there, is Shelly around?
Cartman: Who the hell are you?
Dude: I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot up your ass if you don't tell me where Shelly is!
Cartman: You know this guy?
Cartman: Christ, he's like 50 years old!
Cartman: Dude, that's not cool.
Shelly: You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!
Skyler: Ye Yeah-ha.
Shelly: No, Skyler. Quit it.
Skyler: Come on, babe. How long have we known each other?
Shelly: Eight days tomorrow.
Skyler: And I still don't get any action.
Shelly: I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all.
Skyler: But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.
Shelly: Well, maybe just one kiss.
Skyler: Beat it, chubby!
Shelly: Go on, Astroturd!
Cartman: I'm gonna tell my mom on you.
Shelly: Turd Rock From the Sun!
Cartman: Ey! You ate all the pizza!
Shelly: Guess again, Richard the Turd!
Cartman: Give me that phone number!
Kitty: Meow.
Shelly: You're such an amazing poet, Skyler.
Skyler: I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar.
Shelly: Wow!
Skyler: When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff.
Shelly: What the-?
Shelly: Open this door, Turdledove!
Cartman: I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
Cartman: Oh! God dammit!
Shelly: Who is that?!
Shelly: Skyler, your band can't practice here.
Cartman: Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
Shelly: We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
Cartman: What?? Ih- is she okay?
Shelly: Not really. She's dead.
Shelly: HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!
Cartman: Aw, man, you guys suck.
Skyler: Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly.
Cartman: You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
Kitty: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Skyler: Ey, shut up, tubby!
Kitty: Meow?
A cat: Meow.
Kitty: Meow?
A cat: Meow.
Kitty: Meow?
Skyler: Yah, dude, that was hot. This guitar rocks, man! It rocks! What do you think, Shelly?
Shelly: Honestly? I think you guys need some work.
Mark: Oh, really?!
Shelly: I just think your sound is kind of... last week.
Jonesy: Oh, I'd like to see you do any better, bitch!
Skyler: O-kay, why don't you sing it for us?
Shelly: Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed!
Skyler: Hey man, don't be shy.
Cartman: Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!
Liane: No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors.
Liane: This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up.
Shelly: In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!
Mark: You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!
Jonesy: Yeah, dude. What the hell is wrong with you, anyway? She's like, 12.
Oragne cat: Rowr!
Shelly: We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!
Cartman: Okay. See you in a while.
Shelly: Wha-?
Cartman: Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly.
Shelly: What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!
Cartman: Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
Shelly: What?! No you don't!
Shelly: ...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us.
Cartman: Yuh, you mean it?
Shelly: But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!
Shelly: Shut up, turd!
Cartman: That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
Shelly: What are you doing?
Shelly: Go away, turd!
Skyler: Yeah! Come on! Give it up!
Shelly: No.
Skyler: Give it up, babe!
Shelly: NO!
Skyler: Come on, babih!
Skyler: Why the hell not?!
Skyler: You're not putting out for me?
Shelly: No!
Skyler: Well then, screw you, bitch! I've got plenty of other girlfriends that will!
Shelly: What?? But I thought you liked me.
Cartman: Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
Shelly: Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.
Cartman: You're not ugly.
Shelly: You don't think so?
Cartman: Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
Shelly: Huh?
Cartman: If you want, I could help you.
Shelly: Really? You would do that?
Cartman: Just let me get my cowboy hat.
Skyler: What the hell is this?!
Cartman: We don't have much time!
Shelly: This won't take me long!
Cartman: Hurry up in there!
Shelly: I'm almost done.
Skyler: Hello-o? Hello-o, Mrs. Hayek?
Polly: Over here! Please help me! I am lost and I have no clothes!
Polly: I'm over here! Please help me! I will reward you greatly!
Skyler: Right here, Miss Hayek!
Polly: Oh, please help me!
Cartman: That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
Shelly: They're having a cat orgy!
Cartman: You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!
Shelly: Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
Cartman: Yeah. I think we get along okay.
Shelly: No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.
Shelly: Wow, she passed out.
Cartman: Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.
Shelly: Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay.
Stan: I don't want to go to this stupid party!
Randy: Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.
Randy: Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.
Mr. Mackey: Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm.
Randy: Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him.
Mr. Mackey: Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement.
Stan: Awww!
Randy: Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.
Randy: We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.
Sharon: You have fun, Stanley.
Pip: Cheerio, Stan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here.
Stan: Shut up, Pip.
Butters: Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.
Stan: Butters, is there any way out of here?
Dougie: I like math.
Stan: Oh my God.
Pip: We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
Stan: No.
Mr. Mackey: Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.
Sharon: Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol.
Randy: One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.
Randy: Yeah, experiment.
Dougie: What are you? A sourpuss?
Butters: Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.
Butters: No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.
Stan: Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!
Mr. Mackey: Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week.
Gerald: Wow, neat!
Sheila: It looks quite inviting.
Mr. Mackey: Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub.
Sharon: Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut.
Randy: Hell, we should get in.
Gerald: Yeah.
Mr. Mackey: Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?
Sharon: Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear.
Sheila: No hot tub for me!
Pip: Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?
Butters: Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?
Dougie: How should I know?
Pip: Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.
Pip: Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?
Butters: Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
Stan: Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.
Pip: Oh, that's a splendid mission!
Dougie: Which Angel am I again?
Randy: Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?
Gerald: Yeah, I know what you mean.
Randy: I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.
Randy: Good idea.
Gerald: What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
Gerald: Yeah! ...Was that your leg?
Randy: Huh? Oh, you mean, this?
Gerald: Yeah.
Randy: Yeah. That, that was me.
Pip: Bosley! Bosley!
Pip: Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
Stan: What the hell do you want?!
Pip: Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs.
Butters: Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.
Pip: So Bosley, what's our next mission?
Stan: We're going upstairs.
Butters: Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
Randy: Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.
Gerald: She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
Randy: O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.
Gerald: I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
Randy: You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.
Gerald: You haven't?
Gerald: Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy.
Randy: Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?
Gerald: NO, no, uh I don't think so.
Randy: ...Well it is a night for experimenting.
ATF lead: This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there.
Barbrady: What?
Barbrady: Are you sure?
Barbrady: So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
ATF lead: Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them.
ATF lead: What's the situation?
ATF lead: Any luck talking to somebody in the house?
ATF agent: We've tried calling, but there's no answer. I think we're gonna have to move in, sir.
ATF lead: Alright. Johnson!
ATF lead: I'm sending you in. Watch your ass.
Pip: We did it! Great job, Angels!
Butters: So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?
Pip: What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?
Butters: Well, hooray!
Gerald: Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?
Randy: No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?
Gerald: Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.
ATF lead: Damn it, where is Johnson?!
ATF agent: No communication, sir. It doesn't look good for him.
ATF lead: Those bastards!
Man: Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much.
Mr. Mackey: Well, are you sure you have to leave so early?
Woman: We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again.
Man: What?
Agent 1: ...I did.
Agent 3: Yeah, they moved alright.
Jimbo: Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year.
Burly man: Eh that's true, but Elway was the heart of the team. Who's the leader now?
Blond man: I think the Jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the AFC.
Randy: Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?
Jimbo: ...What??
Randy: Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.
Burly man: Well... Let's go kick his ass!
Other men: Yeah!
Jimbo: Where is he?!
Randy: Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.
Gerald: Can I come with you?
Pip: Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?
Butters: Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
Pip: Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.
Reporter: Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts.
Stan: Whoa, cool!
Dougie: I wanna be a reporter someday.
Pip: Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.
Dougie: Do you think someday I can be a reporter?
Stan:: Dude!
Butters: Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?
Pip: Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.
Randy: I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
Gerald: So, so now we can't be friends?
Gerald: We said we'd never tell anybody?
Gerald: Well, uh uh a few people, yeah.
Gerald: Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
Butters: Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?
ATF lead: Lay down your weapons!
Stan: We don't have any weapons.
Butters: Whoa!
ATF lead: I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique.
Barbrady: What's the Ganz technique?
Mr. Garrison: That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?
Mr. Mackey: Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.
Mr. Garrison: Well, hell, turn it up.
Goateed man: Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he's gay.
Other man: Oh, is he?
Goateed man: Huh?
Randy: Who who did you hear is, is gay?!
Goateed man: Ricky Martin, the singer.
Gerald: Hey, Randy, what's up?
Gerald: Huh?
Randy: Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
Gerald: Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
Randy: There's nothing to talk about.
Gerald: You're having regrets, aren't you?
Randy: No, I-... I don't know.
Gerald: Hey. Talk to me.
Randy: No!
Gerald: I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
Randy: Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
Sharon: Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!
Randy: Ogh, I already did.
Stan: Mom!
Butters: How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?
Reporter: I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest?
Ganz: We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now.
Dougie: See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
Reporter: So what are your plans, commander?
Ganz: Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out.
Butters: Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-
Stan: Sh!
Reporter: Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander.
Ganz: It is, but we can't let them kill themselves.
Stan: We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
Pip: But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
Butters: Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.
Reporter: For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out.
Stan: Tell them not to burn us down.
Dougie: Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news.
Pip: Now what do we do?
Dougie: Hey, I'm a real reporter.
Ganz: We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.
Reporter: Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves.
Reporter: Yes.
Gerald: Having a good time?
Randy: Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?
Gerald: I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-
Guest: Good night, everyone.
Butters: Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?
Butters: Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.
Stan: Can you hit a target, Pip?
Stan: Nice job, Pip.
Pip: Did I do a nice job? Really?
Butters: Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?
Reporter: Huh?
Gerald: Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
Randy: What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
Gerald: I just want to know it meant something to you.
Mackey: Uh. Well, it's not like you're the only guy who's ever watched another guy masturbate; I've done it.
Man 1: Yeah, uh I've done it a few times.
Man 2: Yep.
Man 3: Yup.
Man 4: Uh huh.
Man 5: Me too.
Man 6: Myeup, me too.
Man 7: Yup.
Randy: You mean it? I'm not gay?
Randy: Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!
Gerald: So we're friends again?
Randy: Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!
Ganz: Alright everyone, fire!
Blond agent: Simulation?
Ganz: Woops.
ATF agent: Sir, this isn't gonna look good.
Derek: Say, that was a fine piece of journalism, boys.
Dougie: Wow, you mean that?
Butters: Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!
Pip: There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.
Butters: Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.
Stan: But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
Butters: Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
Kyle: Hoh, dude, weak.
Stan: Super weak.
Sheila: Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?
Gerald: I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!
Sheila: Kyle!
Sheila: Go get the door, Kyle!
Kyle: Oh! Hey, Kenny.
Kenny: (Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)
Kyle: I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
Kenny: (What's that?)
Kyle: It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
Kenny: (Oh, that's alright.)
Kyle: Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
Kyle: Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
Kyle: ...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
Kenny: (Aw.)
Gerald: You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout.
Kyle: Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Sheila: Kyle, eh, the problem is...
Kyle: Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
Gerald: Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Kenny: (Squirts?)
Sheila: You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.
Kenny: (Oh.)
Sheila: And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid."
Kenny: (Uh huh.)
Sheila: Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it.
Kenny: (Uh huh!)
Kyle: No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
Sheila: Ike, you behave!
Kyle: No, Ike!
Kyle: I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
Gerald: Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.
Kyle: What? You want me to lie?
Gerald: Yeah, lie.
Kyle: Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--
Kyle: Wow, cool.
Ranger: Welcome to Jewbilee. You folks find it okay?
Kyle: He was huge.
Ranger: Yeah. We spotted him a few days ago. Nothing to worry about, though. Your boys are safe with us.
Sheila: I'm sure they are.
Gerald: We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.
Sheila: Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?
Kenny: (Uh huh?)
Squirt leader: I'm the Squirt leader. I don't want to be the Squirt leader, but I don't have a choice; it's the only way I can earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend all night instructing Squirts.
Kyle: You have to go with him, Ike.
Ike: Buh buh buh buh.
Ike: Boul ball.
Ranger: Name?
Kyle: Kyle Broflovski.
Kenny: (Kenny McCormick.)
Ranger: What?
Kyle: Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.
Kyle: This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
Elder 3: Elder Garth, from the synagogue of anti-Semites.
Elder Garth: We're new.
Squirt 1: How come we have to make macaroni pictures?
Ike: No.
Squirt 2: How come your head is lookin' so... funny-looking?
Elder: Uhhhh, yess, and what is your name, young man?
Inductee: Junichi.
Elder: Raise your left hand and repeat after me: I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
Inductees: I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
Elder: My honor, wide and true.
Inductees: My honor, wide and true.
Elder: I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
Inductees: I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
Elder: Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew.
Inductees: Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew.
Elder: [brings forth a large bell] Nahit chaim.
Inductee 1: Nahit chaim. [the elder lowers the bell over his head and strikes it once to produce a long, loud peal, then raises it. The boy walks off]
Elder: Nahit chaim.
Inductee 2: Nahit chaim. [the elder lowers the bell over his head, strikes it, and raises it. The boy stumbles away crying]
Elder: Nahit chaim.
Squirt leader: Okay, Squirts, let's see what you made macaroni pictures of. Ishmael?
Ishmael: Apple.
Squirt leader: Good. Matthew?
Matthew: Cat.
Squirt leader: Joseph?
Joseph: Triangle.
Squirt leader: Okay. Ike?
Ike: Cokeshen.
Chief elder: All sects of Judaism follow the words of Moses.
Elder Garth: Not mine. Tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the New Time, heh. We should use it to pray to Haman and enter into a new millennium faith, and it--
Chief elder: Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here!
Elder Garth: All you ever do is worship Moses, but it says in the Book of Centuries that Haman will one day lead the Jews.
Elder Harris: We pray to Moses here, elder.
Elder Garth: If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?!
Chief elder: We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here!
Chief elder: Hello.
Kyle: Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
Kenny: (What the fuck are we doing?)
Kyle: This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
Kenny: (Uheheheheh, that's stupid.)
Kyle: It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
Scouts: May the teachings of Moses fill our ears and our hearts respectively.
Chief elder: Great Moses, we, your most loyal followers, want to thank you a lot for coming.
Moses: The hour of Jewbilee is near. Let all debts be forgiven and all slaves freed. Mwaaaaaaaaaah!
All: Aaaaaaaaaah!
Squirt leader: Jesus! Hell, he got another Squirt!
Ike: Mommy.
Chief elder: Great and honorable Moses, what do you desire from us, your children?
Moses: I desire... [the elders and the Scouts await anxiously] I desire... mamaroni pictures.
Chief elder: Yeh yes, yes, the macaroni pictures are coming right away. Uh, anything else you want from us, O great leader of the people?
Moses: I desire... popcorn necklaces.
Moses: Hold! [Kenny stops in his tracks as Kyle looks on. Kenny looks at Moses] There is... an impurity.
Moses: This child here is not kosher.
Kyle: Don't worry. I know what to do.
Kyle: Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
Chief elder: A non-Jew has infiltrated Jew Scouts and looked upon the face of Moses! He must be dealt with!
Kenny: (I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)
Chief elder: You are banished from here. You must leave before the great eating of carrot cake.
Kenny: (What?!)
Kyle: He doesn't get cake?
Moses: No cake for the impurity.
Moses: [spins around and around] Aaggghhh! [the others turn to see what's happening]
Elder Garth: [prostrated, with conch in hand] Infatu camdavid. David hakum ba'ikan shtud!
Chief elder: Elder, what are you doing?!
Elder Garth: [now standing with hands outstretched] Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht!
Elder Harris: He's reading from the Book of Haman!
Moses: [spins and shrinks to fit in the shell] Eo! Eh! Diu! [disappears into the shell]
Elder Garth: And there you shall stay, trapped for all eternity!
Chief elder: Elder, what have you done?
Scout: When do we get to eat carrot cake?
Elder Garth: Now... All of you into that building, or I shoot you where you stand!
Chief Elder: Elder, you cannot mean--
Kyle: Dude, what the hell is going on?!
Chief elder: If he summons Haman, we will all be destroyed.
Kenny: (Oh no!)
Ike: No.
Squirt leader: God-damnit! You stupid god-damned son of a bear, you've taken your last Squirt! Do you hear me?!
Chief elder: If he summons Haman, it will be the end of everything we hold dear.
Scout: I wanna go home.
Elder Garth: Let the New Tide turn! Let Haman rule his people once again!
Chief Elder: It's hopeless.
Elder Harris: Uh I'm fine with obeying.
Kyle: Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
Elder 2: How?
Kyle: Kenny will find a way.
Squirt 2: Yeah, so his mommy brought us all over to play with him.
Bear cub: Mrar.
Squirt: They are? Uh oh.
Kenny: (Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)
Squirt: Come on, Squirts. We have to help them.
Schlomo: What?!
Elder Schwartz: Look out!
Elder Garth: Don't move!
Elder Garth: It's the summoning of Haman, fool! The awakening of a new kingdom, heeheh!
Schlomo: You can't wake Haman. What would Moses say?
Elder Garth: Moses is trapped for all eternity in the conch of blind faith!
Elder Schwartz: It is lost.
Elder Garth: Zayak. Kareem! [Kenny comes up behind him]
Elder Schwartz: It's the Squirts.
Kyle: Go, Ike!
Elder Schwartz: Unlock the door, Squirts! The keys are up there.
Elder Harris: They'll never reach.
Kenny: (Ow!)
Elder Harris: Oh, no. It's too late!
Elder Garth: Ramek shtud! [lightning strikes the ground. Nearby, the bear returns and gets the conch shell. She moves away, only to take it to Kenny, who receives it. The bear growls and leaves. Meteors continue to shower down as a black cloud with a pair of red eyes appears among the gathering clouds]
Kyle: What is that?
Elder Schwartz: It is Haman.
Haman: Free! Free to punish those that imprisoned me!
Kyle: Kenny! Noooooo!
Haman: Moses! Nooo!
Moses: Die! [lightning comes out of both his eyes and nukes Garth until Garth explodes]
Elder Harris: That blow to his head must have killed him.
Elder Carn: He saved us. He saved all the Jews.
Kyle: You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
Elder Harris: We've learned a lot from you and your great friend, Kenny.
Moses: [joins them next to Kenny] Every year we shall gather here in this special place and bring Kenny tidings of soap sculptures and macaroni pictures.
Elder Harris: Yes.
Moses: And those little shaker things where... you put beans inside of paper plates that are glued together.
Elder Harris: Paper-plate bean shakers.
Moses: And let us put patterns of glue on the outside of those paper plates so we can then pour glitter on them so they can look nice and sparkly.
Elder Schwartz: You heard him, Scouts! Let's get to work!
DJ: Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids.
Kyle: Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.
Cartman: Christmastime is presents for me.
Jimbo: Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house.
Cartman: Cool!
Cartman: Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!
Kenny: (You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)
Boy in Green Shirt: BOO!
Boy in Green Shirt: Ha ha ha ha ha! We scared you, chickens!
Stan: W-we weren't scared!
Kyle: The what?
Boy in Green Shirt: Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts.
Kyle: Nuh-uh.
Stan: That's just an old legend.
DJ: Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks?
Priest Maxi: Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh!
DJ: Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh?
Priest Maxi: KoRn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil!
Stan: Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.
Cartman: We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.
Kyle: That's not scary, fatass!
Pirate Ghosts: Darrrr!
Jonathan: Are you sure we're goin' the right way?
David: I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense.
Fieldy: When are we gonna get to the gig? I'm starving.
Jonathan: Don't think about it. We'll just keep playing our game. Ready? I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter T!
Munky: I know! A t-ree!
Jonathan: You've got it. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter R.
David: A road?
Pirates: Darrrr!
Jonathan: Okay, here's one. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter P.
Head: The letter P?
Fieldy: What the heck starts with the letter P?
Liane: E-heric, it's only Halloween.
Liane: I'm sorry, hon,
Liane: Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, he's big-boned.
Cartman: God-damnit, mom!
Stan: Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
Cartman: How?
Stan: What's the scariest thing we could get?
Kyle: Yeah, fatass, a dead body.
Kyle: Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
Cartman: So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
Kyle: Are you insane?!
Cartman: U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Stan: All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
Stan: Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
Cartman: This is gonna be fun!
Stan: Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!
Kyle: Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
Stan: Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
Kyle: I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
Stan: You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!
Kyle: I don't really care, dude.
Cartman: Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "You-hoo"...
A voice: Hi, Kyle.
Kyle: Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!
Cartman: Heh heh, I'm sweet.
Kyle: Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
Stan: Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.
Kyle: How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
Cartman: We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: "Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"
Kyle: Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
Stan: Who was that?
Kyle: Cartman?!
Male voice: Who-o-oa.
The Boys: Wa-a-a-ah!
Munky: Hey! Like, it's just some kids.
Jonathan: Oh, fwooh, I was really scared there, for a second.
Stan: Hay, you're that band KoRn.
KoRn: Nibblet!
Stan: What are you guys doing out here?
Head: We were just driving our van when all of a sudden we were run off the road by some super-spooky pirate ghosts.
Stan: Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
Kyle: Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
Stan: Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
Jonathan: Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is?
Jonathan: Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow.
Jonathan: Groovy! Could you show us where to set up?
Kyle: Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
Kenny: (Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
Brunet: Mrs. Broflovski?
Sheila: Yes?
Brunet: We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you?
Brunet: Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave.
Sheila: Defiled? How?
Blond: Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up.
Sheila: Dug her up? Why??
Brunet: Well. The- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.
Blond: Yeahp.
Sheila: What?!
Brunet: Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak.
Blond: Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable.
Sheila: Hoh, dear God!
Brunet: Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.
Brunet: Yes. And, now for the difficult part.
Blond: Brace yourself.
Brunet: It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-
Sheila: Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!
Brunet: ...Do?
Blond: Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen.
Brunet: Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something.
Delivery Man: Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?
Cartman: [walks up with the doll and jingles] Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
Stan: Where's your costume, fatass?
Stan: Hey, Kenny.
Kenny: (Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)
Cartman: U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!
Stan: What's the problem?
Cartman: Nno Grandma.
Kyle: No Grandma??
Cartman: Nno Grandma.
Crowd: Ee-oooh!
Man: Excuse me, how is this helping?
Barbrady: That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.
Jonathan: Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts.
DJ: Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled.
Jonathan: Cancelled?
Jonathan: Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up.
Munky: Oh, hey! The kids from last night.
David: Hey, Kenny.
Jonathan: Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum.
Kyle: Somebody took my dead grandma.
Fieldy: What?
Stan: We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.
Fieldy: Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry.
Jonathan: Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts.
David: They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates.
Jonathan: Huh?
David: "Pirate ghost" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate.
Fieldy: You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact.
Jonathan: But that makes them pirate ghosts.
David: No. It makes them ghost pirates.
Munky: Pirate ghosts!
Head: Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do.
Jonathan: Pirate ghosts.
Kyle: Then, you'll help us?
Jonathan: Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing we like more than playing music, it's solvin' a groovy mystery.
The Boys: Al-right!
Chef: Is everybody okay?
Gerald: I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.
Mr. Garrison: He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.
Sharon: Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!
Man: Down with KoRn!
Jonathan: So this is where you last saw your dead grandma.
Stan: Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
Jonathan: Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues.
Stan: How should we split up?
Kyle: Wow! That was easy.
Woman: Let's flip it over!
Some Folks: Yeah!
Crowd: Yeah!
Man 2: Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!
Stan: This place gives me the creeps.
Kyle: Whoa. What was that?
Head: What does this dead grandma look like?
Cartman: Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.
Munky: Good idea.
Cartman: How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
David: We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll.
Munky: Come on, kid. We all have to do our part, even Antonio.
Peg-leg: Raaarrrgh!
Fieldy: Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan?
Peg-leg: Raaarrrgh!
Cartman: Wow, cool!
Secure Group: Aaaaah!
Stan: We've got to hide!
Head: Oh, no!
Stan: Ow!
Pirate Ghosts: Aarrrrgh.
Randy: KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
Munky: Munky!
David: David!
Fieldy: Fieldy!
Head: Head!
Jonathan: Jonathan!
Cartman: That didn't help at all.
Head: We know. It's just cool to do.
Pirate Ghosts: Aarrrrgh!
David: You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them!
Chef: What the...?
Man: Father Maxi?
Barbrady: Oh?
Jonathan: No! Arrest him!
Mob: Huh??
Chef: Well, I must say I still don't get this at all.
Jonathan: It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks.
Chef: Father, why did you go to all this trouble?
Priest Maxi: Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!
Chef: Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?
Brunet: Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody?
Priest Maxi: No.
Sheila: Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!
Stan: There she is!
Mob: Oooh!
Man: Ho-hoh.
Chef: Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!
Sharon: Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?
Jonathan: Well, sure. Why the heck not?
Pirate Voice: Raarrrr!
All: Nibblet!
Nibblet: Uh oh!
Jonathan: Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive.
Stan: Boo!
Kitty: Reowr.
Cartman: No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!
Kitty: Reowr.
Kitty: Roar?
Cartman: Yes.
Cartman: Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!
Announcer: All the Chinpokomon are in stores now.
Cartman: Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!
Liane: What is it, Eric?
Liane: Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?
Cartman: Sweet.
Butters: Wuh-I love Chinpokomon.
Boy: Give it here!
Stan: Hey, fat ass.
Cartman: Hey, dick-whore. I guess you saw the commercial, too.
Stan: Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe.
Cartman: C'mon.
Kenny: (Nuh uh!)
Cartman: C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--
Kenny: (No!)
Cartman: C'mon.
Kenny: (No!)
Cartman: C'mon. Give me Pengin!
Kenny: (No! This is mine!)
Cartman: C'mon!
Sharon: Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things.
Liane: They're so strange. Where are they from?
Cashier: Well, it's some new big thing from Japan. I tell you, those Japanese really know how to market to kids.
"Ash": I have to become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.
Cartman: Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.
Kenny: (Fuck you!)
Cartman: God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!
Stan: What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
Kyle: Huh?
Kyle: No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
Cartman: Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.
Stan: Yeah, like ancient history.
Kyle: Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
Stan: No, dude!
Cartman: Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.
Kyle: Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
Cartman: It's all Chinpokomon now.
Stan: Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
Kyle: What's the Primary Main Objective?
Cartman: You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
Stan: The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
Kyle: Well, what's the Evil Power?
Kyle: What?
Cartman: Duhhh!
Cartman: Duhhh!
Gerald: Yeah, I guess so.
Sheila: What's a Chinpokomon?
Kyle: I'm not sure.
Sheila: Well, why do you need one?
Kyle: I don't know.
Sheila: ...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.
Kyle: Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
Gerald: Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.
Ike: Neah Kyle doh.
Gerald: You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand?
Kyle: Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
Kyle: Thanks.
Ike: Hey, Chih-paw-ko.
Lambtron: I love you. Let's be best friends, and destroy the capitalistic American government.
Cashier: What the hell is goin' on here?
Cartman: Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.
Kyle: What?
Stan: Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?
Announcer: Chinpokomon, what is Primary Objective?
Stan/Kenny/ Cartman: To destroy the Evil Power!
"Ash": I've got to buy all the Chinpokomon so I can destroy the Evil Power, oooh?
Stan/Kenny/ Cartman: Oooh?
"Ash": I've got to buy them all, so first I'd better go to Hawaii and visit Pearl Harbor.
"Ash": I must buy them all! I must buy them all!
Stan: Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!
Cartman: Cool! This game rules!
Cashier: Rr-Red Harris? I own a toy store in America?
Japanese woman: Purease state the puhpose-uh.
Taller man: I am President Hirohito. And-ah, this is Mr. Ose.
President Hirohito: We unduhstand you have big concern about our fine pro-duct.
Red: Well?
Mr. Ose: Uuuh.
Red: Well, now, come on, I don't think that that quite satisfies my--
President Hirohito: You are American?
Red: Yes.
Red: Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!
President Hirohito: Nothing. We are very simple people. With very small penis. Mr. Ose penis is ...especially small.
Mr. Ose: Uh, hoh, what an-whoa immense penis-uh!
Red: Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk, I just wanted to bring that little malfunction to your attention. Bye-bye now.
Cartman: I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
Randy: Why?
"Ash": Hey! Is that a good idea?
"Eight": Roostors aren't like Chuchunezumis. They haven't the heart for such endeavors.
Randy: ...Are those good moral values?
Sharon: I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
Narrator: But Lambtron's powers also give him a good chance for a new fight. Will he succeed?
"Ash": I am sad now, because Lambtron must be very lonely because there are so few Lambtrons in the world. Will he ever find a companion?
Sharon: This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
Randy: I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.
Sharon: Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!
Randy: Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.
Cartman: I haven't made any money yet.
Stan: What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
Cartman: Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
Cartman: Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!
Stan: Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
Kyle: Camp?
Stan: You didn't know that?
Stan: Dude, did you just say "a-ight"?
Cartman: Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!
Stan: Yeah, dude. Nobody says "a-ight" anymore.
Kyle: What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
Cartman: Like, eight days ago.
Sharon: We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel.
Liane: Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.
Sheila: Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.
Sheila: Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.
Sharon: You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.
Sheila: Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?
Cartman: Get outta the way! Move it!
Stan: It's starting, it's starting!
Kids: Chinpokomon is what we strive to be great at in our hearts!
Mr. Ose: What is the Primary Main Objective?
Kids: To destroy the Evil Power!
Kyle: ...Power.
Cartman: Ohhh.
Mr. Ose: United Statesuh government is the Evil Power! It hasa taken Japanese Americans! It hasa broken Japanese spirit! And what do Chinpoko Masters do to Evil Power?!
Kids: Destroy it!
Kyle: Destroy it?
Cartman: Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
Mr. Garrison: No, goddammit, it's eighteen!!
Mr. Garrison: For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand!
Mr. Garrison: What did he say?!
Stan: He said, "Garrison-san sabuchii da naa."
Mr. Garrison: Damnit, this is not Japan!!
Mayor: People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying...
Mr. Garrison: I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp.
Priest Maxi: I tell you, Mayor, these Japanese are trying to change our American children somehow!
President Hirohito: We at the Japan Toy Company are vetty cohncerned about-a your cohncerns. That is why we make Chinpokomon camp.
Randy: Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!
President Hirohito: There is nothing to worry about. We at Japan Toy Company are in awe of your large penis.
Mr. Garrison: What?
President Hirohito: You Americans have such humungous burbous penis.
Mr. Garrison: Well, uh-I guess that's true.
Mr. Ose: Oh, suh-n nice-a big penis American.
President Hirohito: What can we possubruh do with such small penis? We cannot take over your city, filled witha men awith such mastodonic penis.
Jimbo: Huwell, uh he's got a point there.
Randy: Well, I guess that settles that.
Priest Maxi: We're sorry we took your time, gentlemen.
Mayor: O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution.
Liane: You have?
Sharon: Of course! That's a great idea!
Sheila: But what toy?
Announcer: Hey, kids. Do you like Chinpokomon?
Boys: Yeah!
Cartman: ...Gay.
Stan: Yeah, dude. That was totally gay.
Announcer: Hey, kids. Do you like Chinpokomon?
Boys: Yeah!
Boy 2: Wow!
Boys 1/2: I wanna be just like Alabama Man.
Announcer: Alabama Man comes with everything you see here. Wife sold separately.
Cartman: Gay.
Stan: Totally gay.
Kyle: Liberace gay.
Sharon: Stan?
Mr. Ose: Owatta!
Sharon: Stanley--
Sharon: --you need to come home right now.
Sharon: Mommy misses you.
Sharon: Stanley, I'm talking to you!
Sharon: No, it's not okay!
Sharon: What?
Sharon: Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!
Gerald: Oh God, is there nothing we can do?
Sheila: How?
Reporter: And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States.
Mr. Ose: Your plane will fly autopilot to Pearl Harbor! When you arrive you will drop many bombs!
Stan: What?
Randy: Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!
Stan: You like it?
Mr. Garrison: You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.
Liane: Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.
Cartman: Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.
President Hirohito: Whar are they doing?!
Mr. Ose: It's a trick!
Cartman: Where are you going, Stan?
Randy: Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.
Stan: Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?
Sheila: Kyle, it's over!
Kyle: But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
Kyle: What?
Kyle: Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
Stan: No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.
Kyle: So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
Stan: ...Ye-eah.
Randy: Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.
Cartman: Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!
Stan: Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?
Kyle: Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
Liane: Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.
Jimbo: Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks.
Gerald: You bet money on my son to win?!
Cartman: You're going down, bitch!
Kyle: Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.
Cartman: Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
Jimbo: Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!
Kyle: What's a "home-schooled kid"?
Cartman: What?! What the fuck that that mean?
Mark: "Conscientious." May I have the definition, please?
Mayor: Closely attentive to details. Careful.
Mark: "Conscientious." Could you use it in a sentence, please?
Mayor: Mary's analysis of the spreadsheet was... conscientious.
Mark: "Conscientious." C O N S C I E N T I O U S.
The Cotswolds: Way to go, Mark! Alright!
Mayor: Eric, your word is "chair."
Cartman: Uuh. Definition?
Mayor: Something you sit on.
Cartman: Country of origin?
Cartman: Could you please use it in a sentence?
Mayor: Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is "chair"!!
Mayor: Having to do with a lake or ocean.
Rebecca: "Litoral." Will you please use it in a sentence?
Mayor: Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.
Kyle: What??
Mayor: Krocsyldiphithic.
Kyle: Definition?
Mayor: Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality.
Kyle: Uh, could you use it in a sentence?
Mayor: Certainly. "Krocsyldiphithic" is a hard word to spell.
Kyle: "Krocsyldiphic."
Jimbo: You can do it, kid! You can do it!
Kyle: Wooww.
Mark: It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
Stan: We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
Cartman: How come you don't go to school?
Mark: Because I'm home-schooled.
Stan: What's that?
Mark: My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
Cartman: You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
Mark: Right.
Stan: Shut up, Cartman?
Stan: No, we're friends.
Mark: Strange, friends would call each other names and fight.
Stan: What?
Stan: Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos.
Mark: Papa?
Mr. Cotswolds: Yes, Mark?
Mark: Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
Mark: But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Pap.
Mark: I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like.
Mr. Cotswolds: Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it.
Mark: Please, Pap. Just let me try it for a few days.
Mr. Cotswolds: Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is!
Mark: Hooray!
Mr. Cotswolds: You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca?
Kyle: ...Uuh, can I talk to her?
Rebecca: Hel-lo.
Mrs. Cotswolds: A little boy wanted to see Rebecca.
Mrs. Cotswolds: But the children won, and they were happy to meet the other children.
Mark: Hey, guys. What's up?
Cartman: Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?
Cartman: Ey! How come you never pick me?!
Mr. Garrison: Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?
Mark: The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.
Stan: Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.
Stan: You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, please God, let it be forever.
Stan: Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me."
Pip: But, if I say that, you'll hit me.
Pip: Please, hit me.
Pip: Ooowww!
Stan: Alright, we'll try this again, Pip.
Craig: Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball.
Mark: Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.
Butters: Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
Mark: You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
Craig: Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!
Craig: Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!
Butters: Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
Mark: Oh, dear.
Mr. Cotswolds: Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now.
Mrs. Cotswolds: I'm sure he's alright.
Mr. Cotswolds: Oh my God, son!
Mr. Cotswolds: Mark, what have they done to you?!
Mark: Well, they duct-taped me to a bench.
Mrs. Cotswolds: But why?
Mark: I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all.
Mr. Cotswolds: Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools!
Mark: But I want to go back tomorrow, pap.
Mrs. Cotswolds: What??
Mrs. Cotswolds: What do we do?
Randy: Uh, look, Mr....
Mr. Cotswolds: Cotswolds.
Randy: Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.
Gerald: Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff.
Mr. Cotswolds: Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?
Mr. Cotswolds: I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!
Jimbo: Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?
Mr. Cotswolds: No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers.
Jimbo: You what??
Kyle: ...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
Kyle: Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
Kenny: (Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)
Mark: Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
Stan: Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.
Mark: I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.
Kyle: What??
Mark: Huh?
Kyle: Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
Stan: Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
Cartman: Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door.
Cartman: Mom?
Liane: Yes?
Cartman: Could you turn up the heat just a little?
Rebecca: Oh, hel-lo.
Kyle: Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
Rebecca: He-ey, would you like to come up to my room?
Kyle: Huh?
Rebecca: Woowould you like to come up to my room?
Mr. Cotswolds: I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school.
Mark: Oh, pap. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?
Mr. Cotswolds: Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise.
Mr. Cotswolds: Mark, where's your sister?
Mark: She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
Mr. Cotswolds: Oh, alright.
Mrs. Cotswolds: Rebecca! Aaah! Aaaaah! Noo-hooo!
Rebecca: I have to extricate a rr-region in his cerebral cortex, or risk ih-nfection to the synaptic responses.
Kyle: Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
Kyle: You will?
Kyle: No no. I mean, go with me.
Liane: Eric, please. We have to do some studying today.
Stan: Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?
Stan: But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
Stan: Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!
Cartman: You're damn straight, he did.
Kyle: You got my note?
Kyle: Uh, can we sit down?
Rebecca: How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?
Rebecca: Well, what else would one do?
Kyle: Love, for one thing.
Rebecca: And woowhat is love?
Kyle: Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
Rebecca: Woowhat means "ki-iss"?
Kyle: When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
Rebecca: Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me.
Kyle: I'm not completely sure.
Rebecca: Y-you bet your sweet a-ass I will.
Craig: Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole.
Stan: Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
Craig: That's the point, buttpipe.
Stan: Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!
Butters: Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.
Randy: Uh, why do we want to all chaperone the dance?
Jimbo: Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!
Jimbo: Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
Kyle: Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
Butters: Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess.
Kyle: Rebecca. You...
Kyle: Uh. All I did was show her how to-
Kyle: Ooww!
Craig: Oh my God!
Stan: Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
Butters: Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.
Jimbo: Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!
Mr. Cotswolds: Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!
Butters: Well, she sure is.
Cartman: Now you're gettin' it.
Jimbo: Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!
Men: Hooray!
Marklar: Marklar, this is Marklar. Approaching Marklar.
Marklar dispatcher: Proceed with marklar and make first contact.
Marvin: Doundobi godia dyum * *
Hollis: No, Marvin, in God's language. English.
Chief: Nn * * de co?
Ethiopian Woman: Wobe dabiga gm * *.
Agent 1: Yes. I'm Connelly, and this is Sphinx. We're with the CIA.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!
Cartman: Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
Connelly: Boys, we need to talk to you about a matter of national security. Now!
Cartman: Oh, dude, this is not cool!
Kyle: Relax, fatass.
Cartman: No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.
Stan: What??
Cartman: Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!
Sphinx: Relax, boys. We just need to talk with you.
Stan: * I told you, fatass.
Connelly: Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space.
Cartman: Whoa, cool.
Sphinx: Cool? That craft appears to have enough plutonium fuel on board to blow up a large city! Do you think that's cool?!
Cartman: Totally!
Cartman: Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.
Stan: Sshh!
Connelly: Who?
Kyle: You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
Cartman: Oh. We don't know him.
Connelly: This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures.
Sphinx: But they're just kids. We can't torture them.
Connelly: Look, we don't know what that craft is capable of, but the kid is going to have to land it somewhere. God only knows what sadistic backwards Third-World country could get their hands on that ship!
Man 3: Boy, that's one creeepy alien.
Marvin: Gmm * Mmm-mm * *.
Mayor: Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip
Man 5: Wait, it's not a gun. It's a piece of paper.
Marvin: * * Muogleblabla mb'g * *.
Mayor: Guess the little pecker doesn't like missionaries.
Sphinx: Now, I'll ask you again. Who is the little boy that took our ship?
The Boys: Aaaaaaaa!
Kyle: Cartman!
Sphinx: Adopted from whom?
Cartman: Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.
Connelly: Sally Struthers!
Sphinx: Where can we find her?!
Connelly: I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go.
Kyle: Good job, fatass!
Cartman: Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.
Connelly: I'm warning you, Bill. Sally Struthers is a bit heavy. But don't say anything, because she's pretty sensitive.
Connelly: Ah, Ms. Struthers.
Connelly: Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia.
Sally: Do ba kim.
Sphinx: Uh, heh-his name is Starving Marvin.
Sally: Mmmmo na ka!
Stan: Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.
Pat: Uh, God wants you to send us money. He needs you to send us money so we can help others.
Kyle: Starvin' Marvin!
Marvin: Bongi groinit * *.
Cartman: Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!
Marvin: Ingan *.
Stan: Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.
Marvin: Chede gwodum * * godom.
Kyle: I think he wants us to get in.
Kyle: Yes!
Stan: This is great!
Stan: Yeah, that's better.
Hollis: Hello? Howare we doing today? Look what I got for you.
Connelly: Here they are!
Hollis: Who are you?
Connelly: We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents!
Kyle: No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
Cartman: No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.
Stan: We're on like, some foreign planet.
Kyle: This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
Marvin: Badak bladla buk.
Marklar Leader: Greetings. Welcome to Marklar.
Stan: Uh, thanks.
Marklar Leader: I am Marklar, leader of the Marklar.
Stan: U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
Stan: Cool!
Cartman: Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
Sta: Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!
Marklar Leader: We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us.
Marklar Leader: Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar.
Kyle: Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
Marklar Leader: Well, there is a lot of room on Marklar. If Marklar here wants to bring his marklar to Marklar, that would be fine. Just take our marklar back to Marklar and bring all the marklar back with you.
Stan: Uuh. Thanks.
Marvin: * *.
Marvin: Muwuhbuh * * mlamleblubluh mjek.
Connelly: Back away from the space craft, children!
Stan: Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.
Hollis: Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ?
Cartman: No, never. It's perfect.
Stan: What??
Kyle: Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
Connelly: You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government!
Kyle: Oh, no, dude!
Susan: Amazing.
Pat: Yeah. We're not sure what these hyper-intelligent beings look like, but one thing is for sure: they've never heard of Jesus Christ.
Susan: What can we do at the 600 Club to help those poor aliens?
Connelly: I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.
Connelly: Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw.
"Brokaw": What?! Do you question my integritah?!
"Brokaw": Buh-eh, ugh. I had some bad burritos today.
Marvin: * * wughum chughum * *, * *.
Connelly: Son of a bitch!
Stan: Run for it!
Cartman: Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!
Kyle: Watch out! Here I come!
Kyle: Kenny!
Stan: He's not done for, he's standing right there.
Kenny: (You guys, just fly away!)
Connelly: Damnit, damnit, damnit!
Stan: Alright, we made it!
Kyle: Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
Boys: Aaaa!
Stan: They're shooting at us.
Kyle: Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.
Kyle: Well, how'd we do it last time??
Stan: Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.
Kyle: Which button did you press, Cartman??
Cartman: U-u-huh. I don't remember.
Kyle: You don't remember?!
Stan: You dumbass, Cartman!
The Boys: Aawwww!
Hollis: The ship seems to be made out of a... super-strong alloy. These lasers aren't powerful enough.
Connelly: Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel.
Sphinx: We need to use your ship to catch those boys. We will do anything for that technology.
Sphinx: Ms. Struthers, if those Ethiopians make it to another planet, who will send money to your foundation? Without Ethiopians, you have no food.
Sally: Wo? Wo chaka gom??
Kenny: (Oh my God, I get it.)
Cartman: Holy shit!
Crew: Aaah.
Hollis: Holy crap, they have photon torpedoes.
600 Crew: Aaah.
Stan: You got 'em, Marvin.
Sally: Ho ho ho ho.
Cartman: It's Sally Struthers!
Hollis: Well, it appears they'll be going back to Ethiopia, so we can go on to the aliens.
Kyle: Sorry, Marvin. We tried.
Cartman: Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
Sally: Wo?
Cartman: She bought it.
Stan: Sally Struthers is saving us!
Stan: Now's our chance!
Hollis: They've opened the wormhole!
Boys: Aaaah!
Marklar: Please, please, please. We are confused. You must explain one at a Marklar.
Hollis: Alien friend, we are here to spread the Word of Jesus. He died for your sins.
Marklar: Who? Marklar?
Stan: We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.
Marklar: Brought m- marklar??
Hollis: What is "marklar"?
Marklar: Yyou're marklar; everyone and everything is referred to as marklar.
Sphinx: Doesn't that get confusing?
Marklar: Oh no. Watch this. Hey, Marklar!
Marklar: You see?
Marklar: Young marklar, your marklars are wise and true.
Hollis: What the hell did he say?
Kyle: Thanks.
Marklar: The marklars can stay!
Ethiopians: Wooo!
Boys: Alright!
Cartman: Alright,
Marklar: You marklars must leave.
Marklar: Yes, that's nice. Thank you for stopping by.
Stan: Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.
Marvin: Chak chak glika gm gm guchab mglup.
Kyle: No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
Sally: Bwo chaaga bi.
Marvin: Chak chak m geteaub m * *.
Stan: Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.
Cartman: Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.
Stan: Dude!
Cartman: What? We're not gonna come visit him.
Stan: I know, but you don't tell him that!
Kyle: Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Cartman: I'm playing the drum.
Kyle: You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
Cartman: I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
Stan: That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!
Cartman: Ey, I'll get it!
Kyle: Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
Cartman: Yes I will!
Cartman: Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, dammit!
Cartman: What?
Kyle: Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
Cartman: No way! Flutes are totally gay!
Stan: Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
Kyle: You dick!
Cartman: Later.
Kyle: He'll show.
Stan: He'd better!
Jimbo: I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.
Men: Whoa. Mmm.
Stan: Dude, that's not cool.
Stan: Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Kyle: Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
Cartman: Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
Stan: You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!
Cartman: Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
Grandpa: Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead.
Kyle: The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
Cartman: Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.
Kyle: No they're not, stupid!
Cartman: Yes we are!
Kyle: How much do you wanna bet?!
Kyle: Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
Cartman: Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
Kyle: And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
Cartman: Right.
Kyle: You're on!
Stan: Hoohoo what a dumbass!
Kyle: Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
Stan: It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
Jimbo: ...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!
Confederate Reenactors: Yeah!
Randy: Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.
Man 2: Hey! What's that guy doing?!
Cartman: Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
Grandpa: What the hell?
Randy: He took the bell!
Gerald: He can't do that!
Grandpa: The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!
Stan: Cartman, you can't do that!
Grandpa: God dammit! Now we have to start over!
Cartman: But why? Why should they get the bell?
Jimbo: Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose.
Jimbo: What??
Mr. Garrison: Jimbo!
Jimbo: Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!
Mr. Garrison: Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
Stuart: I'm tired of losing this battle!
Jimbo: And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
Reenactors: Yeah!
Confederate 1: Yaaaaah!
Confederate 2: Come on! Just give up! We're not gonna let you live another day!
Gerald: Uh, what are they doing?
Grandpa: God dammit, what the hell are they doing?!
Kyle: What do we do?!
Cartman: God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
Reenactor: Come on!
Randy: Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!
Jimbo: The South wins!
Reenactors: Yeah, woohoo!
Grandpa: God dammit!
Randy: Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.
Kyle: You cheated, Cartman!
Mr. Garrison: That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too!
Bartender: Yeah.
Reenactor: Yeah.
Gerald: You're dreaming!
Jimbo: Huh?
Cartman: They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
Jimbo: They don't?!
Cartman: No. I say we take Topeka.
Randy: Huh?
Stuart: That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
Mr. Garrison: I'll bet we could!
Jimbo: Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
Reenactor 1: Yeah.
Reenactor 2: Yeah.
Reenactor 3: Yeah.
Reenactor 4: Yeah.
Randy: Well, the Union be damned!
Jimbo: Let's go!
Kyle: They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
Cartman: Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
Mailman: Oh good morning, Mrs. Hollis.
Mrs. Hollis: Hello, Ralph.
Ralph: Did you happen to catch that ball game last night?
South Park Men: Yeah! Yeah!
Jimbo: Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee!
Jimbo: It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!
Reenactors: Yeah!
Ralph: Uh-uh-uh schnapps? Uhm, uh-uh-I guess that would be at the liquor store.
Randy: WHERE?!
Stan: Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
Cartman: Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
Kyle: Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
Stan: That would suck so much ass.
Kyle: We have to stop him, dude.
Stan: I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
Butters: Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
Kyle: We'll give you 10 bucks.
Butters: Oh. O-oh, okay.
Stan: Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
Grandpa: Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed.
Brunet: They say you can either fight them or join them.
Blond: Well I'm joining them. Those blanks hurt!
Kyle: You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
Gerald: This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!
Jimbo: Hey! There's some more schnapps over here!
Grandpa: They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado.
Larsen: Well, we can't just shoot 'em; there's innocents and children about. Dawkins!
Dawkins: Sir!
Larsen: Fire a warning flare!
Larsen: Woops.
Stan: Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
Grandpa: You bastards!
Kyle: Hey!
Larsen: Then how do we stop them?
Stan: I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
Stan: There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.
Grandpa: Nice thinkin', Billy.
Jimbo: Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated.
Cartman: Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
Jimbo: Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?
Jimbo: I guess we drank it all.
Dawkins: Now what?
Stan: Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
Kyle: Yeah.
Soldier 1: Uugh.
Soldier 2: Ouch.
Gerald: Where am I?
Ned: Mmm-oh. Gmm-oh, my head.
Stuart: Me, too.
Randy: Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.
Cartman: God, I hate you guys!
Stan: Where are you going?
Randy: Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
Jimbo: Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here.
Randy: Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.
Gerald: Me neither.
Cartman: Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.
Gerald: What's "grab ass?"
Mr. Garrison: You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
Mr. Garrison: Hohoho.
Jimbo: You heard the General.
Kyle: We'll never stop them now.
Soldiers: Woohoo!
Cartman: Yes! Yes!
Guide: Throughout 1861 the Confederate authorities tried to drive out the Union occupants of Fort Sumter peacefully. But Abraham Lincoln's administration would not surrender the fort to the Confederates, so Jefferson Davis decided to take action.
Tourist: And the Confederates won the fort?
Cartman: Take the fort!
Jimbo: Charge!
Cartman: Suck my ass!
Jimbo: What do we do, General? We're outnumbered.
Cartman: We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
Larsen: Alright, that does it. Blow the whole thing up.
Stan: No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.
Larsen: Sorry, son. We tried it your way; now we do it our way. Prepare the mortar.
Cartman: I knew they would!
Stan: Aw, dammit!
Men: Yee-haw! All right!
Cartman: Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
Al Gore: Oh boy, this doesn't look good.
Advisor: It's just like the Million Man March, except that there actually are a million people.
Cartman: Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
Clinton: Oh, dear God! Wuh-we have to meet their demands.
Advisor: What?? Sir, there's- there's not that many of them.
Al Gore: As Vice-Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them?
Clinton: My hands are tied. Tell General Lee that I'll meet him in front of the Capitol.
Stan: Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
Grandpa: Dammit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it!
Stan: Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?
Clinton: All right, I'm gonna sign the document declarin' the Confederacy winners of the Civil War.
Jimbo: Hey! Who's that?!
Kyle: Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
Stan: Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.
Clinton: Boy, this just keeps getting weirder, doesn't it?
Cartman: What the hell are you guys doing?!
Jimbo: Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!
Stan: Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.
Cartman: What?!
Kyle: Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
Confederates: Wow!
Randy: A whole year?
Jimbo: All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted.
Gerald: Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back.
Cartman: No! We still have to fight!
Cartman: NOOO!!
Kyle: Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
Cartman: Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit!
Stan: Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
Cartman: Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
Kyle: What??
Cartman: The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
Clinton: Eh, he's right, boys. Slavery is illegal and immoral, partially in thanks to the North winning the Civil War.
Stan: Awwww!
Cartman: Hahahaha haa ha!
Kyle: Yeah. Thanks, dick!
Anchor: Fighting the frizzies, at 11.
Kids: Mmm-mmm.
Mr. Hankey: Howdy-ho, folks. We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world.
Cartman: Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
Kyle: Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
Cartman: that's why they're lame.
Stan: Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.
Kyle: I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
Kyle: What, fatass?!
Kenny: (...What?)
Stan: No you didn't!
Cartman: Yes! I really did.
Stan: How do you know?
Kyle: You got your what?
Miss Aliton: Well boys, ah-I don't think I can tell you. Ah-
Stan: Please, it's important.
Kenny: (Me too.)
Netzel: ...Well, it's... the millennium, Jesus.
Jesus: Uuh-huh?
Netzel: Well, it's "The Millennium".
Man 1: Yeah.
Man 2: Yeah.
Man 3: Yeah.
Cameraman: Right.
Jesus: So, what happens at the millennium?
Jimbo: We thought you did.
"Y2K" Man: Yeah, you're supposed to know!
Man 4: Yeah!
Man 5: Yeah, you're Jesus.
Man 6: Hey!
Man 5: You're the one in control.
Jesus: Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace.
Mr. Garrison: Yeah yeah yeah, we've heard that crap for about 2000 years now! We wanna hear somethin' new! It's the year 2000, for Christ's sake!
Crowd: Yeah!
Jesus: Well, what do ya want?
Fr. Maxi: We want to see God!
Randy: Yeah, with our own eyes.
Crowd: Yeah!
Crowd: Yeah!
Woman: That's right!
Man 7: I don't know.
Man 8: I don't know. Is that good or not?!
Stan: Hello?
Kyle: Dude, did you get your period yet?
Kyle: Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
Stan: Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
Kyle: Yeah.
Stan: Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
Kenny: (Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)
Jesus: Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback!
God: Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival.
Jesus: It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you.
God: Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me.
Jesus: But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback.
God: Be ye careful of pride, Jesus.
Jesus: Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30.
God: I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself.
Ike: Uh ar, stufid.
Kyle: Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
Ike: Whoa won toooo-reeee.
Kyle: Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
Ike: No. Martur sucker. Moghee. Muckeh m'gwoss. Tabyudog.
Ike: Cokeh mocker.
Stan: So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
Cartman: Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
Kenny: (No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
Cartman: Tampon? What's a tampon?
Kenny: (See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)
Cartman: Ew, doesn't that hurt?
Kenny: (A little.)
Cartman: Wow, cool!
Cartman: All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
Kyle: Awesome! We get powers?
Jesus: Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!
Stan: Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!
Sharon: Stanley, honey, what's the matter?
Sharon: Well, that's good, honey.
Jimbo: Here he comes!
Mr. Garrison: He's coming out!
Cartman: Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
Cartman: And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
Kyle: I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
Kenny: (Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)
Cartman: Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
Kyle: Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
Cartman: What's the matter, Kyle?
Cartman: ...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
Kenny: (And mine too.)
Chef: How's it going?
Stan: Bad.
Chef: Why bad?
Stan: Can I come in?
Stan: Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.
Chef: OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly.
Stan: No.
Chef: Your little girlfriend, Wendy.
Stan: Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.
Chef: Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?
Stan: Yeah, Cartman told us.
Stan: Okay.
Chef: ...Is that what I said?
Chef: Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.
Agent: I can't tell you how excited Rod Stewart is about this millennium concert. He's gotten a little older, but you're gonna see how much he can still rock.
Jesus: Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God.
Rod: Hullo-o-o.
Rod: Oh.
Jesus: Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!
Rod: Pooped pants.
Jesus: What?
Rod: Pooped pants.
Jesus: Poo pants?
Rod: Pooped 'nmuh pants.
Jesus: Uh, you pooped your pants?
Rod: Pooped in my pants.
Jesus: Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?
Stan: But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
Dr. Mephesto: Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty?
Stan: Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad.
Dr. Mephesto: Your father never went through puberty?
Stan: No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.
Dr. Mephesto: Oh, I can't say that I blame him.
Stan: So do you know anything that can help him?
Dr. Mephesto: Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones.
Dr. Mephesto: My pleasure. I just love helping people.
Cartman: Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
Kyle: Hormones?
Stan: Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
Kyle: Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
Cartman: Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
Stan: So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
Cartman: Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
Cartman: Now, the word is "spirituality." I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
Cartman: Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
Kenny: (Oh- ooowww!)
Cartman: Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!
Kyle: Whoa, dude!
Dr. Doctor: Mr. and Ms. McCormick.
McCormick Parents: Yes?
Dr. Doctor: I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son.
Dr. Doctor: We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do.
Stuart: What happened? What killed him, doctor?
Dr. Doctor: Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank.
Dr. Doctor: My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.
Dr. Doctor: We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to catch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show.
Stuart: Rod Stewart's gonna be in Vegas?
Netzel: How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night?
Stan: Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.
Cartman: Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
Kyle: Did you get your period yet, Stan?
Stan: No. I didn't, but-
Mr. Garrison: This sucks balls!
Blonde: Yeah!
Man 7: Alright, enough of this! Bring out God!
Man 9: Yeah!
Jesus: Oh no.
Crowd: We want God! We want God! We want God!
Crowd: We want God!
Randy: We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
Woman: This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!
Jesus: Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again.
Stan: He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
Jesus: Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.
Stan: Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?
Jesus: Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life.
Stan: What do you mean?
Stan: I just wanted my period.
Man: Whoa, what is that??
Fr. Maxi: God? God is going to show himself??
Jesus: Father. You came.
Randy: That's God?
Mr. Garrison: Well, yeah, but that??
God: What did you expect me to look like, My son?
God: Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question.
Mr. Mackey: Only one?
Sharon: What should we ask him?
Chef: We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, "What's the meaning of life?" or "Why are we here?".
Mr. Garrison: Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??
Skeeter: Let's get him.
Mr. Garrison: Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma.
Cartman: That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas.
Stan: What's Arkansasis that a state?
Mr. Garrison: Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?
Mr. Garrison: Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me.
Mr. Mackey: What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
Mr. Mackey: Well, don't you want to see them?
Mr. Garrison: I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
Mr. Garrison: ...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me.
Mr. Mackey: When was that?
Mr. Garrison: Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't
Cartman: That was pretty cool.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay.
Kenny: (Uh-uh.)
Kenny: (Nope.)
Kyle: Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Cartman: We're trying to find the brown noiseit's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
Stan: What's "lose bowel control?"
Cartman: That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
Kyle: Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
Cartman: Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
Kyle: Nuh-uh!
Kenny: (Nuh-uh.)
Kyle: There is no brown noise, fat boy!
Cartman: That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
Stan: Who's Karen Carpenter?
Mr. Mackey: Mr. Garrison, are you alright?
Mr. Hat: Mr. Garrison isn't here right now.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?
Mr. Hat: Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!
Mr. Mackey: M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?!
Mr. Hat: Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?!
Mr. Mackey: What did you say?!
Mr. Hat: You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you!
Ms. Crabtree: BE QUIET BACK THERE!
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move!
Mr. Mackey: Excuse me?
Coordinator: What school are you from?
Mr. Mackey: Oh, uh we're from South Park, Colorado?
Stan: We're not rednecks!
Kyle: Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!
Kyle: Kenny?
Kenny: (I don't know!)
Tough Guy 1: Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!
Cartman: Aaaa-
Tough Guy 1: Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!
Kyle: What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
Kyle: Awwgh!
Stan: Damnit Cartman, wha-?!
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Oh, hello, son.
Mr. Garrison: Can I ...come in?
Mr. Garrison: No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Uh, what?
Mr. Garrison: I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Uh, okay, like what?
Mr. Garrison Sr.: What??
Mr. Garrison: I have to know why! Right here and nowwe're gonna talk about this!
Mr. Garrison Sr.: What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you!
Mr. Garrison: I know! I wanna know why not?!
Mr. Garrison Sr.: WHAT??
Mr. Garrison: Was it that I was ugly?!
Mr. Garrison: I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!
Coordinator: You heard her, We'll start the rehearsal in a few minutes.
Stan: Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
Kyle: Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
Stan: What word could we make up?
Kyle: How about... finkleroy?
Stan: No, uhno, not finkleroy.
Cartman: How about geebo, or, or mung?
Stan: Yeah, mung.
Kyle: Mung's good.
Tough Guy 1: Well hel-lo there, queefs. All bundled up nice and warm, are we?
Stan: You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
Kyle: Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
Tough Guy 1: Of course we know what mung means!
Stan: We busted you!
Athlete: It sure is.
New Yorker 1: Yeah.
Tough Guy 1: Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach.
Stan: Ooogh.
Stan: You dumbass, Cartman!
Kyle: Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
Mrs. Garrison Sr.: It's so nice to see you, son. I'm so proud that you're part of the 4 Million Child Recorder Blow.
Mr. Garrison: Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about.
Mrs. Garrison Sr.: About what?
Mrs. Garrison Sr.: That... that can't be.
Mr. Garrison: He never did, Mom, not once.
Mr. Garrison: You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep!
Mrs. Garrison Sr.: I'm not listening!
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Uh, what's goin' on?
Mr. Garrison: Mother won't hear the truth!
Mrs. Garrison Sr.: He says you didn't molest him as a child!
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Ah-I didn't! You knew I didn't!
Coordinator: Okay, children. We need to play closer attention to the sheet music. Remember, if you get lost, just follow along with Mr. Kenny G here.
Cartman: Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Kyle: What the hell is that lady talking about?
Stan: I have no idea.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Thuh, that's me.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, my name is Mr. Mackey. I'm your school counselor, m'kay.
Mr. Mackey: Uh-I wanna talk to you about your sonI'm his n-therapist, m'kay.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger!
Mr. Mackey: Eh, you didn't?
Mr. Mackey: Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different.
Mr. Mackey: Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about "sexual molestation", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: I didn't do it because it's wrong!
Mr. Mackey: I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year-old son?!
Mr. Mackey: There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, "How far will I go to save my son's life?"
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Am I the only sane person left on earth?!
Mr. Garrison: Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad.
Reporter: Words to live by.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Uh huh.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Won't be necessary.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: I'm not going to molest you!
Stan: I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
Kyle: Yeah. They think they're so cool.
Kyle: Calm down, Cartman.
Stan: You found what?
Kyle: That's amazing.
Stan: No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
Cartman: Ooooh.
Kyle: Yeah, dude!
Patron 1: Ey, what's the matter there, Garrison? You look kinda sad.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Well, I'm having some troubles at home.
Patron 1: Well, come on. Tell us about it. We always help each other out, don't we, fellas?
Patron 1: Yeah.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right?
Patron 2: Sure!
Patron 3: Yeah we are!
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question?
Patron 1: Absolutely.
Patron 2: Of course.
Patron 4: Yeah, man.
Patron 5: Come on, Garrison!
Patron 2: ...Oh, this is one of them Scruples questions, ain't it?
Patron 2: Oh, like if someone had a gun to your father's head and said, "Have sex with your mother or else I'll shoot him"?
Patron 1: Yeah.
Patron 2: Oh, that's a tough one.
Patron 3: Hmmm.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: No no wait, uh, you don't understand.
Patrons: No, no, no way. No.
Patron 6: But if it was to save my mother's life, uh-I think I would have to have sex with my father.
Patron 7: Yeup.
Patron 8: Me, too.
Patron 9: Well, I think that goes without saying.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son.
Patron 8: Well, personally, I would have sex with my son to save to save my mother's life. It depends, uh- how big a gun are we talkin' here?
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Uh, he doesn't have a gun.
Blond: The father doesn't have a gun?
Mr. Garrison Sr.: No! Nobody's got a gun!
Patron 3: I think if someone said, "Have sex with your mother or else I'm gonna kill your son," but he didn't have a gun, I wouldn't do it.
Patron 1: Yeah.
Patron 3: Sure.
Patron 1: Yeah, a knife.
Bartender: If a killer put a knife to my throat, and said, "Have sex with your father or else I'm gonna kill your mother while having sex with you," ...I would have sex with myself.
Patron 2: That's right.
Patron 3: Uh huh.
Bartender: That makes sense.
Patron 10: Mm-hm.
Patron 1: Wasn't that right?
Patron 3: Mm, See?
Stan: How do we write he note, Cartman?
Cartman: Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
Chip: What??
Mrs. Garrison Sr.: Are you sure you can't stay one more night, son?
Mr. Garrison: No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have.
Mr. Garrison Sr.: Well, I just hope that NOW we can put the past behind us and, and try to be a normal family again.
Mr. Garrison: We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to.
Mrs. Garrison Sr.: We'll be watching on TV. Make us proud, son.
Mrs. Garrison Sr.: You did the right thing, Poppa.
Stan: Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
Kyle: This is gonna be sweet!
Kyle: Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
Mr. Mackey: Uh, aren't those our boys?
Mr. Garrison: Oh, no. What are they doing?
Kenny G.: Well, I see. Other than making everyone in the world crap their pants, our event went over really well.
Kyle: Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
Kyle: Huh?
Tough Guy 2: Yeah!
Tough Guy 1: Ey! Not so fast! We know it was you guys that changed the music and made everyone on Earth crap their pants!
Stan: Uuuuh...
Tough Guy 2: Yeah, we knows all about it!
Kyle: Oh, no!
Tough Guy 1: Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool.
Kyle: Huh?
Stan: You do?
Tough Guy 1: Sure. I mean, everyone on Earth shit themselves 'cause of you. And that's pretty cool. I mean, that's pretty amazing!
Tough Guy 2: Yeah, we was wrong about you guys. We're sorry.
Cartman: Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
Ms. Crabtree: Which way should we go?
Liane: What is it, snookums?
Liane: Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
Liane: Don't say "tits," Eric.
Cartman: Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
Liane: Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.
Liane: But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.
Stan: What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
Kyle: He's fat and he's stupid?
Stan: Two dollars!
Kyle: No way!
Stan: For one tooth?
Cartman: For one tooth.
Cartman: Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
Stan, Kyle, Kenny: Sega Dreamcast??
Cartman: All we need is teeth.
Stan: I already lost all my baby teeth.
Kyle: You still have baby teeth, Kenny?
Kenny: (No way!)
Stan: Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
Kyle: When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
Timmy: Timmiihh!
Kyle: Right. You're Timmy.
Timmy: Timmiihh! Lemmeouttaheah!
Kyle: Alright! Get ready, Timmy.
Timmy: Timmiihh!
Stan: What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
Stan, Cartman: You what?
Kenny: (You what?)
Timmy: Timmih-
Butters: Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
Stan: Uh, Butters, could we have it?
Butters: Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.
Timmy: Ha-a-ugh.
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Cartman: How are we gonna get it from him?
Stan: I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
Kyle: No, Timmy, wait!
Cartman: Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
Timmy: Hu-aah!
Cartman: Higher, you guys.
Cartman: Ey!
Kyle: Come on, fatass!
Butters: Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!
Stan: Well?
Cartman: Bull's eye!
Liane: Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.
Cartman: I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
Liane: No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.
Cartman: Okay.
Cartman: Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
Liane: Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.
Cartman: I know, huh?
Kyle: Did the tooth fairy come?
Stan: Oh my God!
Kyle: Four dollars?
Kenny: (Oh, my God!)
Cartman: Do you what this means?
Liane: Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman.
Dr. Roberts: Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you?
Liane: Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.
Dr. Roberts: Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost?
Liane: About a hundred and twelve.
Dr. Roberts: ...A hundred and twelve.
Liane: Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
Dr. Roberts: Your son wouldn't happen to be an "alligator," would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it.
Dr. Roberts: What?
Cartman: You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
Liane: I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.
Cartman: Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
Liane: No, honey. It's just-
Cartman: How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
Liane: Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.
Liane: Eric! Eric, wait!
Kyle: No more money??
Stan: What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
Cartman: I know!
Kyle: Cartman, what's going on?!
Stan: Tell us what?!
Kyle: What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"
Cartman: My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
Stan: Dude.
Cartman: Kyle, open your eyes, man!
Kyle: Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
Gerald: No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.
Gerald: Kyle...
Kyle: What about Moses and Abraham?
Gerald: Well, they were probably real.
Gerald: Probably not.
Gerald: Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.
Cartman: Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
Kyle: What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
Cartman: No, man, that's just a TV show.
Cartman: What? That your parents lied to you, too?
Stan: Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
Cartman: How?
Stan: Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
Kyle: All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
Stan: So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Stan: The kid will never even know.
Kyle: What if this is all just somebody's dream?
Cartman: Wow, look at the size of these houses!
Stan: ...Hey, you can't do that!
Cartman: Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
Boy 2: What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years!
Kyle: Two years?
Blond: Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?!
All: Shut up!
Boy 1: Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss!
Stan: Who's the Boss?
Boy 1: Loogie.
Stan: Uuh, yeah.
Cartman: We were there first!
Stan: Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
Loogie: Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what?
Stan: Well, uh-what do you mean?
Boy 1: Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!
Stan: What's a "tooth trade?"
The South Park boys: Wow!
Stan: Amazing.
Cartman: Man, that is tits!
Boy 1: Rowwr!
Loogie: Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me?
Stan: Oh. Uh-I don't know.
Cartman: Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
Kyle: Cartman!
Stan: How much do we get if we work for you?
Loogie: I'll cut you in at 2%.
Stan: We're in!
Dr. Roberts: ...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us!
Dr. Roberts: Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds.
Mr. Foley: It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before.
Dr. Roberts: Where?!
Dr. Roberts: And where, pray, is this "Montreal"?!
Chef: Hello there, children.
The Boys: Hey, Chef.
Stan: We all want double-desserts today!
Chef: Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.
Cartman: That's right. Keep the change, my man.
The Boys: That there's a time and a place for everything, and it's called "college."
Little Chef: Ooo, come on, now.
Girl: What?
Kid 1: Come on, kid. Don't you wanna get high?
Stan: U-uh, Chef.
Stan: Chef!
Stan: CHEF!
Chef: Uh?
Stan: We're not dealing drugs!
Chef: You're not?
Stan: No!
Kyle: See ya.
Stan: Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
Cartman: Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
Stan: We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
Cartman: Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
Cartman: Sure, Kyle.
Mr. Foley: Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association.
Loogie: Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some spaghetti?
Loogie: I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles.
Cartman: So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
Cartman: Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
Weasel: Huh?
Boy 2: He's not gonna do it?!
Boy 2: He's not gonna do it, boss!
Boy 2: Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River?
Anchor: ...to which Ms. Clinton replied, "I don't even like Vagina." Finally tonight, a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is live.
Dan Akawa: Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya!
Dan Akawa: Well, that's a lot of money.How the hell are you gonna get all that in the short amount of time you have left?
Billy: Well, I a-I don't know.
Dan Akawa: Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today.
Billy: Yehahah.
Billy: Really?
Mr. Circlovich: Really?
Cameraman: Naw, come on. D'ya really think anyone will fall for somethin' that stupid?
Mrs, Circlovich: Be sure to put your loose tooth under your pillow, Billy.
Dentists: Got it.
Cartman: Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
Kyle: I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
Stan: Dude, just stop thinking about it.
Billy: I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant?
Mr. Circlovich: I think so, Billy. I think so.
Billy: Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again.
Mr. Foley: Give it up, kids. You're surrounded by dentists.
Loogie: It was a trap!
Mr. Foley: What the hell?
Cartman: Kyle?
Kyle: I am nothing, and everything.
Kyle: Hunh. That was pretty weird.
Stan: What?
Loogie: I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!
Cartman: Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
Loogie: Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has fallen.
Stan: Really?
Loogie: Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways.
Stan: So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
Loogie: Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with.
Kyle: Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
Cartman: ...Tits.
Butters: Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?
Token: That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
Cartman: Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!
Lizzy: We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!
Stan: Sleds are for guys.
Cartman: Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
The rest of the boys: Yeah!
Lizzy: I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!
Kyle: Oh yeah?!
The Girls: Yeah!
Cartman: We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!
The Girls: Yeah!
Stan: You got it!
The rest of the boys: Yeah!
A few others: Yeah!
Lizzy: Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!
Stan: Noo problem!
Lizzy: Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
Kyle: Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
Lizzy: See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!
Stan: Oh, boy! We'll show them!
Butters: Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
Clyde: Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are.
Kyle: Fatass.
Mr. Mackey: And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay?
Liane: Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?
Liane: Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!
Mr. Mackey: Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks at people is bad, Eric.
Cartman: No way!
Man 1: Counselor Mackey?
Mr. Mackey: Yes?
Agent Keen: We're here to investigate the rock-throwing incident.
Mr. Mackey: Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention.
Cartman: ...What the hell is a hate crime?
Mr. Mackey: Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-
Agent Keen: New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense.
Cartman: What? A federal offense?
Mr. Mackey: Oh no.
Cartman: Oh no??
Liane: Oh my goodness.
Prosecutor: Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of "Token?"
Cartman: Uh, yes?
Prosecutor: Who is Token?
Cartman: He's a black kid that goes to my school?
Cartman: I did?
Cartman: No! I hate hippies!
Prosecutor: What?!
Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This "monster" committed a crimenot against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!
Stan, Kyle: We know!
Stan: Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
Judge: Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one.
Cartman: No!
Judge: Bailiffs, escort this little bastard to Juvenile Hall.
Kenny: (What the fuck for?!)
Cartman: They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
Kenny: (Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
Kenny: (Hey!)
Cartman: Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
Kenny: (Yes)
Anchor: A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg?
Cartman: Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!
Kyle: What the hell are they doing?
Greg Nimins: The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.
Stan: Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
Lizzy: Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!
Stan: Son of a bitch!
Driver: Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.
Cartman: Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
Stan: Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
Stan: Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
Butters: ...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.
Clyde: Huh?
Kyle: Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.
Clyde: I'm not fat.
Stan: Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
Kyle: Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
Inmates: Yeah!
Romper Stomper: No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in "friends."
Inmates: Yeah!
Cartman: Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.
Romper Stomper: Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here.
Pip: Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
Clyde: So I don't get to be on the team now?
All the boys: Shut up, fatass!
Kenny, Stan: Woopee!
Stan: Yeah-
Kyle: We killed Kenny?
Kyle: Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
Butters: Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!
Pip: This is a sad day for men everywhere.
Stan: You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
All the boys: Yeup.
Kyle: If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
Butters: Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.
Stan: That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
Some boys: Oh?
Kyle: How?
Stan: I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
Kyle: Sweet! Let's go!
The group: Hooray! Alright! Here we go!
Mother 1: And have you been brushing your teeth?
Boy 1: Yes, Mommy.
Mother 1: And not dropping your soap?
Boy 1: Yes, Mommy.
Boy 2: Hi, Mom.
Mother 2: Young man, that is the fourth time you've been late for our visiting time; you are grounded.
Cartman: Hey you guys.
Cartman: Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?
Stan: Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
Cartman: A what?
Cartman: Wwhat's that?
Kyle: Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!
Stan: Yeah, you stupid umbassday!
Cartman: I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here
Stan: ...Yeah.
Kyle: Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
Cartman: Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
Stan: How are we supposed to give them to you?
Cartman: Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
Stan: But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
Cartman: Well, okay... here... l'see...
Stan: Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
Kyle: Me too.
Stan: There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
Cartman: Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
Romper Stomper: You flushed them?!
Cartman: Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.
Romper Stomper: No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.
Cartman: Son of a bitch!
Kyle: Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
Stan: Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
Kyle: Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?
Stan: Hi. Can Token come out and play?
Kyle: Killer.
Token: No.
Token: Yeah.
Steve Black: I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys.
Stan: It's not?
Steve Black: No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor.
Steve Black: No, I'd, actually agree with you.
Kyle: Huh?
Steve Black: Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I'd love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind.
Stan: Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
Steve Black: Oh, he wouldn't listen to me.
Kyle: Why not?
Steve Black: Because I'm black.
Stan, Kyle: Oh.
Cartman: Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!
Cartman: But you said-
Romper Stomper: I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?
Cartman: I thought that-
Romper Stomper: Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here.
Cartman: You will?
Romper Stomper: Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland.
Aide: Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?
Token: Yeah.
Governor: Well, boys, what can I do for you?
Kyle: I don't start, you start.
Stan: That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
Governor: Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.
Cartman: Oh. Really?
Romper Stomper: Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends.
Cartman: Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
Romper Stomper: No! You're supposed to say, "I can't take these," or something, dumbass!
Cartman: Romper?
Romper Stomper: Yeah?
Cartman: You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
Cartman: You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!
Stan: Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
Lizzy: Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!
Bebe: Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!
Kyle: Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
Stan: Alright, where's Clyde.
Stan: Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
Kyle: On the sled, fatass!
Lizzy: Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!
Other girls: Yeah!
Stan: It's Cartman!
Boy Sledders: Hooray!
Cartman: What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
Lizzy: This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!
Stan: All right! Let's do this!
Butters: Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.
Cartman: I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
Cartman: Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
Kyle: Go, fatass!
Cartman: When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
Lizzy: We've got' em, girls!
Kyle: Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
Kids at Finish Line: Go! You can do it! Come on!
Stan: We did it!
Kyle: We won! We won!
Butters: Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!
Boys: Hooray!
Kyle: It's good to have you back, Cartman.
Stan: Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
Cartman: Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
Stan, Kyle, Butters, Token: Naah.
Cartman: Sweet.
Romper Stomper: Eric!
Cartman: Hey, Romper Stomper.
Romper Stomper: Wow! I've never had a visitor before!
Cartman: Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
Cartman: You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
Romper Stomper: Oh, yeah!
Romper Stomper: Oh, the monorail!
Stan: Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
Kyle: Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
Stan: I know!
Mr. Garrison: Wendy?
Cartman: Phew!
Wendy: 1776.
Mr. Garrison: Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?
Cartman: Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
Kyle: The Declaration of Independence?
Timmy: Timmiihh!
Mr. Garrison: No, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again.
Timmy: Heh-aaaaaah!
Mr. Garrison: Timmy, did you not do your homework?!
Timmy: Erh Timmiihh!!
Stan: Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
Mr. Garrison: Don't call people names, Stanley!
Mr. Garrison: Now, Timmy,
Timmy: Haaaaah.
Mr. Garrison: You need to work on your study skills!
Timmy: Doo-uhh.
Mr. Garrison: Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office!
Timmy: G'oh livin' a lie, livin' a lie, Timmawh!
Mr. Garrison: THAT DOES IT!
Principal Victoria: Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention.
Timmy: Heh-aaaaaah!
Mr. Mackey: Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?!
Timmy: Timmiihh!
Timmy: Ehhha-a-a-ah.
Mr. Mackey: Yes, of course.
Principal Victoria: What??
Principal Victoria: Oh!
Principal Victoria: Well, that certainly would explain it.
Mr. Mackey: It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay?
Clinic Doctor: Alright, this is a very simple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit Disorder.
Principal Victoria: Good.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay.
Timmy: Timmih.
Clinic Doctor: Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you a book called, "The Great Gatsby," by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I'll ask you a few questions. Are you ready?
Timmy: Ha-a-a-a-a-h.
Clinic Doctor: Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby drive?
Clinic Doctor: This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder!
Principal Victoria: What can we do for him, doctor?
Clinic Doctor: Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today. I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and we'll see how that goes for little Timmy.
Timmy: Tim-mih.
Stan: He doesn't have to do homework?
Mr. Garrison: That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!
Timmy: Timmih.
Mr. Garrison: Very well, I guess you're excused from homework.
Cartman: Yeah, me too.
Stan: I've got ADD.
Kenny: (Me too.)
Other classmates: Yeah, I've got it. Me too. Yeah. It's gay.
Drummer: Dude, we suck!
Skyler: Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!
Mark: Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting.
Skyler: We've just gotta practice more.
Jonesy: Dude, we've been practicing for eight years, Skyler.
Mark: Who is that?
Timmy: Timmiihh!
Skyler: You a singer, man?
Jonesy: Dude, that's hot!
Skyler: Yeah!
Pharmacist: There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick. A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin.
Mrs. McCormick: And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?
Sharon: Oh, hi, Sheila.
Sheila: Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?
Sharon: Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.
Sheila: I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.
Liane: Yes.
Cartman: That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
Liane: Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?
Pharmacist: Oh, no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all.
Liane: Alright.
Pharmacist: Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected.
Liane: Oh my.
Band: Look alive, lettin' it feel (so light). Lettin' it feel so light.
People in Audience: Boooo!
M.C.: Alright, that was "Sisters of Mercy Hold No Pain Against the Dark Lord," with their song, "Silk Blood On The Footsteps Of My Mind (Revisited)"
Singer: We got the best response. We'll be opening for Phil Collins for sure.
M.C.: And now it's time for our final band.
Man 1: Duhude, that handicapped dude ruhules!
Man 2: Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah!
Man 3: You guys are terrible! How could you laugh at that poor kid?!
Stan: Dude, it's Timmy.
Cartman: That was awesuhome!
Stan: Yeah, Timmy ruhules!
Stan: But he's funny.
Kyle: He looks pretty happy to me.
M.C.: Dude, this is a no-brainer. This year's Battle of the Bands winner and the band that gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalablala is... TIMMY!
Phil Collins: Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself!
Kyle: Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?
Stan: Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
Stan: Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
Chef: Hello there, children.
Stan, Kyle, Cartman: Hello, Chef.
Kenny: (Hello, Chef.)
Chef: How's it goin'?
Stan, Kyle, Cartman: Very well, thank you.
Kenny: (Very well, thank you.)
Stan: Because we're on Ritalin.
Chef: What??
Kyle: We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
Kyle: That's correct, Chef.
Chef: Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!
Kyle: Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
Stan: Oh boy oh boy.
Kenny: (Oh boy.)
Chef: Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects.
Stan: But there are no side effects, Chef.
Cartman: Did you guys see that?
Stan: See what?
Announcer: You're watching MTV, the cool, brainwashing, twelve-year-old-and-younger station that hides behind a slick image. We're so cool that we decide what's cool. And now, MTV News, the news that is singlehandedly dumbing down our country. Which is cool. Here's your host, Kurt Loder.
Richard: Richarrrrd!
Helen: Helennnn!
Richard: 'Oodleahah.
Cartman: Whah!
A singer: Thank you, Baltimore! Good night!
Phil Collins: Excuse me, Skyler Morse?
Phil Collins: Nice to meet you. I'm Phil Collins.
Skyler: Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla.
Phil Collins: I just wanted to tell you that, well, I think that you're a great guitar player and song writer.
Phil Collins: It's too bad those other guys are holdin' you back.
Phil Collins: Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you. Strange, how everyone focuses n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the name of the band is "Timmy,"
Skyler: Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.
Jonesy: What's the matter, Skyler?
Skyler: The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy.
Timmy: Timmiihh!
Skyler: And the Lords of the Underworld!
Timmy: Timmiihh!
Skyler: It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!
Mark: Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous.
Timmy: Timmiihh!
Timmy: Ooo livin' a lie!
Phillip: Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?
Phillip: How do you like that, Terrance?
Stan: Let's watch something else.
Announcer: You're watching VH1.
The Boys: Ahhhh.
Anchor: Here's Lalapalalala's news. The hit group Timmy has broken up.
Stan: Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
Anchor: And so, Phil Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler.
Kyle: You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
Stan: Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
Cartman: I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
Kyle: Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
Stan: Sounds good.
Stan: Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.
Kyle: Bastard.
Randy: Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.
Dr. Shay: Sit down and study!
Chef: Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.
Sharon: That video had pretty colors.
Gerald: It sure did.
Chef: What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!
Parents: Yes.
Stan: Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
Chef: The what?
Kyle: Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.
Parents: Yes.
Kyle: Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
Chef: Oh my God!!
Kyle: Come, see him with us.
Chef: That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!
Pharmacist: Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points.
Pharmacist: Can I help you?
Chef: Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!
Clinic Doctor: Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit-
Chef: I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.
Clinic Doctor: Huh?
Chef: All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!
Clinic Doctor: Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-
Chef: You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!
Chef: That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!
Chef: Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!
Clinic Doctor: We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them.
Chef: Then we need an antidote!
Pharmacist: Yes, of course.
Clinic Doctor: Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?
Randy: Wasn't that great, son?
Stan: Sure was, Dad.
Gerald: It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
Chef: Come on, drink it down. It's free.
Stan: I feel... different.
Stan: Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
Kyle: Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
Audience: Booooo!!
Stan: Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
Kyle: Yeah!
Phil Collins: You just wanna laugh at him.
Kyle: Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!
Audience: Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!
The Lords: Alright!
Host: Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, it is my pleasure to introduce the reunion tour of Timmehuh!
Randy: Okay, is everyone ready to go?
Sheila: Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville.
Liane: Oh, don't they look precious?
Stan: Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
Kyle: Awwww!
Sharon: Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts!
Grandpa: Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch of frogs prance around in tights and make-up wrappin' their peckers around each other's faces!
Sheila: Oh, this is so exciting
Sharon: Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley.
Kyle: How long does this thing last?
Stan: Two hours.
Cartman, Kyle, Kenny: Awwwgh.
Stan, Kyle, Cartman: Yayy!
Kenny: (Oh yeah! Woohoo!)
Sheila: Oh, that was wonderful!
Sharon: Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again.
Kyle: Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
Cartman: Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
Kyle: Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
Stan: Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Grandmama: Hurry up, girls. We must bundle up against the cold.
A Quint: Did we do good final show, Grandmama?
Romanian official: Mrs. Vladchick, it is time. It is time to return to Romania.
Quint #2: Vhy are we going out the window, Grandmama?
Romanian official: Nid kelmin da bushka.
Attendant: Nid kelmin da lushka velt
Romanian official: Dash fam da bushka!
Native paddler in vest: Where to, Mack?
Stan: Dude, this isn't working.
Kyle: It's Kenny's singing!
Kenny: (Hunh?)
Cartman: Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!
Kenny: (I'm singing as good as I can!)
Grandpa: Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders.
Top Girl: Did we do good, Grandmama?
Grandmama: Very good, Glacas.
Stan: I'm tired, Grandpa.
Grandmama: We are very sorry to disturb you. My granddaughters are cold and tired. Is there any possibility we could pay you for a place to sleep?
Grandmama: Yes. We- missed our train. If we could shelter here; it would only be for one night.
Randy: Well...
Sharon: There's some spare bedrooms upstairs, Mrs....?
Grandpa: That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass.
Randy: Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!
Grandpa: Well, it's good for 'im.
Kenny: (Yaaayaya.)
Kenny: (Hehyayaya hehyayaya!)
Kenny: (...partir.)
Kenny: (Su navi per mari)
Grandmama: Yes. You're avefully soo kind to my little granddaughters.
Kenny: (che, io lo so,)
Grandpa: They're quite agile little things, aren't they?
Kenny: (no, no, non esistono pi.)
Grandmama: Yes, as I was back in my day. I was a contortionist, too.
Kenny: (con te io li rivivr.)
Grandmama: Yes.
Grandpa: You...
Kenny: (Con te...)
Narrator: And now lesson 4: the complete works of Mozart. Let's begin.
Sharon: What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer.
Randy: Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.
Sharon: Poor dear must be tired.
Randy: Huh?
Stan: Hurry up, you guys!
Cartman: What's going on?
Stan: Dude, you're not gonna believe this.
Quint 1: Hello.
Quint 2: Hello.
Quint 3: Hi.
Quint 4: Hello.
Cartman: No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
Stan: Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.
Kyle: What's a "quin-tuplet"?
Quint 2: Ve are twins, except there are five of us instead of two.
Kyle: But there's only four of you.
Quint 2: No no, Natalia is just playing mirror buddies with Nadia.
All five quints in unison: No, don't be ridiculous.
A Quint: You have your own?
Stan: Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
Kenny: (Hey!)
Quint 1: Okay.
Quint 3: Sounds good.
Quint 2: Count me in.
Quint 4: ...Oh, and me.
The boys: All right!
Grandpa: A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr.
Randy: No, Dad, she's dead!
Randy: It looks like she had a heart attack.
Grandpa: No wonder she didn't say good-night.
Randy: Uh, girls, we... have some bad news.
Quint 5: What?
Quint 2: Grandmama is dead?
Stan: What?!
Kyle: How can you say that?
Cartman: Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
Randy: Well, Stan, it's not really our-
Sharon: Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay.
Stan, Kyle: Hooray!
Cartman: Hooray!
Reporter: Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania.
President: This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid.
Romanian Official: This could kill our tourism.
Mrs.McCormick: Well, what do you think? Can you help him become a better singer?
Instructor: Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be.
Kenny: (Europe?)
Mrs.McCormick: We can't afford that.
Instructor: Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack.
Kenny: (Awww.)
Mrs.McCormick: Well, Kenny, if it means that much to you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and... you can sing on the way to make money.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Anchor Tom: ...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago.
Randy: Uh-oh.
Stan: That's your dad?
Quint 2: Maybe.
Quint 1: But we haven't seen papa for more than five years.
Man: How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.
Man: Nadia, my sweet Barshta
Randy: I don't know.
Cartman: Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
Cartman: Damn, we might be screwed.
Kenny: (Woo hoo!)
Romanian Official: Our home is Romania. We love it there.
Mr. Vladchick: Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there.
Janet Reno: Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest.
Romanian Official: Protest?
Janet Reno: Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things.
All three men: Oh.
Protesters: Let the quints stay! Romania is gay! Let the quints stay! Romania is gay!
Protesters: Romania sucks! Romania sucks!
Protester: Nooo!
Protesters: Boooo!
Stan: Okay, let's try it again. Hup!
Kyle: Alright!
Sharon: Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania.
Stan: No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
Kyle: Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
Soldier: Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the plan.
Janet Reno: Right.
Soldier: We'll drop you on the northwest corner of the backyard. You hop into the back of the house and find the quintuplets. When you see them, you say...
Janet Reno: "Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny."
Soldier: Good. And then hand them the Easter eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready?
Janet Reno: Ready.
Soldier: Code blue!
Music Instructor: Lad, we would like very much to have you here at the Romanian Music School.
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Mrs. McCormick: How much is all this gonna cost?
Mrs. McCormick: Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Terrance: Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb.
Quint 2: Oh, look. An Easter egg.
Officer 2: Find them!
Officer 3: Freeze, asshole!
Grandpa: Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya!
Officer 3: Don't push me, man!
Grandpa: Pull the trigger, you little pussy!
Music Instructor: Oh, your son is so talented, Ms. McCormick. The people of Romania love him.
Mrs. McCormick: Good job, Kenny.
Music Instructor: Mrs. McCormick, we would love for you and your son to stay here in Romania, with us. Will you consider it?
Kenny: (Sure!)
Music Instructor: Alright!
Sharon: Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!
Stan: The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
Kyle: Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!
Stan: Yeah! Well, not this time!
Cartman: Huh?
Protester 1: Hmm.
Protester 2: Yeaahh.
Protester 3: I don't know. I usually like to stop protesting by 5:30.
Protester 4: Yeah, ah, do we get overtime for this?
Stan: Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.
Protester 6: Yeah!
Stan: Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
Soldier: Aaa-a-a-aaa-ah.
Officer 8: Let's move. Move!
Officer 7: Come on, come on, come on.
Officer 10: This is government property!
Quint 1: What are you doing, Nadia?
Quint 1: All of you are acting like idiots!
Stan: Yeah.
Quint 1: None of you care about us. You only care about yourselves!
Cartman: Yeah, you suck, dude!
Cartman: Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!
Cartman: Yeah!
Quint 3: And you boys are the worst of all!
Stan, Kyle, Cartman: Huh?
Stan: Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
Cartman: Yeah, screw them!
Kyle: Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
Stan: Whatever happened to Kenny?
Romanian Protesters: Boooo!
Mrs. McCormick: Okay, okay!
Stan: Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
Stan: Um, deny it?
Stan: Sweet.
Kyle: What?
Cartman: I just gave you AIDS.
Stan: Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
Mrs. McCormick: Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?
Kenny: (No.)
Stan: You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
Kyle: What?
Kyle: You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
Electronic Head: I'm Bill Kurtis.
Tony: Yeah. You're -Eric?
Tony: Yahahahah like having your back rubbed?
Agent: Hold it right there, scumbag!
Cartman: Huh?
Mom: You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save food for the baby.
Dad: Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby.
Mom: Kenny, you have to change the baby's diapers!
Dad: You have to share your room with the baby!
Mom: The baby.
Dad: The baby!
Mom: The baby!!
Stuart: Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again.
Kenny: (Dad, I wanna play catch.)
Stuart: Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son.
Kenny: (But I wanna play now!)
Mrs. McCormick: Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.
Stuart: Aw, alright.
Cartman: Mr. Garrison??
Cartman: You wanna be my friend?
Mr. Garrison: Oh, crap!
Cartman: That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
Agent: Alright, scumbag, we got you!
Mr. Garrison: No-o!
Stan: Oh, man, that's terrible.
Stan: We don't know.
Kyle: We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
Cartman: Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
Mr. Garrison: I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady: Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants.
Tony: Do you like having your back rubbed?
Mr. Garrison: Eat me, pervert!
Man: We demand you release these men at once!
Officer Barbrady: Who are you?
Man: We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?
Officer Barbrady: Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters.
Man: Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!
Man: Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
Other NAMBLA Men: Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
Cartman: Dr. Mephesto, I need help.
Dr. Mephesto: Well of course, come in.
Cartman: Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
Dr. Mephesto: Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA.
Cartman: NAMBLA?
Dr. Mephesto: Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.
Dr. Mephesto: Sure!
Members: Awwww.
Eager Man: Yeh-hehah-hah.
Cartman: Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
NAMBLA leader: You... do?
Cartman: Sure.
Mrs. McCormick: Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister.
Mrs. McCormick: Yup, it's for sure!
Stuart: And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!
Kyle: Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.
Stan: Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
Kyle: What are you talking about, fatass?
Pharmacist: Can I help you, young lady?
Kenny: (Cash.)
Mrs. McCormick: Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me.
Mrs. McCormick: But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink.
Kenny: (What?)
Mrs. McCormick: What's the matter?
Kenny: (Uh oh.)
NAMBLA Member: Just a few more pictures, Eric. You make a perfect poster child.
NAMBLA leader: Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready.
Cartman: KIIICK ASS!
Announcer: Note: people with heart conditions and expectant mothers should not ride the JOHN DENVER! Open now! Come on down!
Stuart: Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
Stuart: Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!
Mrs. McCormick: Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom.
Kyle: They are?
Kyle: We don't WANNA go!
Stan: Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
Kyle: Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
Kenny: (Eeww.)
Dr. Doctor: I can see its head!
Ms. McCormick: You can?
Stuart: Oh my God, it killed Kenny!
Ms.McCormick: Bad baby, bad!
Stan: We got invited too, fatass!
NAMBLA Leader: First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys.
NAMBLA Leader: Now, I know that many of us have already found partners in this fahine city, and I'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members.
Stan: This is boring.
Member 1: Ho hohohoho
Butters: Well, uh I sure am, I guess.
NAMBLA Leader: Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you, Mr. Harris?
Timmy: TIMMMIHH, tih, Timmih?
Lead Agent: Alright, I want those perverted bastards all taken in. Got it?
Agents: Got it!
Agent 1: Freeze!
Agent 2: Don't nobody move!
Mephesto: What children?
Lead Agent: This... is... NAMBLA, right?
Mephesto: Yes.
Lead Agent: The North American Man/Boy Love Association?
Blond Agent: Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA.
Mephesto: Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?!
Lead Agent: You know of them?
Blond Member: Know of them? We've been fighting with them for years over the rights to nambla.com!
Brunet Member: Yeah, those perverted bastards!
Mephesto: Thank you. Now, let's go get those other NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any of South Park's children!
Members: Yeah! Yeah!
Black Member: And let's kick their asses for stealin' our domain name!
Members: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Member 3: All right.
Member 4: Alright.
Stan: Yeah.
NAMBLA Leader: Everyone come up and grab your room keys and we'll head upstairs, hm hm.
Stan: Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
Mrs. McCormick: Kenny, GIVE IT UP!
Lead Agent: Alright, you're under arrest!
Mephesto: No! You've got the wrong NAMBLA again!
Lead Agent: Damnit!
Cartman: They're all over the place.
Timmy: Timmiihhh!
The Boys: Yeah.
Cartman: Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
Kyle: How?
Butters: Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?
Cartman: Now, are you a team player or not?!
Butters: Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
Cartman: Well, Butters, there is no I in "team."
Butters: Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
Cartman: Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
Cartman: Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
Kyle: Dude. You have sex with children.
Stan: Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
Kyle: Seriously.
Kyle: Well, Cartman?
Cartman: Well, what?
Kyle: Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
The Boys: Yeah!
Cartman: Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
Stan: And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
Stuart: Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo.
Mrs. McCormick: Our little angel, yes.
Mrs. McCormick: What should we name him?
Stuart: Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.
Stuart: God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.
Mrs. McCormick: Fifty-second.
Mr. Wyland: Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?
Wendy: It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus.
Mr. Wyland: Okay, and where iiiiss Kenny McCormick?
Stan: Dude, what the hell was that?
Cartman: Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
Stan: ...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.
Cartman: Huh?
Stan: You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
Cartman: Not with me, man.
Mr. Wyland: Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it.
Mr. Wyland: Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too.
Cartman: But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
Mr. Wyland: I don't care! Get down here and do it!
Chairman: Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely.
Mr. Garrison: What??
Chairman: Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was?
Mr. Garrison: Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!
Principal Victoria: Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-
Chairman: We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice.
Chairman: Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!
Sheila: Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.
Sheila: They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.
Stan: Go on, Butters!
Butters: Ho, I don't wanna!
Stan: Butters, go on!
Stan: Dude, you really are sick, huh?
Kyle: I don't know, I...
Sheila: I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.
Sharon: Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.
Sheila: Really? In People?
Sharon: There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information."
Sheila: Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something.
Sharon: Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.
Butters: Can I go now?
Mr. Garrison: I've always wanted to write a novel.
Mr. Mackey: Well, there you go, m'kay?
Mr. Garrison: But I never know what to write about.
Mr. Mackey: Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?
Mr. Garrison: Besides teaching?
Mr. Mackey: Yes.
Mr. Garrison: ...Poontang.
Mr. Mackey: M, m'kay
Mr. Garrison: I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.
Mr. Mackey: Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.
Miss Information: You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins.
Sheila: Toxins?
Miss Information: All the horrible food we eatthe sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper.
Sharon: Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!
Stan: Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
Miss Information: What?
Stan: Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
Sharon: Don't be a smartass, Stanley.
Miss Information: Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans.
Mayor: Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?
Jimbo: Mayor, it's about the South Park flag.
Jimbo: We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!
Chef: You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!
Chef: Yeah!
Mr. Wyland: Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club.
Cartman: Thaaat's ri-ight.
Kyle: Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
Cartman: Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
Stan: You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
Cartman: Yes I do!
Craig: No you don't!
Kyle: Told ya.
Ned: Nnneh, in 1867, fourteen pioneers from the East Coast traveled across the Plains-
Stan: Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
Kyle: Yeah, we got it.
Jimbo: You sure?
Stan, Kyle: Yup.
Randy: Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.
Wendy: We'll march with you, Chef.
Mr. Mackey: Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon.
Chef: Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?
Mr. Mackey: Oh, yeah.
Principal Victoria: What about next Sunday?
Chef: Fine! Next Sunday!
Man 1: You mean, during the ball game?
Man 2: Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday.
Chef: Monday??
Principal Victoria: Oh, I can't do Monday.
Mr. Mackey: Yeah, Tuesday morning's good.
Man 1: You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.
Man 2: Saturday is perfect for me.
Principal Victoria: Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?
Man 3: Mm hmm.
Man 2, Woman 2: Yeah.
Man 1: Yeah.
Man 3: That sounds good.
Man 2: Mm hmm.
Mr. Mackey: Yeah, I think that's the best day.
Chef: Okay! On Saturday, we march!
Man 2: Oh, march? What are we marching for?
Chef: To bring down the South Park Flag!
Man 3: Oohh, I gotta go.
Man 1: I know what I may like. I don't like marching
Woman 2: Uh, marching's really not for me.
Man 2: See you later.
Mr. Wyland: Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, children, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay, and half think the flag should be changed.
Wendy: How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!
Mr. Wyland: Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the "Flag Should Stay The Way It Is" team?
Stan, Kyle: Me. Me. Me. Me.
Kyle: Yeah, me neither.
Mr. Wyland: Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate!
Stan, Kyle: Hello, Chef.
Stan: Islam??
Stan: Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
Kyle: Not really.
Stan: Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
Stan: But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
Wendy: Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-
Cartman: The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
Cartman: You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
Wendy: The South Park flag!
Wendy: D'aaaaahhh!
Chef: Change the flag!
Jimbo: Don't change history!
Mayor: Oh brother, what now?!
Man 5: Well, I guess the flag is part of history, but I can see how it is racist.
Reporter: Well, one things for sure, tensions are high and pressure is mounting on the South Park Mayor to do something.
Ned: Yeah.
Mr. Garrison: Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat.
The KKK: White Power!
Chef: Change the flag!
Jimbo: Don't change history!
Mayor: Ooh, Jesus. What a mess.
Chef: No, damnit!
Johnson: Mayor, the-ee South Park Elementary children are discussing the flag issue in their debate club on Friday.
Assistant: We could use the debate as an excuse to hold a vote on the issue.
Mayor: Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!
Wendy: This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-
Wendy: If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-
Wendy: Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!
Cartman: You won't let me help.
Wendy: That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!
Stan: Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
Kyle: Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!
Kenny: (Plenty. This is 'cause my family's poor.)
Kyle: I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
Stan: I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
Kyle: Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.
Kyle: Pretty good, I guess.
Kyle: Kenny ate all the mints, dad.
Gerald: Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.
Kyle: Oh.
Stan: That was a good one.
The KKK: White Power! White Power!
KKK Leader: Do not change the flag! It is a symbol of white power!
The KKK: White Power!
Officer Barbrady: Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking.
Reporter: Should the Klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the Capitol? Here's what some people think.
Man 7: Well, I think they are racist, but I do think freedom of speech is important.
Man 9: Well, I believe that they are racist, but I do believe that all-
KKK Leader: Well, that's enough rallying for this afternoon, members. Let's take a hot shower!
Wendy: Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.
Cartman: Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
Wendy: Huh?
Cartman: I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But, obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
Cartman: Yeah.
Cartman: Cool.
Cartman: Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make "quadruple stuffs."
Cartman: No way!
Wendy: Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman.
Wendy: Aha ha.
Cartman: Huh.
Cartman: Whoa.
Mr. Garrison: Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?
Mr. Garrison: Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting.
Mr. Garrison: Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!
Ned: Mmm-okay.
Jimbo: Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?
Ned: No.
The KKK: White Power! White Power!
Brother Anderson: Last week we decided we hate blacks and Jews. A lot!
KKK Leader: Alright. And now it's time for us all to come together, and do our cake raffle.
Wendy: Say it'll be like this forever.
Cartman: Okay, It will be like this forever.
Member 1: Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll burn down the Capitol!
KKK Members: Yeah!
Member 2: Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll never leave this town!
KKK Members: Yeah!
KKK Leader: Uh what's that, brother?
Jimbo: I think we should switch sides!
Ned: Me too. Nnn-that's a good idea.
Jimbo: Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?
KKK Leader: That's a great idea, brother!
KKK Leader: Alright, it is decided! We will officially tell everyone that we want the flag changed, so that they will all vote against us!
KKK Leader: Well alright, now that that's out of the way, it is time to play, "Whose got the silliest thing on under their robe?"
Ned: Mm-yup.
Jimbo: Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.
Bebe: Sure, what?
Wendy: Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman.
Wendy: Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-
Bebe: Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, "sexual tension." Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with.
Bebe: Kiss him and get it out of your system.
Kyle: Huh?
Chef: I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!
Chef: Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.
Chef: Ooooooohhh?!
Kyle: Y-yeah, but the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
Mayor: What?
Mr. Wyland: What?
A Few People: Awww.
Some KKK members: Awww.
Jimbo: Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.
Chef: Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man.
Jimbo: We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flagsomething that everybody can be happy with.
Chef: I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.
Kyle: No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
Chef: Hooray!
Cartman: Me, too!
Kyle: ...How?
Cartman: Boy band.
Stan: Boy band?
Cartman: Boy band.
Cartman: There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God!
Stan: Dude, we don't have any musical talent.
Kenny: (That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)
Kyle: Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
Cartman: So?
Kyle: So, all boy bands have five members.
Cartman: What?
Kyle: 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.
Stan: He's right.
Sharon: Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?
Stan: Well, I guess.
Sharon: What did you do?
Sharon: Oh well, that sounds nice.
Stan: Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
Shelly: Geez, what's up Dad's ass?
Butters: Ah, I can do it again.
Cartman: Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
Kyle: It was?
Stan: Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
Cartman: Kyle's brother?
Cartman: Christ's sake..!
Schroeder: What key?
Stan: Aw, come on, dude. Let her try.
Kyle: Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!
Kyle: Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
Stan: Come on, nobody's gonna notice.
Stan: She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
Kyle: Me too.
Kenny: (Me too.)
Cartman: Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
Cartman: Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
Stan: Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
Stan: Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
Cartman: 'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
Kyle: Jews are tough!
Cartman: Since when?!
Kyle: Since Abraham, fatass!
Stan: Hey, Cartman, what does "fingerbang" mean, anyways?
Stan: Kenny says that's not what it means.
Kenny: (It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)
Cartman: ...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
Cartman: We're goin' to see the mall manager.
Veteran Guard: Do you have the proper clearance?
Veteran Guard: You have to make an appointment first. Now move along, sir.
Kyle: Jesus Christ!
Stan: Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
Man: Nothin'. Just... shopping.
Woman: Nothing. Why?
Veteran Guard: That's what being a mall cop is all about. Hyeuup.
Rookie Guard: Cool.
Cartman: We... are Fingerbang!
Manager: O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.
Cartman: We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
Manager: What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?
Cartman: Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
Manager: Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?
Manager: Thank you.
Manager: What?? ...No.
Cartman: No??
Manager: Who?? No!
Cartman: Why not?!
Manager: Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?
Cartman: You don't think we're any good, do you?!
Manager: No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.
Kyle: Wow. I feel so rejected.
Stan: Yeah.
Veteran Guard: There you are! You're the hoodlums who got on the intercom and started an orange smoothie riot!
Stan: Uh-oh.
Veteran Guard: I will now read you your mall rights! You have the right to shop at a variety of malls in all--
Randy: Where is Stan?
Sharon: Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band.
Randy: What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
Sharon: Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.
Shelly: Mom, what's up Dad's ass?
Sharon: It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now.
Chef: Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.
Cartman: What's the Gomlich effect?
Chef: The law of physics that states, "If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."
Cartman: So how do boy bands use that?
Cartman: Thanks!
Chef: You're welcome. Now, go away!
Chef: A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
Cartman: Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!" Okay?
Bebe: Are we gonna get paid now, or after?
Kyle: Dude, what's wrong with your leg?
Timmy: Huhaaaaah!
Cartman: Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
Bebe: We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.
Other Girls (Red, Annie, and Milly): Yeah.
Cartman: Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
Girls: ...Matt Lauer.
Cartman: ...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
Cartman: Roll camera!
Cartman: Jesus Christ!
Bebe: Okay, so where's our money?
Stan: We are making a music video.
Stan: Dad, I was just a--
Stan: Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
Randy: Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.
Randy: Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?
Stan: No.
Randy: Well, maybe it's time.
Stan: Dad!
Veteran Guard: Ey! What are you doin'?
Madman: I've got a new strain of anthrax that I will soon unleash upon all of North America!
Veteran Guard: Move along, sir.
Manager: What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.
Cartman: I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
Manager: Oh. What?
Timmy: Timmiihh! [The camera turns left again and catches a glimpse of the girls, then ends up on Cartman, and zooms in on the cucumber]
Timmy: Haaghh. [waves at the camera, then moves his wheelchair back and dances to the music] Timmih, livin' a lie!
Cartman: Son of a bitch!
Manager: Hey. This video is dumb.
Cartman: Really? You will?
Manager: Only for twenty minutes, though.
Cartman: That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
Mr. Mackey: Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay? [he's handcuffed against a brick wall. Mrs. Cartman appears as a dominatrix]
Mr. Mackey: Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay? [Cartman is shocked at what he sees; the manager is pleased]
Cartman: Aw, Mom!
Manager: Wow. What?
Stan: It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
Randy: Because I said so!
Stan: Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
Randy: Let 'em be pissed off, then!
Stan: I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
Stan: Dad? What the hell is going on?
Producer: Kid, can I talk to you?
Randy: Uh sure.
Producer: Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town.
Randy: Ohh, thanks.
Producer: Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
Randy: What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
Producer: Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?
Randy: Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--
Producer: Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--
Randy: And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
Randy: ...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
Randy: ...And I left my family.
Producer: Take 112!
Randy: Hey, Mr. Allens.
Mr. Allens: Heh? Woh. Uh... R-Randy.
Randy: But, w-we're still selling records, right?
Mr. Allens: Look, kid, you're just getting a little... old to be in a boy band.
Randy: I'm 19.
Randy: They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...
Randy: ...the women all left...
Randy: ...and they took back my house.
Randy: The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.
Stan: Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
Cartman: Where the hell is Stan?!
Kyle: He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
Cartman: Yes. Yes, sir, any secondwe're just waiting on one more member.
Kyle: Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Cartman: Oh, god-dammit!
Randy: Huh? Yeah?
Stan: Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
Stan: Yeah.
Randy: You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?
Stan: Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
Randy: Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.
Stan: Really?
Randy: Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
Man: What's happening here?
Woman: I don't know, uh. I guess nothing.
Cartman: Just another minute.
Kyle: Dude, where the hell have you been?!
Manager: Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up.
Stan: Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle: You bastards!
Kyle: Dude, he's pretty dead.
Cartman: No! We were so close!
Manager: Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!
Cartman: But we have to perform!
Kyle: We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!
Stan: Oh, yes we do.
Cartman: Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
Kyle: We made two dollars.
Stan: You were great, Dad.
Randy: Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
Little Girl: Can I get your autograph?
Cartman: Ok-Okay, okay.
Kyle: Yeah.
Kyle: ...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
Stan: Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
Kenny: (It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
Cartman: No no, no. Separation.
Stan: "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"
Gene Siskel: I do!
Satan: Yeah!
Gary: Great luau, Satan.
Satan: Thanks. See ya, Gary. Thanks for comin'. Oh- Hi, Marsha.
Walter: Satan, a few of us are gonna go pound some brews. You wanna join us?
Satan: Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Matthau, but I can't. Chris and I just moved to the west side and we have to unpack.
Walter: Oh, well, maybe next time. Great luau!
Satan: Bye.
Satan: Chris?
Satan: Did you, uh, see my "Boy With An Umbrella" Hummel?
Chris: Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers.
Satan: No, it can't be! You're dead! I killed you!
Stan: Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.
Randy: Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death.
Saddam: Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk.
Satan: I don't want to talk to you, Saddam! This isn't what I need in my life right now.
Satan: Okay, Chris.
Satan: I can't, Saddam. I'm with Chris now.
Saddam: Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!
Satan: Good-bye, Saddam!
Nun: Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And I'll be teaching you so that you can all receive your First Communion.
Sister Anne: Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion.
Cartman: A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
Stan: What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
Cartman: Jesus was made of crackers?
Sister Anne: No.
Stan: But crackers are his- body.
Sister Anne: Yes.
Sister Anne: In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, "eat this, for it is my body."
Cartman: So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
Sister Anne: Nononono!
Butters: Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?
Stan: Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
Sister Anne: No!
Stan: No??
Butters: Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
Sister Anne: Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?!
Kenny, Stan, Cartman: O-kay.
Sister Anne: And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ.
Sister Anne: Eric, do you wanna go to hell?!
Sister Anne: Then stop questioning me.
Cartman: But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
Sister Anne: No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confession.
Kenny: (OH, SHIT!)
Chris: Those were some great pork chops, Satan.
Satan: Yeah.
Chris: Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly.
Satan: Well, Chris, Saddam showed up today.
Satan: He showed up spouting all kinds of things about how he's changed and he still loves me...
Chris: I thought you... killed him.
Satan: Yeah, well, where was he gonna go? Detroit?
Chris: ...Do you still love him?
Satan: No, Chris.
Chris: It's okay of you do.
Chris: Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults.
Satan: What?
Chris: We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy.
Satan: No, Chris, you don't understand. Saddam is fucking crazy.
Stan: Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
Cartman: Oh yeah, okay.
Stan: And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
Cartman: Right, I already got that one.
Stan: We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
Kyle: Uhwuwhat?
Kyle: No-o-o-o-o!
Cartman: Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
Kyle: Oh good. I don't?
Cartman: No, you're already going to hell.
Kyle: I am not!
Cartman: You are, too!
Stan: Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
Stan: Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
Cartman: Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
Kenny: (What?)
Stan: What, Butters?
Butters: Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
Timmy: Timmiih!
Cartman: What'd we do to Timmy?
Butters: No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!
Timmy: Timmiih!
Cartman: Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.
Stan: Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
Kenny: (What are we gonna do?)
Chris: I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.
Satan: What?
Chris: Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight.
Satan: You WHAT?!
Chris: I just think we all need to get this out in the open.
Satan: No, Chris! He'll try to kill you is what he'll do!
Chris: Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore.
Stan: Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
Stan: Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!
Cartman: Huh?
Stan: The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
Cartman: Who's in there?
Stan: I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
Cartman: Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
Stan: ...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
Stan: God damnit!
Kenny: (What??)
Sister Anne: Oh, hello, children.
Stan: We have a question.
Stan: Where do handicapped people go when they die?
Stan: But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
Cartman: And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
Cartman: Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
Stan: What happened??
Chris: Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein.
Chris: Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?
Chris: Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready.
Gerald: Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day.
Ike: Cookie monstooh.
Sheila: Why? What did you do, Kyle?!
Kyle: Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
Sheila: Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.
Kyle: We don't? But what if we're wrong?
Sheila: Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too.
Ike: Oh, no.
Ike: No-o-o.
Sheila: Kyle!
Chris: So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.
Satan: It's all vegetarian, Saddam. Chris was a nutritionist before he died.
Saddam: Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?
Chris: Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy.
Saddam: An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!
Saddam: Uh huh.
Sister Anne: Father, the children asked me about their handicapped friend. I wanna explain to them that he's fine.
Priest Maxi: Well, has your friend ever confessed or been baptized?
Stan: I don't think so.
Priest Maxi: Then, hell awaits him.
Sister Anne: Father, these boys are really worried because they think they have to-
Priest Maxi: They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!
Sister Anne: Yes, but-
Priest Maxi: Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right?
Kyle: Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
Priest Maxi: Well, young man, you can rest assured that according to Matthew 25, when you die you will stand before God and he will will say, "Depart from me, you cursd, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels." Yes! As a Jew, your home will be the lake of fire.
Sister Anne: Father-
Stan: Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.
Kyle: HAAAAH!
Cartman: Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
Stan: Cartman!
Cartman: What?
Stan: Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!
Cartman: Oh, now you've said it, too!
Cartman: Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
Stan: But what about them?
Timmy: Haaaaah!
Timmy: Haaa-ay, Timmmiih!
Satan: Good. I'll show you out.
Chris: Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!
Satan: He's stable, Saddam!
Saddam: Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!
Satan: Having stability in your life is a great thing! You should try it!
Satan: I'm very happy with my life now.
Satan: No, Saddam! I won't be needing this!
Secretary: Yes, I understand you want to speak-a wit the pope.
Sister Anne: Yes. The priest here has been telling the children some pretty radical things, and I just wanted to see what the Church thinks about Jews and the mentally handicapped.
The Pope: Heh??
Sister Anne: Hello, His Holiness. I want to ask you about people with mental disabilities.
The Pope: Heh?
Sister Anne: Do mentally-challenged people go to hell?
Stan: Come on! This stupid light won't change.
Stan: We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
Butters: Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
Butters: He had sins that he didn't confess!
Cartman: And he never took Communion!
Stan: He's doomed.
Satan: Chris, what are you doing?
Chris: I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too.
Satan: Oh boy.
Satan: Chris, just... don't... don't do that.
Chris: But it turns you on.
Satan: No, it's a- When Saddam did it, yeah, but uh...
Chris: But what?
Satan: I love you too, Saddam.
Chris: It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do.
Chris: Yeah. Sure. Okay.
Woman: Oh, huhuh.
Stan: You're a sinner!
Cartman: You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
Cartman: Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
Stan: Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
Cartman: Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
Randy: Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!
Cartman: There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
Sheila: Us Jews don't believe in hell.
Kyle: But what if we're wrong?
Butters: He had sins that he didn't confess!
Satan: No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now.
Priest Maxi: Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!
Satan: I love you too, Saddam.
Fonzie: Aaaay! I've gotta try, Richie.
Stan: Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
Cartman: Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
Joanie: Go Fonz!!!
Kids: Yeah!
Sharon: We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school.
Stan: What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
Kyle: Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.
Principal Victoria: Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.
Cartman: Praise God-uh!
Satan: Saddam, I only came here because I need closure.
Saddam: Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.
Satan: No! Saddam, listen to me.
Saddam: Would you like a drink?
Saddam: These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.
Satan: Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now.
Saddam: Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?
Satan: I don't know. I-I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris.
Saddam: Screw him!!
Saddam: I know how to solve this little problem.
Attendant: Oiga. Hay algo pegado bajo el autobus. ["Listen. There's something stuck under the bus."]
Kenny: (Ahow..!)
Attendant: Pienso que s. ["I think so." Kenny stands up]
Kenny: (Where am I?)
Attendant: Qu?
Attendant: Qu?
Cartman: This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
Stan: There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
Kyle: Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
Sheila: I sure hope this works.
Liane: Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.
Stan: Wow, cool.
Cartman: No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
Liane: What?
Stan: Yeah!
Liane: I... don't think it worked.
All: Aww.
Stan: What?
Cartman: It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
Cartman: Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
Chris: Hey, you.
Chris: You... were out all night.
Satan: Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina.
Chris: Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?
Chris: I still feel secure and safe with you.
Satan: I know.
Chris: Well, what more do you want from me?
Chris: Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.
Satan: Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous, go throw a football around, for Christ's sake.
Chris: Agghhh!
Kids: Wagghh..!
Cartman: He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
Kids: Whoa!
Cartman: And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
Father: Where is our daughter?
Father: Marcy! You're coming home this instant!
Father: You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!
Cartman: Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
Cartman: The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
Kids: Forgive us, Lord.
Stephen: Where... where am I?
Man: Where are we?
Man 2: No doubt about it...
Woman: What's happening??
Man 3: Oooooooooh!
Man 4: Hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here. I was a totally strict and devout Protestant! I thought we went to heaven!
Hell Director: Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong.
Soldier: I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness.
Hell Director: Uh, you picked the wrong religion as well.
Man 5: Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven?
Hell Director: I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer.
Hell Director: So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan.
Crowd: Aaggghh!
Hell Director: Uh, okay. Thank you, Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims...
Chris: Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?
Satan: Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in--
Chris: Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?
Satan: Uh... yeah. Gr-great.
Crowd: Awww.
Cartman: Sister, have you read this book?
Sister Anne: Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have.
Cartman: Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
Sister Anne: Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their lives.
Cartman: Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
Sister Anne: No.
Cartman: Well...
Saddam: Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!
Chris: Yeah. It's me.
Saddam: I thought I killed you!
Chris: Yeah...
Saddam/Chris: Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?
Saddam: Right, right.
Chris: Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?
Chris: Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.
Chris: No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?
Chris: Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.
Saddam: Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?
Chris: Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them.
Saddam: Ah hahaha!
Cartman: Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
Kyle: Yes!
Cartman: Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
Kyle: Yes!
Cartman: Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
Cartman: Praise the Lord-uh!
Butters: Huh-Hallelujah!
Timmy: Timmiiiy!
Cartman: We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
Timmy: Timmiiiy!
Timmy: Haagggh.
Timmy: Haagggh.
Timmy: Haghh.
Cartman: He walks-uh!
Kids: Whoa!
Cartman: Yes! Praise the Lord!
Kids: Praise the Lord!
JonBent Ramsey: Wow, that really sucks.
Satan: I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer.
JonBent Ramsey: Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice.
Satan: Who?
JonBent Ramsey: God.
JonBent Ramsey: Well then, maybe it's time.
Boy: Denver.
Cartman: And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
Boy: Yeah, that's right.
Kids: Wooooo!
Kids: Hooray!
Ugly Girl: Yes!
Ugly Girl: Wagh...
All: Lord, Lord, Lord
Mormon 1: Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've followed the Mormon faith, and so you've been let in!
Satan: Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by.
Mormon 2: Well, you've picked a great time! We've got cookies and punch and we're just about to start playing charades.
Mormon 1: And then, Brother Stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie.
Mormons: Ooooh!
Mormon 3: Yeahahah!
Satan: Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around?
Mormon 2: Sure. All you have to do is say his name and he's there.
Mormon 1: I'm so grateful for that.
Satan: Hi, God.
Satan: Yeah.
God: What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?
Satan: No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice.
God: You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?
Stan: Dude, that seems kind of... weird.
Kyle: Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
Satan: ...And now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick.
Satan: Huh?
God: You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.
Satan: Well, I just don't know which one to pick.
Satan: God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself.
Satan: Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes.
God: It was nice to see you again, Satan.
Satan: You too.
Mormon 2: Would you like to stay for some cookies and punch?
Mormon 1: Yes, would you?
Satan: Uh, no, I need to be getting back.
Mormon 2: Oh, alright then, but you're gonna miss our big play.
Mormon 4: Yes. We're going to do a play about how alcohol can ruin family life.
Mormon 1: Well, he seemed like a nice fellow.
Mormon 2: Let's go make things out of egg cartons.
Stan: What worked?
Cartman: Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
Stan/Kyle: What?
Kyle: You're keeping that money yourself?
Stan: Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
Cartman: It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
Cartman: Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
Cartman: My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
Kyle: The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
Stan: Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.
Chris: You have?
Satan: Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you.
Chris/Saddam: What?!
Chris: Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?
Satan: No, I'm not going on a walk! You're a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy; go away!
Cartman: Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
Butters: Jesus!
Jesus: Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.
Jesus: God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him.
Bebe: Let's go ice-skating.
Butters: Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.
Kyle: Serves you right, Cartman!
Stan: Yeah!
Jesus: But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!
Cartman: You're gonna send me to hell?
Jesus: No. Worse!
Rick: Hi, Satan.
Satan: Saddam, I told you, I don't need you anymore!
Saddam: You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me.
Saddam: Aw, you little..prick!
Satan: Goodbye forever, Saddam!
Satan: Not this time. I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in.
Saddam: What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!
Mormon 5: Hello, and welcome.
Mormon 1: We're glad you made it, brother.
Saddam: Ey, who the hell are you?
Stan: Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
Kyle: Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!
Younger Boy: What?
Stan: What grade are you going into?
Younger Boy: Thi-ird
Stan: Stupid third grader!
Younger Boy: Uhuhuhow.
Cartman: There, that's better.
Kyle: You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
Clyde: Like what?
The Kids: YEAH!!!
Stan: ...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
Kyle: ...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
Stan: Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"
The Kids: YEAH!!!
Stan: We got you covered, Timmy.
Timmy: Timmay!
Kyle: Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?
Butters: Huhuh, look at all this stuff.
Kyle: Holy God, dude!
New Teacher: My name is Ms. Choksondik.
Cartman: I'm trying.
Ms. Choksondik: Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.
Stan: What a bitch!
Kyle: And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
Cartman: You guys are all such pussies!
Kyle: I just didn't think it would come so soon.
Cartman: Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
Kyle: Huh?
Kyle: Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
Butters: Huh-it sure was.
Stan: Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
Kyle: How?
Kyle: Oh yeah, time travel.
Kyle: Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
Cartman: Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
Nerd #1: When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-
Cartman: Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
Nerd #2: Time-travel is no laughing matter. Four times the Enterprise went back in time, and four times they almost didn't make it back.
Nerd #1: Oh.
Kyle: So can you do it?
Timmy: Tuh-timmih?
Principal Victoria: Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!
Chef: What's the problem?
Mr. Mackey: Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra.
Chef: You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.
Chef: Oooo! Call the doctor!
Ms. Choksondik: My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across!
Principal Victoria: Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade.
Principal Victoria: Oh? Which one?
Principal Victoria: I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.
Ms. Choksondik: Why?! Where did he go?!
The Adults: Aww Oooo!
Nerd #2: If the fields are right, it should then create a wormhole up near the front of the classroom.
Wendy: You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?
Nerd #1: Now, eh, when you all see a wormhole, yuh-you guys are gonna have about 4.2 seconds to run through it.
Nerd #2: And on the other side you will find yourself in exactly the same spot, only one year ago.
Stan: Back in the third grade.
Kids: Cool/Wow.
Kyle: I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
Kids: Yeah!
Stan: Oh! Here she comes.
Ms. Choksondik: It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!
Nerd #1: Primary fusion initiated.
Timmy: Aa-aa-ah!
Ms. Choksondik: What are you doing?!
Nerd #1: I didn't think it would work.
Nerd #2: Me neither.
Ms. Choksondik: Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!
Cartman: You're damn right they do!
Kyle: Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
Stan: Yeah!
Ms. Choksondik: Children! Children, come back here!
Stan: Timmy, you have to stop!
Nerd #1: No!
Stan: No??
Nerd #1: Look, the system malfunctions if he stops. The nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high.
Kyle: What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
Nerd #1: No!
Nerd #2: We've rigged the chair to be sensitive to his weight. If he gets off, the whole thing blows!
Stan: So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
The Nerds: Yup.
Stan: My God!
Stan: Over here, over here!
Anchor Tom: The child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion, and so the SWAT team will now attempt to disarm the device.
Pilot: Look out, Hansen!
Brunette: Aaaah!
Timmy: Timmaaay!
Brunette: Oh my God, what's going on?
Hansen: Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair is set to explode!
Hansen: It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the speed above 5!
Brunette: Okay. I kept the speed at 5.
Hansen: Good! What's the wheelchair's battery power at?
Brunette: Oh my God! Less than 20 minutes!
Stan: Less than 20 minutes?!
Kyle: Oh no! What have we done?!
Ms. Choksondik: I HAVE HAD IT!!!
Principal Victoria: As we said before, that's impossible.
Ms. Choksondik: What in God's name happened to him?
Chef: Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts.
Principal Victoria: And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.
Principal Victoria: He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.
Chef: Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', "I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"
Ms. Choksondik: And, nobody has found him?
Mr. Mackey: Well, we really haven't ll-looked.
Principal Victoria: But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.
Chef, Victoria, Mackey: NOOO!!
Brunette: Oh my God, Oh my God!
Nerd #1: Uh, well, it's a simple hydrogen-fusion core with a veltig reactant-
Nerd #2: Which just turned into a time bomb.
Timmy: Please help.
Nerd #2: Yah... wait, you mean 73 episodes.
Nerd #1: ...No, there were 72.
Nerd #2: No there weren't!
Hansen: It's alright, everything's goin' tuh be fine.
Brunette: Oh my God!
Kenny: (Yes, sir!)
Hansen: No no, that's only if the boy gets off.
Pilot: Ten seconds, Hansen!
Stan: ...nine, eight...
Pilot: ...six, five...
Mr. Garrison: Who-? Who are you? What do you want?
Ms. Choksondik: Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope!
Mr. Garrison: Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?
Ms. Choksondik: Choksondik.
Ms. Choksondik: Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children!
Mr. Garrison: ...Two hundred bucks.
Ms. Choksondik: ...Done.
Stan: Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
Nerd #1: Huh? Oh... Can't.
Kyle: What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one!
Nerd #1: I can't, because pizza-face isn't here! We're not on speaking terms! We got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out!
Stan: W-what did you get in a fight about?
Nerd #1: There's 73 original Star Treks! He keeps saying there's 72!
Stan: Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
Nerd #1: No! He actually thinks there's 72.!
Cartman: Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
Kyle: Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
Timmy: Timmah! Timmaaaaahhh!
Mr. Garrison: Alright, let's try it again.
Ms. Choksondik: "Children, we are now going to do math problems."
Mr. Garrison: "But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems."
Ms. Choksondik: "Don't use that kind of language, young man!"
Mr. Garrison: Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, "Suck my balls," you say, "Present them."
Ms. Choksondik: Oh.
Ms. Choksondik: Pre-sent them?
Ms. Choksondik: I'm ready. I'm not afraid.
Stan: God-damnit, this is ridiculous.
Nerd #2: Look! There aren't 73 episodes of Star Trek, there are 72! "The Menagerie" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! Pizza-face is wrong!
Cartman: Who the hell cares?!
Nerd #2: I know! Why does he have to be such a dick about it?!
Kyle: Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
Nerd #2: No, because he's WRONG!
Kyle: Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
Cartman: God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!
Stan: I know.
Mr. Garrison: This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
Ms. Choksondik: What lives inside?
Mr. Garrison: Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.
Unkempt Garrison: My gay side, uh- I DON'T HAVE A GAY SIDE!!!
Unkempt Garrison: You aren't real! You can't be!
Clean Garrison: It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay self, incarnate.
Unkempt Garrison: What do you want?
Clean Garrison: I want you to not fight me anymore. To accept me, once and for all.
Unkempt Garrison: Why?
Unkempt Garrison: But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am!
Clean Garrison: Oh, stop it! What about the time you looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in the men's locker room?!
Unkempt Garrison: I was just comparing size!
Clean Garrison: For seven minutes?!
Clean Garrison: And what about the time you masturbated to the men's 100-meter swimming relay at the Olympics?!
Unkempt Garrison: I was beating off to the chicks!
Clean Garrison: THERE WERE NO CHICKS!
Unkempt Garrison: OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER!
Clean Garrison: ADMIT IT!
Unkempt Garrison: NO!!!
Clean Garrison: YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING TO YOURSELF AND GET A G-
Cartman: Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
Ms. Choksondik: Children, I will have order!!
Nerd #1: I can't wait for Gene Roddenberry to tell you how WRONG you are! Just like when you said there were no two-parters of Battlestar Galactica!
Nerd #2: There WEREN'T!
Nerd #1: The episode called "Gonzo on Ice Planet Zero" was a two-parter.
Nerd #2: No it WASN'T!
Stan: Oh, son of a bitch!
Ms. Choksondik: Children, get back into your seats!
Cartman: No way, lady!
Ms. Choksondik: Eric, I mean it!
Cartman: You can suck my balls!
Cartman: ...What?
Ms. Choksondik: You said, "suck my balls." Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em.
Cartman: Touch, teacher. Touch.
Stan: Dude. Sh-she's right.
Kyle: Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
Stan: Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
Cartman: What??
Kyle: Hey, Timmy's back!
Stan: Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
Principal Victoria: Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Mackey: What?
Mr. Garrison: I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!
Mr. Mackey: Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself!
Principal Victoria: Well, congratulations!
Mr. Mackey: Yeah, congratulations!
Mr. Garrison: You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!
Stan: Dude, what's your little brother doing here?
Kyle: Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
Stan: But isn't he only three years old?
Kyle: Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.
Ike: I pooped my pants.
Stan: Cool!
Stan: Wow, cool!
Kyle: Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
Cartman: Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
Kyle: He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
Cartman: He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
Ike: I pooped my pants!
Kyle: He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
Stan: Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
Ms. Crabtree: Sit down and shut up!!
Stan: But they smell like pee.
Kyle: You are?
Man: Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.
Stan: Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
Cartman: Yeah, that's me.
Cartman: Yeahhh, you already know about it?
Bill: Yes. Yes, I do.
Kyle: I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
Stan: Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
Kyle: No, I don't! I don't care!
Boy #1: Hey, there he is. That's the kid that's s'posed to be some kind of genius.
Boy #2: Yeah, he's only three and he's already in kindergarten.
Boy #1*: Come on. [The two boys walk up to Ike and sit on the chairs on either side of him] So, you think you're smarter than the rest of us? Do you think you know more about the world just because you are only 3 and we're 5?
Ike: Unkoo baba.
Filmore*: Here.
Mr. Garrison: Sally Bands?
Sally: Here.
Mr. Garrison: Ike Broflovski?
Ike: Cookie Monster.
Trapper Keeper: [its TV screen turns on] Trapper Keeper active.
Cartman: Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
Trapper Keeper: Ready for hybrid. [Two cables reach out and grab the calculator and pull it into a ready slot. Cartman closes the Trapper Keeper]
Cartman: And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
Kids: Wow.
Kyle: Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
Kyle: I'm gonna!
Kyle: I will!
Boy #2: I nominate Filmore, because he's the smartest kid in the class.
Jenny: I gotta go doodie.
Mr. Garrison: Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about you?
Mr. Garrison: ...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids.
Stan: Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
Cartman: I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
Bil: Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!
Cartman: Okay, that's cool.
Bil: Got it!
Cartman: Ey!
Mr. Garrison: Flora, you have to pick one. Filmore or Ike?
Flora: Um, I vote for... I don't know.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer.
Flora: Okay.
Boy #: Flora, just say you vote for Filmore so we can all go home.
Flora: Um...
Sally: No! You want Ike to be president.
Filmore: We're gonna be here all night! Why don't you guys just concede?
Two kids: Yeah!
Sally: Why don't you just concede?
Some Kids: Filmore!
Other Kids: Ike!
Mr. Garrison: Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!
Cartman: Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
Barbrady: Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.
Kyle: Whoa, dude..!
Cartman: Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
Bill: Please. You do not understand.
Stan: Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
Barbrady: Bill Cosby?
Barbrady: Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!
Stan: Wow, that's amazing.
Kyle: Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
Stan: What do you think, Officer Barbrady?
Barbrady: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Stan: Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
Cartman: What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
Stan: Yes!
Flora: I decided.
Flora: Umm... Ike.
Supporters: Yay!
Filmore: We want a recount.
Filmore's Supporters: Recount! Recount! Recount! Recount!
Filmore: Count them again.
Supporters: Yeah!
Kid #2: Wait, there's still that absent kid.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, will you grow up?!
BSM-471: Good morning, humans.
Stan/Kyle: Hey, Bill Cosby.
BSM-471: I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada.
Kyle: That should do it.
Stan: So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
BSM-471: Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right.
Stan: Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
Cartman: Why the hell not?!
Stan: Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
BSM-471: We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper.
Kyle: Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
Stan: Cartman!
Kyle: Hey! What are you doing?
Kyle: Oh... Okay.
BSM-471: What?
Stan: Can I do it?
Stan: Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
Kyle: Yeah, that'd be faster.
Stan: He's right there.
BSM-471: I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually starting to feel what you humons call "compassion". It is an amazing feeling!
Stan/Kyle/ Kenny: Awww..!
Sally: Wait one minute!
Mr. Garrison: Oh, Jesus tap-dancing Christ.
Sally: I think the ballot were misleading. Some kids didn't understand whom they were voting for.
Mr. Garrison: There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?
Filmore: Well, just you wait, 'cause my famous aunt is on huh way right now.
Mr. Garrison: Who's your famous aunt?
Filmore: My aunt Rosie, Rosie O'Donnell.
Mr. Garrison: Your aunt Rosie O'Donnell is coming here?
Filmore: Yeah, she's very active in politics. So she's gonna set all this straight.
Trapper Keeper: Recharging.
Trapper Keeper: Trapper Keeper ready to ensorb. [cables reach out and grab Cartman's computer like a giant hand, and pull it towards the Trapper Keeper]
Cartman: Oh, cool.
Trapper Keeper: Trapper Keeper, merging. [cables reach out and grab a lamp and a Wellington Bear desk clock]
BSM-471: And so you see, Ms. Cartman, you cannot buy your son Eric another Trapper Keeper. Not now! Not ever!
Liane: Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness.
BSM-471: Correct.
BSM-471: Good. Now all that is left to do is destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has now. Where is he?
Stan: Uh-oh.
Kyle: Here we go again.
Trapper Keeper: Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb.
Trapper Keeper: Trapper Keeper, ready for hybrid.
Kyle: Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!
Stan: Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Rosie O'Donnell: Hello, kids!
Filmore: Aunt Rosie!
Filmore: That's my aunt, Rosie O'Donnell.
Mr. Garrison: Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well.
Rosie O'Donnell: Don't worry, kids. Everything's gonna be fine. What's the problem?
Filmore: Aunt Rosie. We think I won class president.
Ike Supporter: No, Ike won.
Mr. Garrison: Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--
Trapper Keeper: [now with Cartman's voice] We are Trapper Keeper.
BSM-471: It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers!
Guard 2: Hey, Mark, look.
Stan: Cartman, you have to stop!
Trapper Keeper: We are Trapper Keeper. We are one.
BSM-471: That must be what Trapper Keeper is using for ventilation. If one of you could get in there, you could reach the CPU.
Stan: One-two-three, not it!
Kyle: I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
Cartman: I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
Kyle: Screw you, fat ass!
Cartman: Hey, screw you.
Cartman: Agh--! [four metallic arms from all directions reach out to trap him, then six more organic ones come in to secure him]
Kyle: No!
Rosie O'Donnell: We're just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew don't get cheated.
Mr. Garrison: Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse.
BSM-471: It is infusing with everything. It is already too powerful to stop!
Stan: Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
Kyle: I can't reach the CPU.
Rosie: What are you doin'?! Get out of my way!
Guard 2: Oh, no! Now there's two of those things!
Guard 2: Huh? Which one? I-It's just like I'm seeing double.
Trapper Keeper: Eeww.
BSM-471: Look! I think that infusing with Rosie O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick.
Trapper Keeper: Oohh... Bad pie... Bad pie... [begins to deflate and wither. Its appendages wither and begin to drop off as it darkens]
Stan: This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
Kyle: Got 'em!
Stan: He did it!
Jesse Jackson: Is this the kindergarten classroom?
Mr. Garrison: Jesse Jackson?
Jesse Jackson: That's right! I believe the African-American in your class were misrepresented!
Mr. Garrison: Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--
Mr. Garrison: You... yuh, you what?
Filmore: I don't wanna play anymore, 'cause this game is stupid.
Sally: Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.
Filmore: Ike, you could be class president.
Ike: I pooped my pants!
Stan: Huh, that's a bitch.
Cartman: Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
Stan: Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
Cartman: Awww, man...
Stan: Cartman!
Wendy: Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay?
Kyle: I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.
Wendy: Oh no! NO!
Stan: 'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
Wendy: My poor little Helen.
Wendy: She can't see or hear us, John.
Timmy: Heh-aaaah, Timmih!
Stan: 'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
Kyle: Can we take a lunch break now?
Cartman: No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
Stan: Uh-eally? Uh you think so?
Timmy: Agh oh-ight, Timmih!
Cartman: God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
Kyle: What is it, Butters?
Clyd: Oh, no!
Clyde: Oh, now what?
Stan: Oh yeah, we can't!
Cartman: Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
Clyde: Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?
Wendy: I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey.
Token: Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks.
Kids: Yeah
Cartman: That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
Kyle: Okay!
Kids: Yay!
Rancher: What kind of turkey are you lookin' for?
Kyle: A smart one, that can do tricks.
Timmy: Haaaaa!
Kyle: Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
Timmy: TIMMAY!
Rancher: Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head.
Kyle: What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!
Timmy: T-TIIMMAY TIMMAY!
Kyle: Alright, we'll take him. How much?
Rancher: Fifty bucks.
Kyle: But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
Rancher: I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot.
Rancher: I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too.
Kyle: Aw, blow it out your ass!
Wendy: Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?
Kids: Hooray!
Jeffrey Maynard: Now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. Something that sets up the entire show.
Kyle: Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
Cartman: You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"
?????: He's not gonna work, Kyle. The whole point was to make our play better than the kindergartners.
Token: Yeah, that turkey sucks.
Stan: You do?
Cartman: Cool! Can you get it for us?
Jeffrey Maynard: I will go promptly and call her trainer. On the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey.
Liane: Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.
Cartman: I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
Liane: Now, hon!
Clyde: Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
Cartman: Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
Cartman: Yeh.
Others: Wow.
Cartman: Whoa.
Bebe: Her feathers are beautiful.
Clyd: That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw.
Lamond: What... is... that?!
Clyde: Yeah, and it's from Broadway.
Cartman: No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
Kyle: Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
Cartman: No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
Lamond: My turkey does not work with other turkeys!
Cartman: Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
Lamond: She's not coming out. She's very upset! She's pooped all over the room!
Cartman: I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
Cartman: I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
Lamond: Well, it could meet with "an unfortunate accident."
Stan: Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Cartman: Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
Butters: The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!
Wendy: Oh, no!
Token: But what are we gonna do?
Lamond: You see, they don't allow children in your... situation... to have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They... have to take it away.
Timmy: Gobbles!
Installer: Eh, excuse me, we're here to install the water effects for the musical?
Lamond: Uh, the stage is right through there.
Jeffrey: Well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing.
Cartman: Like what?
Cartman: Hey, that's not a bad idea.
Cartman: Oh, man!
Jeffrey: Well, did you see anything?
Cartman: No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
Jeffrey: ...Oh, that's too bad.
Boy: Daddy, why did Mommy leave and go to heaven?
Father: She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had no choice.
Man: Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry.
Sharon: Hi, Sheila.
Sheila: Hello, Sharon. Where's your husband?
Sharon: Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance.
Gerald: Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.
Randy: Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.
Gerald: Good idea.
Kyle: So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
Kyle: You ready for the big show, Timmy?
Stan: Where's Gobbles, Timmy?
Timmy: Gobbles.
Kyle: Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?
Mr. Garrison: Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant.
Sheila: This is "The Miracle Worker"?
Principal Victoria: Oh, oh, haha. Wow.
Wendy: She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen!
Stan: Helen!
Installer: Look, we're only here to do the water effects. We're not in charge of electrical. That's a different union.
Lamond: Oh, heh. Look, Tim, all is well in love and theatre, right? Haha.
Cartma: Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
Kyle: He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
Cartman: Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
Cartman: ...Alright, fine! Get in costume!
Timmy: Gobbles! Gobbles!
Wendy: There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.
Cartman: What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
Jimbo: Gotcha!
Jeffrey: Wawa.
Bebe: She did it!
Timmy: Aaaa, Timmih!
Timmy: Gobbles!
Mr. Garrison: And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, "Thanksgiving, Mon Ami."
Cartman: That's it?
Stan: We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
Butters: ...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
Timmy: Gobbles, deh!
Ex-Convict: Wha' are you doin' 'ere, you little whippersham!
Ex-Convict: Wha' are you doin' wit' those?
Mrs. Joe: A lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while I'm starvin' to death! Why don't you make us some bloody food to eat!
Mrs. Joe: Shut up, you silly lip! What are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper?
Pip: Where?
Mrs. Joe: "Havisham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter. Will pay up to..." TWENTY QUID A DAY??
Pip: ...I've come to answer the want ad.
Girl: Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!
Pip: Eho. After you, miss.
Girl: I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine!
Pip: I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.
Pip: Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.
Ms. Havisham: Estella, play with this boy.
Estella: ...Alright, boy, let us play.
Pip: Righty-o. What are we going to play?
Ms. Havisham: What do you think of her?
Pip: Well, uh... I think she's very pretty.
Ms. Havisham: Hm-m-m. What else?
Pip: I think she's rather insulting.
Dream Estella: Stop dreaming about me, you slow-witted rectal belch!
A British Person: Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk. But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew.
Pip: Oho. Well, yes, miss.
Estella: And, do you still think I'm insulting?
Estella: I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus!
Pip: Who is that?
Pip: Oh I... rather thought I was.
Ms. Havisham: Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces.
Joe: Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?
Pip: Joe, do you know anything about girls?
Pip: Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?
Lawyer: Joe, the blacksmith?
Joe: The same.
Lawyer: I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip.
Pip: I'm Pip, sir.
Joe: Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir.
Joe: Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but-
Lawyer: He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman.
Lawyer: There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous.
Lawyer: OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood?
Pip: Yes sir.
Joe: I am, sir.
Pip: Good-bye, sir.
Lawyer: You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this?
Pip: None, sir.
Pip: Mr. Pocket?
Pip: Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar
Pip: My, how lovely.
Pocket: Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!
Pip: Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed.
Pocket: That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad!
Pip: Well, what do you mean?
Pip: Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?
Pip: Oh. Excuse me.
Pocket: Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding.
Pip: At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.
Pocket: But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table.
Pip: Terribly sorry, Pocket.
A British Person: And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havisham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella.
Ms. Havisham: Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?
Ms. Havisham: Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it.
Pip: Righto.
Ms. Havisham: Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved.
Pip: Yes, but... where will I find her?
A British Person: Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world.
Pip: Hello, Estella.
Pip: Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.
Estella: Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith?
Pip: Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.
Pip: Because I believe I'm in love with you.
Estella: Pip, you must know that I have no heart.
Pip: I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind.
Pip: Who...? Who is that?
Estella: That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car.
Pip: I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?
Estella: I should. He's my boyfriend.
Estella: What's the matter, Pip?!
Pip: I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!
Pip: Ms. Havisham! But um...
Ms. Havisham: Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe.
Steve: Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?
Pip: But why do you make your daughter hurt people?
Steve: What the hell??
Joe: That's right. You're safe and warm now.
Pip: Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.
Ex-Convict: Yes. After you helped me I moved to Wales and made somethin' o' myself. If it weren't for you, I'd have never become a millionaire.
Joe: 'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!
Pip: You? But why?
Ex-Convict: Because back then you treated me like any other person. You're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man.
Pocket: I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman, who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex.
Pocket: Righto. Pip. Righto.
Pip: And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.
Joe: What's that, Pip.
Pip: If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!
A British Person: And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, in which the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havisham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations!
Ms. Havisham: Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle?
Pip: Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch.
Ms. Havisham: Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin.
Man In Middle: We were all Estella's boyfriends at one time or another. Now we're doomed.
Pip: You won't get away with this!
Robot Monkey: AAAAAAA!!!
Pocket: Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havisham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid.
Man: How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!
Ms. Havisham: ...Yes...
Estella: I told you, Pip. I have no heart.
Man In Middle: Ice-skating!
Pocket: Please, sirs, you must not cry!
Pocket: Philip, it's too late!!
Pip: Twenty-six baby bunnies
Estella: I don't want to. I don't see the point in this.
Pip: What?
Estella: I don't want to kill any more of them.
Joe: Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?
Estella: Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over.
Pip: You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!
Ms. Choksondik: Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism.
Bebe, New Kid: Woohoo.
Wendy: Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?
Butters: Hey! Ours is still alive!
Kenny: (Nuh uh!)
Kyle: Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
Stan: Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
Phillip: Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso.
Terrance: I don't see anything.
Terrance: I still don't see anything, Phillip.
Phillip: Waitwait. Hunh.
Cartman: I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
Terrance: AAHahahahahahaaa!
Liane: Eh yes, sweetie.
Cartman: God, I have to everything around here!
Liane: Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a "talk" with you.
Mr. Mackey: Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?
Dr. Doctor: We believe that you might have a problem.
Mr. Garrison: It's called intervention, Eric.
Liane: Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
Cartman: Fat camp?
Dr. Doctor: Yes, fat camp.
Mr. Mackey: Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you.
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.
Ms. Choksondik: And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-
Kyle: Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
Kenny: (I'm not eatin' that!)
Kyle: I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
Stan: I'll throw in five.
Ms. Choksondik: Oh dear.
Butters: I'll throw in a dollar!
Bebe: I've got three.
Kyle: Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
Male Counselor: Howdy there. I'm one of the weight counselors here. This must be Eric Cartman.
Liane: Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.
Rick: Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!
Cartman: No.
Taller Boy: Right.
Rick: Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat!
Rick: I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?
Taller Boy: Heh! It was a lady in a costume!
Kids: Eewww.
Stan: Well, at least you got it out of your system.
Kenny: (WHAT?!)
Kyle: I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
Butters: Huh-I'm in for five!
Stan: Oh, you guys!
Clyde: I've got three.
Token: Six!
Kids around Kenny: AAAAA!
Kids around Timmy: Waugh.
Kyle: Kick ass, dude!
Kyle: Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
Brunet Boy: I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You want some?
Cartman: Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
Driver: Can I interest you in some ice cream?
Boy 1: They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us.
Rick: Hey kids!
Susan: Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.
Rick: Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave.
Rick: So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT
Gerald: That's what being young is all about.
Liane: Thanks for coming, everybody.
Mr. Mackey: Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at havin' trouble at his weight-management camp?
Stan: We knew he wouldn't make it.
New Cartman: Hey, dudes!
Stan: I don't believe it.
Mr. Mackey: Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?!
Principal Victoria: Congratulations. How do you feel?
New Cartman: I feel awesome!
Kyle: What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
Liane: I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
Kyle: Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
Stan: Did you like the old one?
Kyle: Good point.
New Cartman: No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works.
Man 1: Do it again!
Man 2: Do it again!
Man 3: Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon!
Jesus: So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?
Stan: We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
Jesus: I can't say I approve of this, my children.
Jesus: Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.
Man 4: I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone else's vomit.
Man 5: Yeah!
Man 6: Yeah! Go for it!
Kyle: I don't know.
Stan, Kyle, Kenny: Hey, Chef:
Stan: Chef, what's a prostitute?
Stan: Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?
Stan: Chef, what's a prostitute?
Chef: Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.
Chef: Oh my God. Eric?
New Cartman: That's me.
Stan: Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
Chef: Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!
Stan: Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
Kenny: (Yeah. Am I?)
Chef: Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.
Kyle: Why?
Chef: Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services.
Stan: Like what?
Chef: Like keeping you company. Understand?
Stan: No.
Cartman: Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
New Cartman: Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you.
Cartman: Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!
New Cartman: Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut.
Cartman: What?!
New Cartman: I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids!
Cartman: Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
New Cartman: Twenty.
Student 1: Oh, gro-hoss
Student 3: Sick!
Kenny: (Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)
Announcer: Whoa-ho ho! You heard him, folks! Kenny is going to give a sensual full-body massage to his own grandfather!
Man 1: Oho! Yeah!
Man 2: Woohoo!
Audience: Awww! Awgh!
Stan: Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
Stan: Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
New Cartman: Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home?
Rick: I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight.
Susan: We'll just have to give them more time. They'll do it!
Rick: They'll do it.
Tom Green: Hey, Howard.
Howard Stern: Krazy Kenny is here to promote his Pay-Per-View special this week, where he will crawl up into a bus driver's uterus and stay there for six hours.
Howard Stern: Now, some people that all you guys do is perform sick and disgusting acts for shock value and money, which makes you whores. But I'd like to prove them wrong. So what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna offer each of you $50,000 to give me oral sex right now.
Tom Green: I'm in.
Johnny Knoxville: Me too.
Kenny: (And me!)
Howard Stern: Oh.
Tom Green: Fine! I'll do it for 40!
Johnny Knoxville: 30.
Kenny: (...Ten bucks!)
Howard Stern: Ooh, the kid says he'll do it for ten bucks.
Tom Green: Damnit. I'm out.
Howard Stern: Alright, let's get going, then. Can we cut the cameras?
Mr. Sanders: No! I have had it!
Rick: What's happening?
Susan: Horace's parents want to take him home.
Rick: Oh! But he's not ready yet.
Susan: Please, sir, if you give us one more week,...
Mr. Sanders: Your time is up!
Mrs. Sanders: Yeah, your time is up!
Horace: But, Dad, I...
Susan: We're in trouble, Rick.
Kyle: Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?
Ms. Crabtree: HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE?
Kyle: Six hours.
Ms. Crabtree: HELL, I'LL DO SIX HOURS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS YOU'RE PAYING ME!
Kyle: Great.
Kyle: For what?
Stan: For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
Butters: Who-what's a hummer??
Stan: I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
Kyle: Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
New Cartman: Uh oh.
Ms. Crabtree: I feel great! I haven't had this much attention paid to my coot since I was 16!
Announcer: Well, let's bring out the man of the hour, you know him as the-
Kyle: Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.
Kyle: Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!
New Kenny: But this isn't fair!
New Kenny: (But I'm gonna starve to death if I get in there!)
Rick: Good-bye, Chad.
Chad's Dad: We'll be wanting our refund, naturally.
Rick: Naturally.
Susan: Good-bye, Alice.
Alice: Good-bye. Thank you.
Rick: Oh, don't thank us. We failed you.
Horace: No, he's right. The counselors've been doing a good job. We've just been cheating.
Other campers: Yeah.
Horace: I believe I can lose the weight with exercise and proper diet. I don't wanna make excuses no more.
Girl: Me neither.
Horace: If you take us back, we promise we won't cheat.
Rick: Well, it's alright with me. Parents?
Susan: Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here anymore.
Campers: Yeah.
Cartman: What?!
Audience: Four, three, two, one!
Audience: OOOOHHHHHH!
Dr. Doctor: He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.
Ms. Crabtree: I told you I was a tight virgin flower.
Kyle: Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
Kyle: Come on. Throw the football, Ike.
Kyle: Hepatitis B?
Cartman: No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
Kyle: ...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
Stan: We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
Kyle: Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?
Sheila: No, Kyle.
Sheila: Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.
Kyle: But Mom, I-
Gerald: The answer is no, Kyle!
Kyle: My parents said I can't go.
Cartman: Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Kyle: ...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!
Kyle: What's Cuba?
Gerald: A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
Kyle: And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
Sheila: The whole thing.
Castro: Llamen a todos junto!!
Sheila: No you can't!
Gerald: Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.
Kyle: But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!
Sheila: We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.
Kyle: But that's not fair! You lied to me!
Gerald: Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-
Kyle: What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
Gerald: Because we're your parents!
Sheila: Kyle!
Kyle: It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
Stan: Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
Kyle: They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
Kyle: How?!
Cartman: Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
Stan: The police?
Cartman: Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
Kyle: What's that?
Cartman: I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
Kenny: (Wow, that is awesome!)
Stan: But what do the police do to them?
Kyle: Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
Kyle: What's "bad touch"?
Cartman: Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch."
Kyle: Okay, molestered, bad touch.
Sheila: Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that.
Case Worker: Oh, now you care?! They're going to live with their grandmother.
Kyle: Cool, thanks.
Stan: Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
Cartman: Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
Kids: Yeah, uh huh, woo hoo!
TV Announcer: The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.
Stan: What's going on?
Kyle: ...Nothing.
Kyle: Not one adult left?
Woman: Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are.
Man: I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on?
Man: Maybe you're reading the map wrong.
Woman: What's the matter with it?
Butters: Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?
Man: ...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car.
Butters: Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?
Man: ...It's... just you here?
Butters: No, uh Craig's here, too.
Man: Oh, good.
Man: Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?
Butters: Huuuhhhh, no.
Man: Fine! Can you take us there?
Craig: You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?
Woman: Yes.
Butters: Uhh rrreeally are you sure?
Man: Yes.
Man: Well, can you help us find the phone, please?
Craig: Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.
Woman: Why not?!
Man: Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games.
Craig: Craig.
Man: What?
Linda: Mark, I don't like this.
Mark: No, uh, it's lemon juice.
Linda: Oh God! Are you blind?!
Mark: No, it just really, really, really hurts!
Jenny: We wanna play.
Filmore: We already played with our parents.
Mark: What the hell is gong on here?!
Mark: Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!
Craig: I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
Mark: The mayor! Good! Finally!
Linda: You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
Mark: No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
Cartman: Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!
Linda: Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?
Cartman: Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.
Mark: No phones, either? How do you communicate?
Mark: I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!
Francis: SpitBall!
Linda: Mark, are we doing the right thing?
Mark: Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!
Linda: I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
Linda: The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here.
Kindergartners: Nah nah nanah nah!
Linda: Mark!
Mark: Why are you doing this?
Mark: Who?
Kyle: The fatass. The mayor.
Linda: Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?
Kyle: Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
Linda: But what about before that?
Stan: You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
Linda: Yes!!
Stan: If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
Mark: I'll do anything to get to a phone!
Stan: Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
Kids: The Before time.
Boy: The story of the before time.
Kids: Yuck, yuck, yuck.
Kids: Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Kids: Provider. Provider.
Kids: Boo!
Boy: Bwack bwack!
Kids: Coosh!
Kids: Carousel, Carousel.
Stan: We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
Mark: Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?
Stan: Yes. No foolies.
Kids: No foolies.
Mark: I know, but this will all be over soon.
Sheila: Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!
Gerald: Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?
Sheila: Oh, it's awful! Just awful.
Randy: Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.
Gerald: Eh, neither did we.
Mrs. McCormick: We didn't, either.
Gerald: Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!
Mr. Evans: Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!
Gerald: I don't have any urges!
Butters: I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.
Cartman: Where is your husband?
Linda: Uh, uh...
Mark: Now, can I please have the cell phone?
Cartman: Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!
Butters: Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
Cartman: Butters, calm down, alright?
Mrs. McCormick: Make a sweater?
Blond Man: Oh. Fishing?
Linda: Mmrrhhhh!
Cartman: Heh, heheh.
Linda: Rrrmm-mmrrhh!
Mark: Give him the book back.
Cartman: We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!
Cartman: The Provider awakes!
Stan: It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
Butters: Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!
Mark: Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!
Linda: Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.
Cartman: Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.
Mark: Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!
Kyle: Parents. Mom. Dad.
Butters: Oh boy, here it comes!
Stan: He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
Kyle: Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
Mark: Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
Butters: Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
Linda: Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
Stan: Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
Kyle: Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
Stan: Hey, you guys came back!
Kyle: Did you make it to your job interview?
Mark: Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
Linda: And I got my tubes tied.
Kids: Alright!
Kyle: Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
Kids: Yeah.
Kyle: Mom! Dad!
Parents: ...Come here, come here.
Kyle: Yeah. We're fine.
Gerald: Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.
Kyle: But you didn't do anything to me.
Gerald: Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.
Stephen Stotch: We love you, son, but we only love you in a platonic way from now on.
Butters: Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?
Stan: Huh.
Kyle: Huh.
Kyle: He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.
Kyle: Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
Kyle: Go away!
Stan: Ho-o-oh.
Kyle: Okay, good. You're all here.
Stan: What is this all about, Kyle?
Kyle: It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
Kyle: It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
Cartman: Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
Kyle: If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
Cartman: Heh-tchoo!
Cartman: Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
Kyle: ...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
Mr. Hankey: Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle.
Kyle: But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
Cartman: Family?
Mr. Hankey: Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn.
Mr. Hankey: They're too young to drink, honey.
Autumn: Hey haa, it's Christmas!
Mr. Hankey: Our daughter Amber.
Mr. Hankey: And our son, Simon.
Simon: Eee, hey! Hnhn.
Siimon: Heh What? Dad? Huh?
Mr. Hankey: Nothin', Simon.
Kyle: A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
Mr. Hankey: It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.
Stan: I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
Cartman: Anything for more presents!
Autumn: "Hic" Weh-hell, it's a Christmas party! Hey! You boys! You boys wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes?
Mr. Hankey: Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay?
Woman: Ew, I almost stepped in it.
Man 2: Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls.
News Anchor: Well, the holiday spirit may be gone from South Park, but at least our faith in each other remains strong.
News Anchor: Oh really?
Charlie Brown: Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree for our play.
Cartman: Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.
Stan: How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
Kyle: Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
Cartman: Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
Cartman: My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
Stan: What, dude?
Stan: We don't know anything about animation.
Cartman: Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!
Kenny: (Yeah, right! Awesome!)
Aide 2: Mayor, some adorable children are here to see you.
Mayor: Meugh. Send them in.
Mayor: You do?
Kyle: We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
Stan: It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
The Boys: Awww.
Mayor: But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.
The Boys: Alright!
The Nuggets: Okay!
Amber: What's the matter, Cornwallis?
Kyle: Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.
The boys: Whoa!
Cartman: What?!
Kyle: God job, Butters.
Butters: Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
Mr. Hankey: Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in.
Cornwallis: I don't want to, Dad. I'm too sad.
Cornwallis: It's not that, father. Its... Well, I don't feel like I'm really a part of Christmas.
Autumn: God-damnit it's Christmas and we're gonna be a happy family around the tree!
Mr. Hankey: Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up.
Mr. Hankey: ...Now come on, son. Don't be so down.
Cornwallis: Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas isn't for us.
Mr. Hankey: Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!
Cornwallis: I see the Nativity. There's angels, shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All the Christmas movies: Santa, elves, reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of it.
Cornwallis: I'm nothing but crap!
Cornwallis: But how can I be that giraffe and blade of grass, and a human? I don't control what they do.
Stan: Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
Kyle: What's a hard p?
Cartman: You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?
Kyle: Oh, yeah.
Sound man: Hold on.
Cartman: ...deh..OOOWW!!!
Stan: Hey! Wait a minute!
Kyle: What?
Stan: Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
Kyle: Well, yes, I think so.
Kyle: Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
Stan: What's awesome?
Sound man: The script. It's sweet.
Kyle: Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
Stan: Easy.
Kyle: Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
Stan: Kickass!
Kyle: Now, the next mouth.
Kyle: Okay, where are the E-mouths?
Kyle: Okay. "Woo" mouths again?
Kyle: So how much done is that?
Stan: "We wish you a m- Merry"
Johnson: This... place is pretty run-down.
Mayor: It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming.
Mr. Hankey: My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.
Mr. Hankey: They're not real, you know.
Mr. Hankey: Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn!
Mr. Hankey: Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work.
Cornwallis: We can fix it up, Dad.
Stan: AAAAAAAA!
Kyle: Cartman!
Cartman: Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!
Stan: That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
Stan: We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
Kyle: We'll dub his voice over.
Kyle: You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?
Stan: "Awgh! I'm so fat!"
Kyle: Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.
Sound Man: Rolling...
Kyle: Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
Kyle: Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
Cartman: What are you talkin' about, "quit"? Huh! I don't remember that.
Kyle: Okay, Mr. Hankey!
Stan: Hey! Wait a minute!
Kyle: What?
Stan: Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
Kyle: Yeah, I think so.
Kyle: What?
Stan: You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
Man: Oh, that's Christmas for ya.
Mayor: Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties.
Man 2: Boring.
Man 3: I've gotta go.
Man 4: Stupid.
Kyle: All that hard work.
Mayor: Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!
Kyle: But we spent it!
Kyle: All that work!
Stan: For nothing.
Mr. Hankey: Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry.
Kyle: Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.
Mr. Hankey: It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.
Cornwallis: But Dad, we can fix the projector.
Mr. Hankey: Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap.
Cornwallis: Dad, you taught me an important lesson: That crap is the cycle of everything.
Mr. Hankey: Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'
Cornwallis: No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because you showed me that I have the power and the strength to do anything I want. You made me believe in myself, Dad! Now I'm asking you to do the same.
Sharon: Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family.
Kyle: What the--
Jesus: You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle!
Santa: I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.
Jesus: Christmas is for celebrating my birth!
Santa: Christmas is for giving!
Crowd: Oh, wow!
Amber: Mom! They got it working!
Stan: Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu. Christmas still is about one very important thing.
Cartman: Yeah, ham.
Cartman: Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
Kyle: Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.
Stan: ...Christmas is about something much more important!
Kyle: What?
Stan: Don't you see, Kyle?
Kyle: Yeah.
Stan: Presents.
Various Folk: ...Presents.
Man 5: My God, they're right!
Mayor: They're starting to understand, Johnson.
Ms. Choksondik: We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive.
Kyle: You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
Mr. Hankey: No, you did it, boys!
Mayor: Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?
Stan: Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
Cartman: Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
Stan: Wow! Count me in!
Cartman: Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
Stan: What?
Stan and Kenny: [pause] ...Oh.
Kyle: Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
Stan: Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
Kyle: What, doughboy?
Stan: So?
Kyle: What?
Cartman: No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
Kyle: What?!
Cartman: You'll never guess.
Stan: What?!
Cartman: Guess.
Stan: They can't say "shit" on television!
Cartman: It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.
Stan: Holy fucking shit!
Kenny: (Dude! We've gotta watch!)
Cartman: Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
Cartman: Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television!
Kyle: It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
Stan: Aw, come, on dude! This is history.
Kyle: It's stupid!
Cartman: Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
Kyle: No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
Randy: Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?
Sam: Yeah, they're gonna say "shit" on television.
Sam: Yeah.
Randy: Yeah.
Colleague 2: Are you guys gonna let your kids watch?
Sam: And they're gonna say "shit"!
Kyle: How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
Mr. Garrison: Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes.
Mitchell: I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped!
Jimbo: Oh, was that it? Was that it?!
Frank: I told you, we don't have a record of that. And besides, -
Frank: - your job is to protect the men who serve this force.
Cartman: Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?!
Stan: Sh!
Mitchell: Maybe... maybe protect them from you?
Frank: Maybe you're forgetting who you're talking to!
Mitchell: And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too!
Frank: Yeah? You used to be a lot of things.
Sheila: Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?
Mitchell: That's it, I've had enough of this.
Frank: Don't you turn your back on me, you!
Mitchell: I said, enough!
Frank: Is it?
Frank: Will it... ever be enough?
Stan: Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"
Cartman: I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
Stan: Where are you going, Kyle?
Stan: But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!
Stan: Oh.
Mitchell: Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop.
Frank: Well, Mitchell. I guess you're goin'ta do what you're gonna do. Let's just try and stay friends no matter what.
Mitchell: You're right. Maybe I'll see you around.
Mitchell: Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks.
Bar Patrons: Wow!!!
The Boys: Whoa!!!
Chef and Principal Victoria: Oh!!
Old Folks: Whoa!
Cartman: Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!
Cartman: Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
Cartman: Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.
Tom: Whoa, shit!
Ms. Choksondik: Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, "shit".
Stan: Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!
Kyle: This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
Ms. Choksondik: Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form.
Cartman: I don't get it.
Stan: Me neither.
Ms. Choksondik: Very good, Timmy.
Ms. Choksondik: Yes, that's now fine.
Cartman: Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
Cartman: Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
Kyle: There's no sand in my vagina!!!
Mr. Garrison: And so, children, instead of saying "Hand in your papers," I may now say, "Hand in your shit." Any questions?
Filmore: What about, "I have to take a shit"?
Mr. Garrison: No! No, Filmore! You can say "I have to poop and shit," or "Oh, shit, I have to poop," but not "I have to shit." Are we all clear?
Kindergartners: No.
Randy: Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.
Stan: It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Stuart: Well, now, that's part of the fun.
Randy: Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
Cartman: That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
Timmy: Hyeah Timmay!
Cartman: Yeah, he's excited.
Butters: Hey, fellas!
Butters: Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
Randy: Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.
Stuart: You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
Stan: Hey, it's Big Gay Al!
Big Gay Al: Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list!
Timmy: Timmay!
Randy: You're the new scout leader?
Stan: See ya, Dad!
Timmy: Ji- Jimmay?
Stuart: Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!
Randy: He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
Stephen: Well how gay is he?
Stuart: He's really, really gay.
Randy: So he's a homosexual. So what?
Stuart: I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??
Randy: Aw, that's ridiculous.
Jimmy: How about Jimmy Stewart? "Merry Christmas, movie house." And John Travolta. "Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!"
Stan: Jimmy's funny, dude.
Butters: Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!
Stuart: Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock.
Randy: Come on, Stanley.
Cartman: Hey, yeah!
Jimmy: Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas.
Stan: Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.
Kenny: (Yeah, see ya.)
Stan, Cartman: Bye, Jimmy.
Jimmy: See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas.
Stan: You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Stan: We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
Cartman: Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.
Stan: And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!
Cartman: Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
Timmy: Ah.
Stuart: Uh huh!
Randy: You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!
Stan: Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-
Randy: Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!
Randy: That's better.
Cartman: Hehe, I don't sound like that.
Man: Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my
Head Scoutmaster: Well, this is it. We've simply gotten too many complaints from concerned parents about him. I'm afraid we don't have a choice.
Head Scoutmaster: How are you today, Scout?
Big Gay Al: I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event. Yippie!
Head Scoutmaster: Uh, Big Gay Al, it's recently come to our attention that you are... gay.
Big Gay Al: Well, stop the presses. Did you figure that out all by yourselves, silly buns?
Scoutmaster 1: Yes, well, unfortunately for you, the Scouts have a policy that openly gay men cannot belong.
Head Scoutmaster: We are left with no options, Mr. Al. I'm afraid you are hereby... out of Scouts.
Head Scoutmaster: We're sorry, Mr. Gay Al.
Big Gay Al: But I've been in Scouts since I was nine - it's a... huge part of my life.
Scoutmaster 2: Uh, you must understand that Scouts is a private club. A club that follows certain beliefs, and one of those beliefs is that homosexuality is immoral.
Big Gay Al: I see...
Head Scoutmaster: It's nothing against you personally
Scoutmaster 2: We think it's best you just... move on.
Jimmy: Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet.
Jimmy: What's that?
Jimmy: A present? You got me a p-present?
Timmy: Timmih!
Marc: [starts playing sprightly music] Ooooh, I don't want her. You can have her. She's too fat for me.
Head Scoutmaster: Parents, this is the new Scout leader, Mr. Grazier. He will be taking over for the homosexual.
Randy: Nice to meet you.
Mr. Grazier: Marsh, right? We actually kind of know each other. Your wife and mine are friends.
Stuart: Your wife, huh?
Head Scoutmaster: Carol is the head of a girls' Mountain Scouts troop.
Mr. Grazier: Gonna go pound some brews, huh?
Cartman: Awww!
Scouts: Yes, Scoutmaster!
Scouts: Awww.
Mr. Grazier: Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! "We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!"
Mr. Grazier: Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts!
Randy: Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape.
Stuart: Yeah. Now they're acting like men.
Mr. Grazier: Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside.
Randy: You bet.
Stuart: I heard that.
Butters: Oh, well, here he is.
Stan: Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!
Cartman: Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
Big Gay Al: I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts.
Stan: Kicked out? Oh no!
Big Gay Al: Really? wull-why?
Big Gay Al: Why not?
Stan: Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.
Big Gay Al: Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals.
Jimmy: Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much.
Stan: What do we want?
Boys: Gays in Scouts!
Stan: When do we want it?
Timmy: Timmih!
Stan: What do we want?
Boys: Gays in Scouts!
Stan: When do we want it?
Timmy: Timmih!
Stan: What do we want?
Boys: Gays in Scouts!
Stan: When do we want it?
Timmy: Timmih!
Stan: What do we want?
Boys: Gays in Scouts!
Stan: When do we want it?
Little Girl: Puppies. Puppies for sale.
Butters: Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?
Timmy: Timmih!
Jimmy: Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!
Timmy: Timmay!
Jimmy: Put on the hat!
Jimmy: Pu-put it on!!
Jimmy: Not this year.
Timmy: Timmih, Timmih.
Cartman: Cripple fight!
Timmy: Haaa.
Jimmy: Come on. Come on!
Timmy: Timmih.
Jimmy: Come on!
Susan: Oh my God!
Timmy: Hahnah Timmih.
Timmy: Hahnah Timmih.
Timmy: Timmih!
Timmy: Lah-livin' a lie!
Reporter: Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice.
Farmer: Those boys have shown me the light. I never knew the Mountain Scouts was a hate group.
Randy: Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off.
Reporter: The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred.
Reporter: With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you.
Stuart: Kenny?
Randy: Oh my God.
Tom: Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here.
Man 6: Alright, boys, break it up.
Bailiff: All rise.
Randy: Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.
Chief Justice: And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast!
Stan: We did it! We did it!
Crowd members: What's he saying?
Stan: Huh?
Man: Uh, Hooray!
Another Man: Hooray, hey!
Stan: So wait, did we do good?
Butters: Uh yeah, ah I think so.
Cartman: Eh, we kick ass.
Timmy: Timmih.
Timmy: Tim-mih.
Jimmy: Yes?
Head Scoutmaster: You know our policy: I'm afraid you're... out of Scouts.
Stan: Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.
Butters: Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?
Carol: No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of hearts.
Blaine: Four of hearts? Really? Look again.
Woman: Whoa
Kyle: That's pretty cool, dude!
Kyle: He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
Cartman: Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
Jimbo: Kern.
Blaine: Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think about a card. Pick any card, and picture it in your mind.
Jimbo: Huh??
Blaine: Go on, reach up your ass.
Blaine: Deeper.
Blaine: Was that the card you picked?
Kyle: Wow, that's cool!
Stan: How'd he do that??
Crowd: Whoa!!!
Stan: No way!
Kyle: Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
Kyle: "David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.
Cartman: Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!
Speaker: Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and I've been a Blaintologist for about three years. So, when David Blaine performed his miracles out on the street, what moved you the most?
Stan: His a-miracles?
Steven: Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader.
Cartman: When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
Stan: Yeah!
Steven: Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?
Butters: I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
Steven: ...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-
Butters: And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
Steven: Your potential hasn't even been reached.
Cartman: Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
Steven: That's right.
Cartman: Cool.
Ike: No-oo.
Sheila: That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!
Kyle: We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
Sheila: Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.
Kyle: So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
Barber: Prepare to be cleansed and release the magic inside you.
Recruits: Wow!
Butters: Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.
Stan: No, I'm Stan.
Stan: Who are you?
Kyle: I'm Kyle.
Stan: Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.
Stan: Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
Kyle: But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow.
Aide: Where are you going?
Stan: I'm going home.
Aide: You don't want to go home.
Stan: You said we're free to leave whenever we want
Aide: You are.
Stan: Move out of the way.
Stan: I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.
Aide: Why don't we go into the back room for a second, and talk? Then you can leave.
Kyle: What are we doing?
Stan: We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
Kyle: Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.
Stan: Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!
Stan: A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
Kyle: Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
Kyle: I'm not going anywhere!
Stan: Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
Kyle: Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
Stan: Oh wait, who am I again?
Kyle: You're Stan.
Kyle: Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
Elderly Woman: Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic.
Cartman: Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
Kyle: That's right.
Elderly Woman: So you're not a cult?
Elderly Woman: Well, alright, come on in.
Kyle: ...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
Cartman: Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?
Elderly Woman: No, not really.
Cartman: Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
Cartman: He's going to eat his own head.
Kyle: How many tickets can we put you down for?
Elderly Woman: Oh, I can't go.
Cartman: Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
Cartman: No you're not.
Elderly Woman: Yes I am.
Cartman: No you're not.
Elderly Woman: I really am.
Cartman: No you're not.
Elderly Woman: But I am.
Cartman: No you're not.
Elderly Woman: Alright, two tickets
Kyle: Great!
Kyle: That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
Cartman: Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
Stan: Hi, Jesus. It's me.
Stan, Jesus: Stan Marsh.
Jesus: Of course. I know you, my child. Come in.
Stan: This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
Jesus: You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.
Stan: I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.
Jesus: The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.
Stan: Can you do it again?
Stan: That's it? That's how you did that trick?
Jesus: Wuh well, yeah.
Stan: That trick sucks, Jesus.
Jesus: Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago.
Stan: Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.
Jesus: Then let's go.
Stan: But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.
Kyle: This is a really good turnout.
Blaine: Hello, my children.
Crowd: Wow!
Blaine: Your magic is old and outdated, Jesus! Twah. Just like you are.
Blaine: The old religions have failed you! Twah. What have they offered except for war, poverty, and sadness? Blaintology offers you the key to living your life to the fullest! Will you join us?
Crowd: Yes!!
Jesus: His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it.
Stan: Then what are we going to do.
Stan: Super best friends?
Jesus: Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before.
Buddha: I'll call everyone together. Come as fast as you can.
Jesus: Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long.
Stan: To where?
Jesus: Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes.
Jesus: Are you still keeping your eyes closed?
Stan: Yeah.
Jesus: Good. Want some peanuts?
Kyle: Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
Kyle: Mass suicide?
Steven: Mr. Blaine has said that by killing ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife!
Steven: Get your things ready. We leave for Washington at dawn!
Mohammad: Jesus, we've been working hard since we got your distress call!
Loa Tse: Who the kid?
Stan: So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?
Mohammad: More than friends, young boy, we are super best friends, with the desire to fight for justice.
Stan: Wow.
Seaman: Stop it!
Kyle: It's just me.
Kyle: Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
Cartman: What?
Kyle: I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
Kyle: I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
Cartman: I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
Kyle: What have you done, Cartman?!
Cartman: This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.
Blaine: You must understand, brother Kyle, twah, you know too much about the Church. If you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause.
Cartman: Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
Cartman: At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
Joseph Smith: Look at that, Jesus. His followers are growing at a rate even faster than mine! It appears this David Blaine is as dangerous as you and your young friend had feared.
Stan: I knew it.
Jesus: Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night.
Mohammad: Moses, scan this tape. Can you tell us the source of Blaine's power?
Stan: Wow, the Moses.
Moses: His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand. Wait a minute: I'm picking up movement from Blaintologists from all over the country.
Lao Tse: The Blaintologists are heading to Washington. But why?
Jesus: Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status.
Joseph Smith: Omigod!
Lao Tse: What?
Joseph Smith: If he gets tax-exempt status, then he'll become a real religion.
Krishna: He would become unstoppable
Narrator: Meanwhile, in the nation's capital, Blaintologists from all over the country have gathered to commit mass suicide!
Narrator: Meanwhile, at the White House...
Kyle: Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
Kyle: Cartman, no!
Blaine: Give us what we want or we will continue to die
Jesus: Not so fast, David Blaine!
Blaine: Jesus! Not again.
Buddha: Buddha!
Mohammad: Mohammad!
Joseph Smith: Joseph Smith!
Krishna: Krishna!
Lao Tse: Lao Tse!
Seaman: Sea-Man!
Stan: Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Jesus: That takes care of them.
Joseph Smith: Now it's your turn, Blaine!
Buddha: Oh this looks like trouble.
Kyle: Stan!
Stan: Kyle, you can't kill yourself!
Mohammad: It is too powerful, Jesus!
Narrator: Meanwhile, at the Super Best Friends League...
Jesus: Come in, Moses!
Moses: What?
Jesus: We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.
Moses: ...Um... Let me think, um... a giant stone John Wilkes Booth?
Mohammad: Krishna, we're going to need wood for a mold!
Narrator: Using the wood that Krishna cut down as a beaver, Jesus uses his master carpentry skills to make a giant mold.
Jesus: That should do the trick. Now for some concrete.
Narrator: Meanwhile, in the ocean depths, Seaman seeks out water to mix with the concrete.
Cartman: Hey, I was just about to do it.
Narrator: Later, at exactly the same location...
Jesus: Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine!
Buddha: It's alright. Everything is as it should be.
Jesus: Oh, shut up, Buddha!
Blaintologist: Don't leave us, David Blaine!
Stan: Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.
Narrator: And so, Jesus and his companions leave Washington. But their return is assured, for there will always be a need for... the Super Best Friends!
Stan: What's no big deal?
Cartman: Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
Kyle: ...What the hell are you talking about?!
Kenny: (You got pubes??)
Kyle: What's "pubes"?
Stan: Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
Cartman: Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
Cartman: You wanna see 'em?
Cartman: My pubes.
Stan: What??
Cartman: I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
Kyle: Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
Stan: Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
Cartman: Uh oo what?
Cartman: Nuh uh!
Kyle: Yuh huh!
Cartman: You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
Kyle: Yeah.
Cartman: Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
Scott: Uh uh, I don't take returns!
Cartman: Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
Scott: You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!
Cartman: Just give me back my money...
Scott: Buyer beware, dude!
Cartman: Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
Cartman: Whoa, bummer, dude.
The Boys: Yay!
Phillip: Excuse me, buddy.
Stan: Oh man, this is another rerun.
Cartman: Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
Kyle: Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
Phillip: I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?
Phillip: Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?
Phillip: Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?
Stan: Because I had an itch up my ass.
Terrance: Terrance & Phillip will be right back...
Stan: When are they gonna make new ones?
Stan: What's this?
Kyle: Oh my God!
Stan: Enough! I know!
Kyle: Write the number down! Write the number down!!
Stan: Dude! Did you get 'em?
Kyle: I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
Butters: Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?
Stan: Yep. Tomorrow night.
Class: Oohh.
Older man: Hello children, I know you're all very excited about having the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival put on in your town.
Class: Yes.
Kyle: What??
Younger man: We've all gotta pitch in.
Stan: Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
Cartman, Kyle, Kenny: Yeah.
Older man: You... what??
Kyle: Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
Older man: And Terrance and Phillip are more important than Mother Earth?
Cartman: Well yeah, dude.
Stan: No, dude, we really, really do.
Ms. Choksondik: I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day.
Stan: Huh?
Kyle: See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
The Boys: All right!
Kyle: Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.
Stan: Yeah, he looks terrible.
Terrance: How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh. [Terrance farts and the audience claps awkwardly] Hey, do you all remember this one? "Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass." "Reallih? Let me take a look." "Look closer." [farts, and laughs]
Stan: Uuuuhh.
Cartman: Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
Cartman, Kyle: Phil-lip!
Audience: Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip!
Phillip Stand-in: Hello Terrance.
Terrance: Hello Phillip.
Stan: Phillip? That's not Phillip.
Terrance: Say, Phillip, I have a question for you.
Kyle: Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
Cartman: I think this new guy's funny.
Phillip Stand-in: Excuse me, sir. Do you know Who farted?
Terrance: He sure did.
Phillip Stand-in: What's the person's name?
Terrance: Who.
Phillip Stand-in: The guy that farted!
Terrance: Who!
Phillip Stand-in: The person that passed gas!
Terrance: Who passed gas!
Phillip Stand-in: Now, why are you asking me?
Terrance: That's the man's name?
Phillip Stand-in: That's Who's name?
Terrance: Yes!
Phillip Stand-in: Something very terrible has happened in the world of Terrance and Phillip, and we've got to find out what.
Phillip Stand-in: Look, buddy, all I'm trying to find out is What's the guy's name that farted?
Terrance: Right, the guy that drank his own urine.
Phillip Stand-in: Who?
Bouncer: Where do you think you're going?
Kyle: We have to talk to Terrance.
Bouncer: Hyeah, right.
Stan: It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
Cartman: Aw, dude, gay!
Stan: You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
Stan: Man, this sucks!
Cartman: Don't talk to us, kid.
Stan: I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
Groupie: It was so great meeting you. I feel like we really shared something.
Terrance: You're a huge fan alright!
Obese Woman: Can I just have you sign my breasts?
Terrance: But what do I get in return?
Obese Woman: Oh, Terrance, I love you.
Terrance: Yeah.
Obese Woman: I LOVE you!
Terrance: Ah good.
Obese Woman: I LOVE YOU!!
Terrance: Yeah-
Terrance: Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?
Stan: We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.
Kyle: Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
Terrance: Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?
Stan: But where's Phillip?
Kyle: Phillip, your partner.
Kyle: But the guy who replaced him sucks!
Stan: Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.
Stan: What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
Kenny: (Toronto?)
Clyde: Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming.
Stan: Oh no, dude.
Kyle: Uuuh, we didn't get them.
Stan: They're not together anymore, dude.
Younger man: You'd better be joking. We've already announced their participation.
Kyle: Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
Older man: You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else!
Stan: But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
Kyle: Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
Cartman: Weak.
King Claudius: Part them; they are incensed.
Osric: How is't, Laertes?
Laertes: Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
Hamlet: How does the queen?
Hamlet: O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.
All: Treason! treason!
King Claudius: O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
Hamlet: Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother.
Horatio: Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left, buddih.
Horatio: Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest, buddih!...
Phillip: Yes?
Stan: Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
Phillip: Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.
Phillip: AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!
Stan: But we need you!
Cartman: Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
Phillip: Yeah, whatever, kid.
Stan: He'll do it, dude.
Kyle: Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
Phillip: What?
The other boys: What?
Phillip: Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?
Stan: Two thousand dollars.
Stan: Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
Kyle: I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
Cartman: Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
Kyle: They said they'd come.
Stan: I'm sure they'll be here any minute.
Kenny: (AAAAHH!)
Stan: Oh my God!
Older man: Oh. Very good. Mr. Phillip, I am Jack Farliss, head of the Earth Day Committee. Thank you for being part of this important event.
Terrance: Alright, I'm here. Where do I-?
Kyle: Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
Stan: Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.
Phillip: So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?!
Terrance: My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.
Phillip: Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!
Terrance: Ditto!
Jack: Alright, we'll come off the speech about the dying whales, and thennn, action!
Terrance: Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass.
Phillip: Really? Let me take a look.
Phillip: Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-
Phillip: You're right. It's a better one, asshole!
Phillip: Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!
Phillip: That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!
Kyle: You can't leave! The show starts soon!
Kenny: (OOOWWW!)
Kyle: You bastards!
Crowd: Wow!
Kyle: Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month.
Terrance & Phillip: Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
Woman: Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!
Man: It's alright, darling, they're just Canadian.
Woman: Oooh.
Terrance & Phillip: Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
Sonny: You know, Cher, a lot of us real Americans don't know much about Canada.
Phillip: Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war.
Kyle: Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
Cartman: Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
Kyle: I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
Stan: Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.
Kenny: (Aahhh!)
Phillip: Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?
Terrance: I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas.
Mr. Mackey: Sh. We're watching "Behind the Blow," m'kay.
Stan: Come on, Kenny, hurry up!
Phillip: Terrance...
Terrance: Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too.
Phillip: I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before.
Terrance: We sure did.
Terrance: Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you.
Stan: They're back!
Cartman: Alright!
Jack: Yes! Earth Day is saved, boys! Everything worked out after all!
Stan: It sure did.
Kenny: (Oh, well now that's sweet.)
Terrance: He sure did, Phillip.
Narrator: And so, Terrance and Phillip got back together, proving once and for all that fame and fortune are never as important as friendship.
Cartman: Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
Liane: Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over.
Cartman: Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
Cartman: Great. Now can we go?
Liane: No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.
Cartman: Ogh! God-damnit..!
Liane: In a minute, sweetie. This is important.
Executor: "To my loving son, Stinky: I leave you the house in Nebraska. Look after it as your father and I did."
Cartman: Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...
Executor: "To my grandson Eric: You are always my favorite fat little man, my perfect round little pudding-piler."
Executor: "For you, Eric, I leave from my life savings, the sum of one million dollars, to be transferred to you immediately."
Liane: A million dollars?
Executor: "Eric is the primary benefactor of my estate, since it is likely the rest of you would spend the money on crack."
Liane: Oh my.
Uncle Stinky: That can't be!
Cartman: Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
Executor: Yes, Eric, it's yours.
Executor: And now, you do.
Kyle: "No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"
Stan: Yeah, awesome!
Kenny: panting(You guys! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
Stan: ...Why?
Kenny: (Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)
Kyle: Nuh uh.
Kenny: (No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)
Banker: Nine hundred ninety nine thousand four hundred, nine hundred ninety nine thousand five hundred...
Jimbo: Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash.
Ned: Mm-me neither.
Mr. Garrison: Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?
Cartman: I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
Jimbo: On what?
Cartman: Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.
Priest Maxi: Eric, God could sure use that money for a bigger church.
Cartman: Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
Kyle: What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Stan: Oh my God.
Cartman: Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
Stan: Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
Kyle: Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
Cartman: Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
Kyle: No... No, this isn't possible.
Stan: Yeah, it's unbelievable.
Kyle: No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
Kyle: Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
Liane: Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?
Cartman: My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.
Mr. Fun: I can't do it.
Broker: What?
Cartman: What?!
Broker: Frank...
Cartman: Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
Mr. Fun: You... you're not?
Cartman: Gentlemen, I thank you.
Stan: Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
Stan: Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
Stan: What's that?
Kyle: So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
Stan: Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
Kyle: Hunh, I guess you're right.
Kyle: Where are we going?
Kyle: Hohohooho! Oowwww!
Stan: Come on, dude!
Kyle: Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
Stan: Aw, crap.
Stan: Alright, let's go.
Stan: You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
Kyle: My life can't get any worse!
Cartman: ...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!
Security Guard: So what does does this job pay?
Cartman: Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.
Security Guard: Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides.
Security Guard: I'm not interested.
Cartman: Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.
Security Guard: If you need security, I need a cash salary.
Cartman: Ugh... Two people?
Security Guard: This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park.
Cartman: Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...
Security Guard: I will shoot on sight.
Cartman: Sweet.
Gerald: Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you.
Stan: Dude, are you okay?
Kyle: Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
Stan: Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.
Sheila: Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.
Stan: Jesus.
Kyle: But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
Sheila: Kyle, don't say such things!
Kyle: Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
Gerald: Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--
Kids: Aw.
Boy: That's gay.
Cartman: I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
Butters: Hoh.
Cartman: The rest of you will just have to try another day.
Butters: We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
Clyde: Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
Cartman: Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.
Security Guard: Uh, I'm security, not maintenance.
Cartman: But I don't know how it works.
Security Guard: Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person.
Cartman: Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
Timmy: Timmay!
Cartman: HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!
Stan: Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!
Cartman: I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
Stan: It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
Gerald: Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?
Sheila: Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.
Kyle: I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
Sheila: But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.
Sheila: Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."
Gerald: But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."
Sheila: To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."
Sheila: Basically.
Kyle: That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
Gerald: Oh. Uhhh, I don't know.
Kyle: Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
Clerk: Welcome to Cartmanland.
Sheila: Isn't he getting any better, doctor?
Host 2: And the way he did it is with the brilliant "You Can't Come" technique. For the first several days, the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park. It made the public crazy. So then, weeks later, when he opened the doors, they were lining up around the block. Simply amazing.
Host 1: Well, ahah I think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country.
Waitress: I'm sorry, we're no longer taking reservations. Nobody can eat here. You'll have to leave now.
Host 1: Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time.
Mr. Fun: My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around!
Chris: He sure did!
Mr. Fun: Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success.
Cartman: Just give me my money back.
Mr. Fun: What?
Cartman: I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
Mr. Fun: ...But it's doing great!
Cartman: You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
Gerald: Isn't he responding at all, doctor?
Sheila: But then... are you saying...?
Doctor: There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live.
Agent: Excuse me? Eric Cartman?
Cartman: He-hey, that's my money!
Cartman: What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
Cartman: Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!
Mr. Garrett: We know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.
Mr. Fun: Nohoho way, Jos!
Cartman: But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!
Cartman: This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
Stan: Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?
Doctor: Well, I s-supposed it could be rigged, but I--
Stan: Then damnit man, do it!
Security Guard: Move along, sir! You are vandalizing private property!
Stan: Kyle!
Doctor: He's coming back.
Sheila: That's it, baby. That's it.
Cartman: Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!
Doctor: Wait a minute. Yes! The hemorrhoid is going into remission!
Stan: "Scream for me, bitch!"
Stan, Kyle: Whoa! Awesome!
Stan: Oh no, what now?
Kyle: What's this all about, Kenny?
Kenny: (Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
Stan: Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Cartman: I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
Kyle: No they don't!
Kenny: (Yeah they do!)
Kyle: That's awesome!
Cartman: I told you guys.
Stan: I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
Kyle: You "beat off?"
Stan: Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
Sharon: I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-
Sharon: Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?
Stan: But it's super-cool!
Man: Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry.
Stan: Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.
Sharon: Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!
Stan: My room? Why?
Stan: No!
Stan: Why?! What's the big deal?!
Sharon: Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??
Stan: I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.
Randy: No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.
Stan: Huh??
Sharon: You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!
Stan: What things??
Sharon: Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet?
Stan: No!
Principal Victoria: Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time.
Principal Victoria: School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.
Mr. Tweek: It isn't soon enough.
Chef: Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.
Ms. Choksondik: Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex.
Chef: The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.
Adults: Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to.
Stan: Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?
Ms. Choksondik: Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it.
Bebe: Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!
Girls: Yeah!
Wendy: I didn't mean that-
Girls: AAAHHH!
Ms. Choksondik: And here's a little syphilis for you!
Girls: AAAHHH!
Ms. Choksondik: That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms!
Chef: Hello there, children.
Boys: Hey Chef.
Chef: How is sexual education class going?
Stan: It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
Kyle: Yeah... Chef, what's "laid"?
Chef: ...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.
Stan: You guys, we just wanna know-
Girls: AAAAHHH!
Wendy: Stay away from me, Stan!
Stan: Why?
Wendy: Are you wearing a condom?
Stan: ...A what?
Girls: AAAAHHH!
Bebe: Do any of you have your condoms on?
Kyle: No.
Girls: AAAAHHH!
Wendy: Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
Kyle: Nuh uh.
Bebe: Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS.
Cartman: AIDS?
Butters: Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
Kyle: Is that what you learned in sex ed?
Cartman: Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
Stan: Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.
Wendy: You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.
Kyle: Oh my God, dude.
Butters: Uh what are we gonna do, huh?
Stan: Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.
Pharmacist: Can I help you boys?
Stan: Yeah, we need condoms!
Kyle: Yeah. Quick!
Pharmacist: How old are you boys?
Butters: Ha-I'll be nine next week.
Pharmacist: Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms.
Kyle: Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
Pharmacist: I just don't think kids your age should be-
Mark: But... they're... children!
Assistant: Would you rather them do it unprotected?
Cartman: Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!
Mark: I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!
Assistant: Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected.
Stan: Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.
Mark: I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!
Assistant: Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty.
Butters: Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?
Assistant: No, you have to change it.
Mr. Mackey: Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik.
Ms. Choksondik: Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway.
Mr. Mackey: Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... "missed" anything.
Mr. Mackey: Right! Oral sex, which of course would be...
Mr. Mackey: Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay.
Ms. Choksondik: It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.
Mr. Mackey: Yeah, why d-uh, did you?
Ms. Choksondik: Did I what?
Mr. Mackey: Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
Ms. Choksondik: People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand.
Ms. Choksondik: Your nickname?
Mr. Mackey: "That guy with the really big head."
Ms. Choksondik: ...Right.
Mr. Mackey: Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm.
Ms. Choksondik: Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me.
Mr. Mackey: Neither have I.
Ms. Choksondik: Well, back to the lesson plan, then.
Stan: Doesn't it give any other directions?
Kyle: Uh, what are "studzes"
Cartman: Just put it on, Butters.
Butters: Ha-a how come I gotta go first?
Cartman: Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?
Kyle: It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
Stan: Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!
Cartman: I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
Kyle: Sure.
Stan: How do you feel?
Butters: ...Pretty good.
Cartman: Do you feel protected?
Butters: Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
Timmy: Timmehah!
Principal Victoria: Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use.
Ms. Choksondik: I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade.
Principal Victoria: But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?
Ms. Choksondik: ...Kindergarten.
Chef: Kindergarten?!
Ms. Choksondik: We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after.
Chef: Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!
Mr. Adler: I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.
Principal Victoria: I guess we have no choice.
Jenny: It flies around and it's endangered.
Filmore: Can we do fingerpaint?
Girl: Eeww.
Narrator: That's right.
Stan: Man, this condom's driving me crazy.
Kyle: Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
Cartman: I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
Mr. Mackey: Why are you wearing a condom?
Cartman: So I don't get AIDS.
Mr. Mackey: Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex.
Stan: From sex??
Mr. Mackey: Yes.
Kyle: You mean, intercourse with a girl?
Mr. Mackey: Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye.
Cartman: I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
Mr. Mackey: Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
Kyle: Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
Mr. Mackey: And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m'kay.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?
Girl: Doggie?
Boy: Pile driver?
Flora: The Filthy Sanchez?
Boy 2: Hot Karl?
Bebe: Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!
Cartman: Here, talk to them, Butters.
Cartman: Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
Cartman: Oh, bitch!
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.
Mr. Mackey: It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay.
Mr. Mackey: And these... are the two areas most important to-
Ms. Choksondik: Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?
Mr. Mackey: I go crazy.
Ms. Choksondik: Do you touch yourself?
Mr. Mackey: G'oh, m'kay.
Ms. Choksondik: Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!
Mr. Mackey: Huh, what's wrong?
Mr. Mackey: Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. Okay! Okay!
Mr. Mackey: I do.
Ms. Choksondik: Tell me.
Ms. Choksondik: Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?
Mr. Mackey: Well. No.
Sharon: What the hell was that?
Ms. Choksondik: Did you feel something?
Chef: Oh, no!
Cartman: Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.
Stan: We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
Ms. Choksondik: I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first.
Kids: Oooohhh.
Chef: Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved.
Parents: Huh?
Ms. Choksondik: He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently.
Sharon: This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.
Sheila: It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject.
Principal Victoria: Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.
Kids: Hooray!
Stan: But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?
Chef: It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17.
Chef: Seventeen.
Sheila: So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?
Chef: Nope, just 17.
Gerald: But, what if you're not ready at 17?
Stan: Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
Wendy: Yeah. Thank God.
Mr. Garrison: Okay children, so what other sexual positions have we talked about? Yeah, the wrap-around butt grab. Sure, can't forget that. Uh huh, reverse cowgirl. Good, Kevin. Hot Lunch, sure, she likes that. Donkey Punch, uh huh. Glass-bottom boat. Good one, yes. Fish-eye. Good, Jenny. Chili dog. Mm-hm.
Kyle: HA! I killed you!
Stan: HA, I blew your head off!
Kenny: (Aw, Goddamnit!)
Stan: Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?
Kyle: Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
Cartman: Let a man take a crap!
Stan: Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.
Kyle: Hyeah, that poor, poor thing
Stan: Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!
Kyle: Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
Cartman: Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.
Stan: Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
Sharon: Eric, put that down!
Cartman: Why?
Sharon: Just go put it back in the trashcan!
Sharon: No that... that came from me; just put it away.
Kyle: Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?
Stan: The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
Sharon: Sure.
Kyle: Cool!
Cartman: Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
Kyle: Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
Stan: What's that?
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Stan: What?
Kyle: I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
Stan: Dude, we got GameSphere.
Stan: What?
Towelie: When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't forget to bring a towel."
Stan: ...O-kay.
Kyle: Thanks, Towelie.
Kyle: Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
Cartman: Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.
Boys: AAAAAA.
Kyle: Okay, turn it on.
TV: "Okama GameSphere"!
Boys: Whoa!
Cartman: Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
Kyle: Oh, this is so cool.
Sharon: Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late.
Stan: G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.
Randy: What?
Cartman: Date-rape psychosis.
Cartman: Awesome!
Stan: Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
Cartman: We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
Kyle: Uh no.
Towelie: When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."
Stan: Okay, we will.
Kyle: No we don't wanna get high!
Towelie: Okay... You sure?
Stan: Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
Cartman: That's... so... cool!
Sharon: Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.
Stan: No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
Sharon: No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.
Cartman: It's Monday?
Stan: Oh, uh, I'm sick.
Kyle: Me too.
Stan: But Mom...
Sharon: Go!
Boys: Aagh!
Stan: Can't believe we have to go to school!
Kyle: Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
Commander: Hello, boys, how are you?
Stan: Fine.
Commander: Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere.
Stan: That was the longest day of school ever!
Kyle: Where is it?
Stan: It... it was right here.
Kyle: Where the hell is it??
Stan: Hello?
Stan: What? Who-who is this?
Stan: They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
Kyle: Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
Stan: Towelie!
Cartman: Hey, towel!
Kyle: Where the hell is he?
Kenny: (I don't know. Where could it be?)
Stan: I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
Kyle: What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
Kyle: That's a towel call?
Stan: This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
Kyle: Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
Kyle: There he is!
Towelie: Where are we goin'?
Kyle: Just come on! It's getting dark.
Towelie: Are we gonna get high?
Kyle: Are you sure this is where they said to be?
Stan: They said the gas station outside of town.
Official: There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you.
Towelie: If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.
Official: It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you.
Stan: 'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
Official: Your what?
Kyle: Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
Official: I don't know what you're talking about.
Stan: Goddamnit, what now?!
Soldier 1: Where's the towel?!
Kyle: Aw, God-damnit!
Stan: Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?
Towelie: What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.
Commander: Well?
Soldier: They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air.
Commander: It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B.
Soldier 3: You mean...?
Kyle: Are we getting close?
Towelie: I think so.
Kyle: How long has it been since you've been back there.
Towelie: I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.
Cartman: No it isn't.
Towelie: Is!
Cartman: No it isn't.
Towelie: Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.
Cartman: Egh!
Towelie: M-maybe it's down that dirt road.
Stan: Alright, so where is it?
Towelie: Where's what?
Boys: Agh!
Towelie: Well calm down.
Towelie: That's my last joint, asshole!
Kyle: I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
Towelie: Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.
Soldier: Harris! Reach bang and clear!
Soldier: Get it!
Mr. Garrison: Huh where are you goin'?
Cartman: This is where you came from?
Stan: What?
Research Leader: Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400.
Stan: Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
Kyle: We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
Research Leader: Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth
Stan: We don't care.
Research Leader: You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly.
Stan: Dude, we don't care.
Research Leader: Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off.
Stan: We... don't... care.
Kyle: All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
Research Leader: Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop.
Kyle: Who's they?
Research Leader: Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction.
Research Leader: Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again.
Research Leader: I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at "their" base.
Stan: Can you tell us where "that" is, please?
Soldier: Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!
Sgt. Masters: Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.
Sgt. Boll: Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles.
Sgt. Masters: Oo we...
Sgt. Boll: He must have outsmarted us, sir.
Commander: Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!
Research Leader: In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.
Kyle: Okay.
Towelie: That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
Research Leader: Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you.
Stan: We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
Guard: Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?
Kyle: Dude, I figured it out.
Stan: What?
Kyle: If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
Stan: So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
Kyle: Seven and a half.
Stan: Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
Towelie: Hey it's been a long time!
Cartman: You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
Cartman: I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!
Cartman: Yeah, and you're a towel!
Kyle: That's it?
Stan: No, Towelie, the entry code!
Stan: God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
Towelie Clone: Kill... me... Kill... me.
Towelie: Oh my God! No-o-o-o!
Commander: Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid.
Towelie Clone: Kill... me.
Stan: Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
Commander: You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story.
Stan: Oh God, don't care, don't care.
Soldier: Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.
Kyle: What terrifying secret?
Commander: That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
Cartman: We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
Kyle: And we don't care.
Commander: You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down.
Stan: So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
Commander: Oh yes. It has been all along.
Soldier: Can I kill the towel now, sir?
Stan: But we don't care!
Official 1: What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!
Research Leader: The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.
Official 2: We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!
Stan: We're just going in to get our video game back.
Towelie: Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.
Research Leader: So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?
Research Leader: Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children.
Commander: Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.
Cartman: Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
Kyle: Sweet!
Stan: Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!
Zytar: Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.
Cartman: Could you turn it up?
Stan, Kyle: Whoa.
Cartman: Kenny!
Towelie: Get away from me, you evil towel!
GS-401: Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them.
Towelie: No way! They're my friends!
GS-401: They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now.
GS-401: You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high.
Towelie: You asshole.
Cartman: Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
GS-401: Come, Towelie! Make your decision!
Stan: Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
Kyle, Towelie: Alright!
Cartman: Hooray!
Stan: Oh, dude, we finished level 50!
Kyle: Awesome!
Towelie: Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
Kyle: Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
Stan: Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
Cartman: You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
Towelie: I know.
Kyle: ...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
Cartman: ...Not really.
Stan: Butters, what the hell are you doing?
Butters: Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
Stan: Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
Butters: Stop breathin'?
Kyle: Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
Cartman: Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.
Cartman: Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?
Officer Barbrady: I'll think of a way. Now move along!
Cartman: HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
Ms. Choksondik: Eric, the Afghan people need our help!
Wendy: We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!
Wendy: The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!
Cartman: Yes, but they're sand monkeys!
Afghan Kyle (named "Akmarh Shulur"): ( "Are they gonna be bombing us all day?"
Afghan Stan: . "The weather guy has said if it rains, it's gonna be OK in the afternoon."
Afghan Cartman: !! "Hey, I can't find anything to eat here!"
Afghan Boys: Awww!
Kyle: I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
Kyle: No. This is taking forever.
Kyle: What, Cartman?
Kyle: It isn't that funny, Cartman.
Cartman: ...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.
Kyle: But I never take off my hat.
Photographer: Come on now, I bet your parents want a picture of YOU lookin' natural.
Ms. Choksondik: Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today!
Cartman: Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?
Photographer: Should be about four days.
Cartman: Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!
Cartman: Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!
Ms. Choksondik: Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out-
Kenny: (Aww, that's bullshit!)
Butters: Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.
Ms. Choksondik: For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely.
Ms. Choksondik: Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters!
Cartman: Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!
Ms. Choksondik: You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters!
Cartman: I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
Butters: I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
Receptionist: Welcome to South Park Milk Company. Can I help you?
Receptionist: Oh, of course. Printing those photos on our milk really does help. Do you have the photo with you?
Receptionist: Okay, brown eye...
Receptionist: ...Full cheeks...
Kyle: Hello?
Kyle: Hello?
Stan: What's he want?
Kyle: Why'd you call us?
Kyle: ...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
Stan: That isn't funny, Cartman.
Kyle: No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
Cartman: No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.
Martha: Look. It's him! It's... our son.
Steven: Our ssson!
Steven: We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition.
Receptionist: ...Riiight.
Steven: You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
Steven: Yes.
Martha: Steven and I have a condition called "torsonic polarity syndrome." It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically.
Steven: Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS.
Steven: Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France.
Receptionist: So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?
Steven: No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages...
Receptionist: Well, Mr. and Mrs...
Steven: Uh, Thompssson.
Receptionist: ...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together.
Martha: Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again!
Steven: Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?
Martha: You're right. You're right.
Kyle: ...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
Stan: ...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
Kyle: ...Nuh uh.
Cartman: Oh God.
Stan: Oh boy.
Kyle: Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
Stan: Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
Receptionist: Well?
Steven: They said to inquire four houses down.
Kyle: Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Stan: Yeah, you missed them turning around.
Cartman: You guys, something's wrong.
Stan: What?
Cartman: I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
Clyde: You mean they both have butts instead of heads?
Stan: Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.
Token: How do they eat?
Kyle: Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
Kyle: You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
Stan: There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
Butters: Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
Stan: But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!
Butters: Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.
Linda: You made a goofy face!
Butters: No! That's just what I look like. See?
Butters: I'm not makin' a face, mom!
Linda: Stop it!
Craig: ...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.
Mr. Mackey: Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?
Cartman: Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?
Mr. Mackey: Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.
Cartman: Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
Cartman: You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... [Mr. Mackey is shocked by the last one] This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
Mr. Mackey: Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.
Cartman: Ugh.
Mrs. McCormick: ...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton.
Martha: Yes. Yes, I see.
Martha: ...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up.
Steven: It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be.
Stuart and Mrs. McCormick: Really?
Receptionist: Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?
Steven: Tommy disappeared when he was only seven.
Steven: Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time.
Martha: Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again.
Male 2: Come on, dude.
Male 1: Oh, alright Here it goes. Come'ere, Grandpa.
Audience: Aww
Cartman: Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
President: Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons.
Steven: Please, please. It's not your fault.
Martha: Amazing.
Steven: Delicious.
Steven: Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
Martha: Oh my, isn't this impressive?
President: Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases.
Steven: Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time.
Mrs. Garthunk: Alright then. Computer...
Computer: Workiiing.
Mrs. Garthunk: Run a scan of missing children since 1982. Check for physical birth defects called TPS.
Computer: TPS. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome. Child missing since 1982. Workiiing.
President: So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years?
Martha: That's right.
Mrs. Garthunk: But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now?
Mrs. Garthunk: It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids.
Steven: We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.
Jimmy: Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much.
Jimmy: What's this all about?
Cartman: Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.
Jimmy: Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.
Cartman: I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
Jimmy: Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.
Cartman: Okay, let me have it.
Jimmy: Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?
Cartman: Okay, why?
Cartman: ...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.
Jimmy: Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock.
Cartman: Who's there?
Jimmy: Orange.
Cartman: Orange who?
Jimmy: Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?
Jimmy: Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock.
Cartman: Who's there?
Jimmy: An interrupting ca'ow.
Cartman: An interrupting cow who
Mrs. Garthunk: Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer?
Computer: Workiiing.
Mrs. Garthunk: Scan for any children reported found in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a facial deformity.
Computer: Workiiing.
Mrs. Garthunk: Alright, then break it down to claims in the past twenty years.
Mrs. Garthunk: Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk.
Computer: In skim form, homogenized has longer shelf life by 2.3 weeks.
Mrs. Garthunk: Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S.
Computer: Torsonic Polarity Syndrome, plus, a claim to not know parents: one match
Mrs. Garthunk: Bingo. Do you have a photo
Mrs. Garthunk: My God. Oh my God!
Kyle: Butters! Hey Butters!
Kyle: They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
Butters: Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.
Stan: Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
Stephen: Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?
Stephen: Alright, you can take the paper bag off.
Stephen: Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!
Butters: Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-
Stephen: Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious!
Stephen: Put that bag back on!
Cartman: Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.
Cartman: And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
Ben Affleck: Mom! Dad!
Stan: Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!
Steven: Oh, our same ol' Ben!
President: Isn't this wonderful?
Kyle: Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
Kyle: Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
Cartman: A-heh, what?
Kyle: Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
Stan: Huh?
Kyle: When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
Stan: Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
Cartman: E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
Kyle: There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
Stan: Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
Kyle: Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
Stan: Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.
Security Guard: Uh I don't know nothin'.
Sheila: That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us.
Kyle: What's he look like?
Sheila: He's your age and about your height.
Ike: I todd a nurra.
Kyle Schwartz: Hello, Aunt Sheila.
Sheila: You remember Uncle Gerry.
Kyle Schwartz: Hi, Uncle Gerry.
Kyle: Hey dude.
Kyle Schwartz: It's nice to meet you.
Both Kyles: Okay:
Clerk: Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.
Mr. Garrison: I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!
Mr. Garrison: This is unbelievable! You know, I seem to remember when the airlines said, "We need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-"!
Clerk: Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left?
Man: Hey, he's right!
People: YEAH!
Clerk: Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?
People: YEAH!
People: YEAH! ALRIGHT! GO!
People: YEAH!
Kyle Two: Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it.
Kyle: Oh is, is this beef?
Kyle: Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
Sheila: Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?
Kyle: Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
Sheila: Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?
Kyle: We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
Kyle Two: Mom?
Sheila: Yes, Kyle Two?
Kyle Two: How am I related to him again?
Sheila: He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.
Kyle Two: Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin?
Sheila: He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.
Kyle Two: So we have the same blood?
Sheila: Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.
Kyle Two: What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?
Sheila: I'm sure your friends will love him.
Sheila: Kyle Two, he's your responsibility.
Kyle Two: Oh my God.
Sheila: I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.
Kyle: What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
Kyle Two: I don't know, dude.
Kyle: Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
Kyle Two: I don't think so.
Kyle: Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
Mr. Garrison: Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either!
Mr. Hat: What was wrong with that plan?
Mr. Hat: Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass around.
Enrique Iglesias: [on TV, gyrating his hips around, holding his crotch in his left hand, the back of his head with the right one] ...I think about you day and night. I think about you...
Mr. Garrison: Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say?
Mr. Hat: I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass!
Mr. Hat: Check out his hot bulge, too.
Stan: Hey dude.
Cartman: What's that thing?
Kyle Two: Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal.
Cartman: What?
Kyle Two: That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.
Cartman: Forty bucks?
Kyle Two: But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'.
Cartman: Alright, alright.
Kyle Two: And you especially can't say anything about Jews!
Cartman: Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
Kyle: I can't believe how cold it is out here.
Kyle: It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
Stan: What the hell was that?
Officer Barbrady: Uh what the hell was that?
Stuart: What the hell was that?
Stuart: Yep, me too.
Kyle: ...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
Kyle: Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
Ms. Choksondik: Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin.
Kyle Two: What?
Kyle: Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
Cartman: Ugh, ugh!
Kyle: Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
Cartman: Oh!
Ms. Choksondik: Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class.
Kyle Two: CARTMAN!
Kyle Two: You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, "Catch the Ball." I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me.
Kyle: Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
Kyle Two: It's fine!
Kyle: Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?
Kyle: Now what?
Kyle Two: Now throw it back to me.
Kyle: But it's down in the snow.
Kyle Two: ...So dig it out.
Kyle: But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
Kyle Two: ...Well, then we'll dry them off!
Cartman: Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
Kyle Two: You did, too! You are so full of crap!
Kyle Two: You blew the deal, Cartman!
Cartman: Goddamnit, give me another chance!
Kyle Two: Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you.
Kyle: Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
Kyle Two: Kyle, I-eh I'm sorry.
Kyle: Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
Kyle Two: What?
Kyle: Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
Kyle: Boy it sure is dry out here.
Mr. Garrison: Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports!
Mr. Hat: That sounds incredible, Mr. Garrison.
Guests: Whoa.
Steve Forbes: Nice.
Donald Trump: Sweet.
Mr. Garrison: IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour.
Guests: Whoa. Wow.
Bill Gates: This will change everything.
Steve Jobs: We're going to have to rethink cities!
Guests: Ugh. Oh.
Bill Gates: But the way it works... do you think people will go through that to travel?
Steve Forbes: Hey, it... still beats what you go through at the airports.
Guest 1: True.
Guest 2: Yup.
Guest 3: Yeah, that's true.
Guest 4: Yeap.
Kyle Two: I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane.
Stan: I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.
Kyle Two: Ya see?
Jeff Arrando: Tom, the day is finally here. IT has arrived for retail sale, and people are getting their first look at it.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch.
Randy: Oh, man, it that the IT?
Craig's Father: Hehyeah.
Stuart: How is it?
Kyle: I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
Kyle Two: Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn.
Kyle: It seems like I might get splinters, though.
Kyle Two: How far do you think it is to Connecticut?
Kyle: It's a least a couple of hours.
Kyle Two: Think he'll be alright?
Sheila: Kyle Two, where is Kyle?
Kyle Two: You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut.
Kyle Two: Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her.
Sheila: Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.
Kyle Two: AAA!
Kyle Two: A, a bus. R-really?
Kyle Two: Oh no- don't worry about it, dude.
Kyle: Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
Jimbo: Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT.
Jimbo: Uh, that's okay, I'll stand.
Randy: Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.
Mr. Garrison: Sure.
Mr. Garrison: Yeup.
Mr. Garrison: Right.
Randy: So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?
Man 1: Huh?
Man 2: Whazzat?
Man 3: Wha- what did you- what did he say?
Man 4: What?
Kyle: I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
Kyle Two: Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport.
Stan: Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
Security Guard: Daaah, sorry, but ever since that IT thing came out the airlines have had to cut back on employees.
Kyle Two: Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?!
Security Guard: Derr, let's see: Twelve people... plus... times... divided... two hours domestic, three hours international.
Kyle: Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
Kyle Two: No!
Security Guard: See, we do these checks for a reason!
Kyle: In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
Kyle Two: JUST GET IN THE BOX!
Kyle Two: I hope he doesn't suffocate.
Mr. Garrison: Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?
Agent 1: It's alright, we're with the government.
Agent 2: We're just shutting you down.
Mr. Garrison: Shutting me down? Why?
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down!
Agent 4: Right, so the government is bailing the airlines out again, by shutting you down and making ITs illegal.
Agent 5: Sir, many people work for the airlines. We can't let them all be fired.
Mr. Garrison: THE AIRLINE COMPANIES ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE AND THEIR OWN INEFFICIENCY!!
Sheila: Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?
Kyle Two: I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air.
Sheila: I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.
Kyle: I'm back.
Kyle: Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
Stan: So dude, did Cartman's idea work?
Kyle Two: No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home.
Stan: Damn!
Kyle Two: I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.
Kyle: Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.
Sheila: Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back.
Stan: Yeah, haha.
Kyle Two: Dudedudedude! You- you have five million dollars??
Kyle: Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
Stan, Cartman: Yeah!
Kyle: Re- really?
Kyle Two: Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?
Kyle: Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
Kyle Two: ... Uhwhat?
Kyle Two: Dude! Weak.
Ms. Choksondik: Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check.
Ms. Choksondik: NOW Eric!
Kyle: Haha!
Ms. Choksondik: You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus.
Cartman: Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!
Cartman: I'll make you eat your parents!
Ms. Choksondik: What did you say?!
Clyde: Wwooww.
Ms. Choksondik: Very very good, Token. You get a check plus.
Cartman: Aw, that is such bullcrap!
Cartman: No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!
Token: My family isn't rich.
Cartman: Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
Token: But I...
Kyle: Aharmani Exchange?
Stan: Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.
Token: I know. But why?
Bob: ...W-well, because we went to graduate school and therefore have more lucrative jobs than most people in town. For instance, your mother is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company, whereas your friend Eric Cartman's mother is a crack whore. One pays more than the other.
Linda: Why, sweetie? What's the matter?
Token: All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.
Bob: ...Oh.
Token: I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!
Bob: You... sure you want to do this, son?
Linda: Hmmm...
Bob: Where's the... valet?
Linda: He must be parkiing someone else's car.
Token: That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting.
Obese Woman: Aisle 6, next to the pretzels.
Linda: What, what brand are they?
Liane: Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.
Bob: S-son, can you just hurry it up? I don't think we quite fit n here.
Cartman: Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.
Stan: Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?
Token: I sure did.
Cartman: Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.
Token: Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart.
Token: It's a DVD of the Lion King
Stan: DVD? We don't own a DVD player.
Craig: Don't you have a VHS of it?
Token: I only have this.
Token: What's a VHS?
Jada Pinkett Smith: "Like Aspen was 30 years ago." Sounds nice.
Will Smith: We could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing! And then I could finally live like a cowboy.
Jada Pinkett Smith: Oh Will, the country would be such a nicer place to raise our kids!
Older Boy: Yes, Daddy?
Will Smith: How would you like to move to the Colorado Rockies?
Older Boy: The mountains, Daddy?
Girl: Can we have horses?
Older Boy: O can we? Can we Daddy?
Will Smith: You bet!
Kids: Hooray!
Will Smith: Well, here it is. Our home to be.
Jada Pinkett Smith: Oh, Will, it's beautiful.
Will Smith: Why thank you, young man. We're the Smiths.
Token: I'm Token.
Lisa: Our daddy is a very famous actor. What does your daddy do?
Token: Aah, he's a lawyer. I think.
Will Smith: How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Token while your mother and I check out the town.
Token: ...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.
Frederick: Yes, yes, we have one of those, too. In fact, we have seven of them, I believe.
Daniel: Why?
Lisa: Why? What happened to all their money?
Token: Well, they never really had any money.
Lisa: Well, then, why don't their daddies just act in a movie?
Token: Well I... think that.. they...
Frederick: Sometimes children must be very firm with their daddies.
Lisa: Indeed.
Frederick: Like when Daddy doesn't want to act in a movie because he thinks the script is bad.
Lisa: "I want a llama, Daddy!"
Frederick: "I'd do the picture, Daddy!"
Lisa: "Please, Daddy!"
Frederick: "Daddy, please!"
Lisa: "Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!"
Frederick: And so Daddy does the picture.
Token: ...That's ...great.
Lisa: Twenty million dollars great.
Engineer: Sorry, Snoop Dogg, but Will Smith is on line three for you?
Snoop Dogg: Couldn't be better. I'm just laying down some vocals for my new album.
Snoop Dogg: Oho yes, the kids bug me about it all the time.
Will Smith: Well I found the place, Snooty-roo. It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered, laid-back, and beautiful.
Snoop Dogg: Ogh. It sounds lovely!
Will Smith: You really should come give it a look. Jada and I would love for some friends to move here with us.
Snoop Dogg: I certainly will, William. And perhaps I'll give ol' Maigc and Kobe Bryant a call. They've been looking for vacation properties as well.
Will Smith: Great! Well, let me let you get back to your recording.
Mr. Garrison: That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.
Gerald: Hey! W-what are you saying? What "types"?
Jimbo: Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.
Ned: Nnnope.
Jimbo: I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!
Skeeter: They're gonna be sending their kids to our schools, and mixin' them with our pure, non-rich kids!
Mr. Garrison: Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs!
Skeeter: Damn, I hate those stupid richers!
Jimbo: I guess we showed them!
Frederick: Token, these are Oprah's newly-adopted children, Dominique and Zizi.
Token: Hi.
Frederick: Ah, and these are Puff Daddy's kids: P Diddy Mini, P Poofy Bite-size, and Poppa Diddy Diddy Puff Fun-size.
Token: Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding.
Lisa: Oh no, we're going shopping.
Skeeter: They've got nice expensive beers for you across the street at the new Wolfgang Puck's.
Barkeep: ...Maybe you didn't see the sign out front: This bar is for people livin' below their means ONLY!
Men: Yeah!
Kobe Bryant: This is a free country. I can have a drink wherever I want.
Ned: Nn-what do you mean?
Mr. Garrison: How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase "t"!
Jimbo: Lowercase "t"?
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, for "time to leave"!
Bar Patrons: Yeah!
Mr. Garrison: Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase "t"! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready!
Mr. Garrison: Alright!
Kobe Bryant: Tee. T- Time to- leave?
Skeeter: I think we scared 'im.
Men: Yeah!
Frederick: Now Token, polo is very simple. You simply must hit the williard into some cilium with your fracaman.
Players: Tally ho!
Player 1: Oh!
Player 2: Yay!
Player 3: This is exciting.
Player 4: Oh, Frederick, this is wonderful!
Cartman: What in the hell are they doing?
Kyle: Is that fun?
Stan: I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
Cartman: Well, let's just play our game, then.
Kyle: Alright.
Kenny: (Ow!)
Frederick: You see, you must pay attention, Token. I was able to jollyrow your davishmere with a forecastle.
Player: A snowball fight?
Lisa: How barbaric.
Token: I don't fit in anywhere.
Passenger 1: Hey! What are you doing? If you're going to ride the bus in South Park, you're gonna have to sit in the FRONT!
Passengers: Yeah
Passenger 1: Yeah. How do you like that, richer?!
Bill Cosby: Well it's very nice, actually
Passenger 1: Yeah, I'll bet it is!
Bill Cosby: Very, very comfy.
Passenger 1: Uh huh, looks like it.
Chef: Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just- [he hears voices and spins around. A group of rich folk are marching in protest]
Millionaire Protesters: We shall perservere. We shall perservere.
Oprah Winfrey: You there, come march with us!
Chef: For what?
Oprah Winfrey: All the poor people in town think they can persecute and harass us decent rich folk.
Will Smith: So we're uniting and marching on the town square!
Millionaire Protesters: Yeah!
Chef: But... I'm not rich.
Chef: I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.
Will Smith: We'll give you a hundred dollars.
Millionaire Protesters: We shall perservere. We shall perservere.
Chef: [with the others] I shall perservere. We shall perservere.
Lion 1: What are you doing here, boy?
Token: You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!
Lion 2: You're not becoming a lion. The only way you can do that is to see Aslan.
Token: Who's Aslan?
Token: Are... you... Aslan?
Aslan: M-I am.
Aslan: So, you want to live with the lions, do you?
Token: Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.
Aslan: And what makes you think you can fit it with us?
Token: Well, I don't know.
Aslan: Do you like jokes?
Token: What?
Aslan: Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions love jokes.
Token: ...I like jokes a lot.
Token: So can I stay?
Aslan: He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think.
Skeeter: If they get that petition passed, it's all over.
Jimbo: I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.
Mr. Garrison: Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?
Skeeter: They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town.
Jimbo: ...Ghosts?
Mr. Garrison: Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED!
Men: Yeah!
Men: Alright! Yeah! Let's Go! Right!
Aslan: Yes? What is it, young lion apprentice?
Token: ...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.
Aslan: Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home.
Token: They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.
Aslan: It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum?
Aslan: Go on. It's spearmint!
Token: No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.
Aslan: Oh. So you don't want any gum then? Are you... sure? Go on, try it!
Will Smith: And so it is with great determination that us decent rich Americans have gathered to say: "We will be separated no more!"
Millionaires: Hooray!
Mayor McDaniels: This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws.
Millionaires: Yeah!
Mayor McDaniels: And I want to assure the nation that is watching that South Park is not a town of prejudice or bigotry.
Oprah Winfrey: What the-?
Millionaire 1: Carl, do you see what I see?
Skeeter: It's working!
Gerald: They're scared to death!
Token: Hey guys.
Stan: Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
Stan: Sure, dude, you're our friend.
Token: Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich.
Stan: Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
Butters: They sure do.
Stan: Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
Kyle: Right.
Token: That's right, huh?
Kyle: And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
Stan: Yeah, I get it for that.
Kyle: And Cartman for being fat.
Cartman: Uh huh.
Kyle: And Cartman for being stupid.
Cartman: Yeah.
Kyle: And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
Cartman: Hey.
Kyle: And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole
Cartman: Ey, you did me already!
Token: You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich.
Stan: Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.
Token: You're not?
Kyle: No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
Skeeter: That was it. We just saw the last of them speeding away in a van!
Men: Alright!
Gerald: They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!
Mr. Garrison: That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires!
Jimbo: But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.
Randy: Yeah. You'd become what you hate.
Mr. Garrison: Well yeah, but at least I got rid of all those damn ni-
Ms. Sanders: What?
Doctor: Have you heard of stem-cell research?
Ms. Sanders: Uh-I've heard of it on the news, but... I don't know what it is.
Ms. Sanders: Oh well, I suppose, if it can help others.
Nurse: Yes, Doctor.
Stan: Well that burned a long time.
Stan, Kyle: Alright!
Kyle: You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
Kenny: (All right. I'm fine.)
Stan: What, Butters?
Butters: Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
Stan: Tell him we're busy.
Butters: Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
Kyle: Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
Cartman: Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
Stan: What?
Cartman: Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
Kyle: A trampoline?
Cartman: Better.
Stan: A boat?
Cartman: Better.
Kenny: (A football machine?)
Cartman: Better.
Stan: Well WHAT, Cartman?
Cartman: Mint condition, tax free.
Stan: Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
Cartman: Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
Cartman: Stem cells, numbnuts!
Stan: Stem cells?
Kyle: Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
Kenny: (What the fuck are stem cells?)
Kyle: They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
Cartman: Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
Butters: Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
Chris: Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!
Linda: Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.
Butters: Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
Butters: We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.
Butters: Dad's a good shopper all right.
Butters: You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
Butters: Sure I do!
Butters: I'm back, Ma!
Linda: Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?
Linda: Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?
Butters: Well first, he went to see a movie.
Linda: A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.
Linda: Wait a minute. What was the movie called?
Linda: Oh my God...
Butters: Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
Linda: Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?
Butters: To the gym.
Linda: To the gym?
Butters: Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.
Butters: Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
Chris: Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.
Linda: Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!
Butters: Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.
Butters: One please.
Butters: Hello? Eh-anybody in here?
Butters: Uh, Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison: ...Who is that?!
Mr. Slave: This room's taken.
Butters: I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
Chris: Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.
Butters: Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
Butters: Little white lies?
Chris: You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.
Butters: ...Uh, who's Jack?
Chris: Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane.
Butters: Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.
Chris: It won't? Oh, good.
Butters: Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
Chris: You... what?
Linda: No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.
Butters: Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
Butters: Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
Linda: And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.
Butters: Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
Linda: If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.
Linda: Stay away from me, bastard!
Chris: Linda, I know this is very hard-
Chris: I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!
Chris: It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!
Linda: There is no going back, Chris!
Chris: Sure there is!
Chris: What?
Reporter 1: Mrs. Stotch? Mrs. Stotch? Any word yet from the man who took your son?
Linda: No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us.
News 4 Reporter: Mrs. Stotch, what did the kidnapper look like?
Linda: Puerto Rican.
Reporter 2: Was he tall? Short?
Linda: He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me.
Butters: And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands." Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister.
Truck Driver: Yeah. Too bad you're not a broad, 'cause I need some God-damned poontang.
Butters: Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this?
Barbrady: Who is this?
Butters: Uh, is this the Stotch residence?
Barbrady: Yes. Are you calling about the abduction?
Butters: ...No.
Barbrady: Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican?
Police Chief: Really?
Patsy Ramsey: Our daughter was killed a few years ago, in our house.
Linda: Yes, I... remember hearing something about that.
John Ramsey: A and we realized... The man that murdered your son must be the same person that killed our daughter!
John Ramsey: No, huh.
Patsy Ramsey: No.
Chris: Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't know that he's dead yet.
The Ramseys: Riiight.
Butters: Sir? Hello?
Butters: Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.
Mechanic: Sarrih, wife took the car to Estes Park for the weekend. Won't be back until Sunday, hyeah. I can give you a ride Sunday, if ya like.
Butters: I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
Mechanic: Well, then, looks like you're walkin'.
Mechanic: Well, uh good luck then.
John Ramsey: It's so very hard to lose a loved one, isn't it?
Chris: Yes, it, it sure is.
Patsy Ramsey: Thank goodness we have each other to share our grief.
Linda: Thank goodness.
A Politician: John! Patsy!
Chris: Yes, I'd I sure hope we do.
Gary Condit: I spoke with the FBI and Some Puerto Rican Guy has just made their Number One Most Wanted, heh.
Linda: Oh. Sure.
Patsy Ramsey: O.J.'s wife was killed by an uh, Some Puerto Rican Guy, too.
O.J. Simpson: Yup, it was Some Puerto Rican Guy all right.
John Ramsey: So you see, Chris and Linda, there are people like you all over the country who've been affected by Some Puerto Rican Guy.
Gary Condit: Hey! Let's make Chris and Linda an official part of the group.
John Ramsey: Yeah!
Patsy Ramsey: Yeah!
O.J. Simpson: Alright!
Gary Condit: Gooble gobble gooble gobble!
The Ramseys and Condit: One of us! One of us!
O.J. Simpson: One of us! Gooble gobble!
Linda: I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!
Butters: Happy Anniversary!
Chris: Not now, Butters!
Butters: Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
Linda: Oh, my baby's back!
Butters: I ain't grounded, am I?
Butters: Lie?
Linda: Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.
Linda: Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!
Butters: Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.
Linda: You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!
Butters: Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.
Chris: Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!
Chris: ...Butters... You're as right as rain.
Butters: Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
Butters: ...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
Man in Crowd: Wow, alright
Stan: Butters was missing?
Chris: But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.
Linda: We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
Chris: You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.
Cartman: Huho!
Butters: Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!
Stan: Damn, dude.
Linda: We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
Chris: And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.
Stan: Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
Butters: Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
Cartman: We sure are.
Butters: I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
Stan: Really?
Butters: Naw, I'm lyin'
Tuong Lu Kim: Herro, Shitty Wok, take your order prease.
Tuong Lu Kim: Yes, this Shitty Wok
Kyle: Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken.
Butters: Uh, hey, fellas.
Stan: Hey Kenny.
Kyle: Okay, Not-Kenny.
Kyle: Dude! That's today!
Kyle: Excuse me? Could we get through here?
Worker: Mr. Fogle, some fans wanted to see if you'd sign their sandwich?
Butters: Wow, Jared!
Kyle: Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
Jared: I sure did! And- Well- Well I, I also had a little help on the side.
Stan: What kind of help?
Cartman: A- AIDS?
Jared: That's right. I got aides about two years ago and I've been losing weight ever since. It's amazing how slim you can get with aides.
Stan: I'll bet you can.
Jared: Would you like to meet them?
Scott, Tyler: Hello.
Jared: Yep. Hooray for aides!
Kyle: Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
Jared: I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides.
Kyle: But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
Jared: Y- you think so. Well, why... should it matter?
Jared: Hmmm.
Kyle: That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
Stan: Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
Kyle: Tha- that's diarrhea.
Cartman: Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.
Kyle: That's a great idea!
Cartman: Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
Cartman: Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
Butters: Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.
Cartman: I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
Kyle: But Butters isn't fat.
Cartman: That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.
Stan: He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
Butters: But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
Cartman: Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
Butters: You mean like Jared?
Kyle: Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
Sharon: Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda.
Linda: Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!
Stephen: Yeah. We figure that if our boys are gonna be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too.
Randy: Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.
Stan: He's such a douchebag.
Stephen: And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend.
Gerald: A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that.
Stephen: No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation.
Randy: They let you stay for free?
Stephen: Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!
Sheila: Well that sounds like a good deal.
Randy: Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
Stephen: Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend!
Sheila: Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!
Stephen: Where are Butters and Eric?
Stan: They're still asleep.
The Parents: Hello.
Josh: You folks enjoying the condo?
Sheila: It's lovely. Thank you.
Kyle: What?
Cartman: So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
Stan: What's a Hitler?
Cartman: You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?
Stan: No, I never have.
Cartman: Shh-shh, here he comes.
Phil: Well, we can't wait to show you what Aspen Time-Share is offering investors. Shall we do our thirty-minute meeting?
Randy: Oh, do we have to do it right now?
Josh: Well, best to do it and get it out of the way.
Sheila: Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill.
The Boys: Okay.
Butters: Hey, do you guys smell that?
Stan: Smell what?
Butters: Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
Butters: Wuh, that's my face, sir.
Butters: Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?
Thumper: Okay, let's have the little dude at the end try first! What's your name?
Ike: Iiiiike!
Kyle: Go on, Ike.
Thumper: Okay, you see what he did?! He French-fried when he should've pizza'd. You French-fry when you pizza, you're gonna have a bad time!
Phil: And so, we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in Phase 4.
Josh: That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity!
Gerald: I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.
Randy: Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.
Phil: Oh, I know, that's what everybody says - "Not me, I can't afford it." But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars!
Josh: Wow!
Sheila: For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?
Randy: So then it's not really ours.
Phil: Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, "I've got a little place in Aspen."
Josh: Try it. Try saying it. "I've got a little place in Aspen."
The Parents: I've got a little place in Aspen.
Phil: Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary "I've got a nice little place in Aspen?" Hahaha! Just kidding, wives.
Phil: Woll uh, you still gotta come to the time-share luncheon. We did give you a free condo for the weekend.
Gerald: Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.
Stan: Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
Stan: Uhh... no.
Stan: Stan. Marsh.
Tad: Alright, how about a race, then? You and me.
Stan: Dude, I'm just learning.
Stan: I never said I was.
Tad: Oooooooo!
Tad's friends: Oooooooo!
Phil: And THAT is why owning a piece of an Aspen condo is not only possible,...
Josh: It's downright smart!
Phil: Op, here it is! As promised, a fabulous free lunch!
Gerald: Wow, filet mignon' and lobster!
Josh: It's nice to feel rich, isn't it.
Randy, Gerald: What?
Randy: Wait...
Phil: You see? That's the great thing about time-share. You get a little taste of luxuries you can't afford.
Josh: And then share it with the people that come tomorrow.
Randy: All right, look, we've been here for over three hours.
Gerald: Yeah. Can we go now, please?
Josh: They got the red sticker?!
Phil: They got the red sticker!
Stephen: What's the red sticker?
Josh: Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes.
Randy: No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.
Stephen: O-all right!
Stan: ...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
Stan: Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
Tad: Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take Heather out for some fondue tonight, do ya?
Heather: Sorry, Stan, it's just that when it comes to skiing, Tad has all the right moves.
Heather: You aren't mad, are you, Stan? I mean, a girl's gotta look out for her best interests.
Stan: All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
Tad and friends: Oooooooo!
Tad: Alright, fine. You and me at the summit, now!
Stan: Okay.
Tad's friends: Race! Race!
Tad: Hah! You're going down, little boy!
Stan: Yeah, prob'ly.
Stan: Fries... fries...
Butters: U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.
Stan: Thanks. Who are you?
Gerald: Finally, we get to go skiing!
Randy: Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.
Lift Operator: Can I help you?
Stephen: Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company?
Lift Operator: Ooooh, go right on ahead, folks.
Gerald: Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody.
Stephen: Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo!
Phil: Welcome back, folks!
Josh: We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about!
Randy: Oh, God-damnit!
Kyle: Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
Teen Girl: I'm glad you guys came. Do you like our youth center?
Stan: It seems fine.
Voguing Skier: Yeah, too bad we're getting shut down. That hot-shot skier Tad's father is gonna bulldoze the building.
Voguing Skier 2: Where are all us kids supposed to go?
Kyle: What do you wanna do now?
Stan: I dunno.
Tad: Yeah!
Stan: Dude, what the hell is your problem?!
Tad and friends: OooOOOOOOoooooo!
Stan: I raced you, You won!
Tad: A rematch? Oh, Darsh. You're even dumber than I thought.
Teen Boy: He'll ski you anytime, anywhere!
Teens: Yeah!
Stan: What?
Stan: I'll be there, you queen!
Stan: Yeah!
Tad: Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought... Again! See ya tomorrow.
Butters: Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?
Stan: Dude, I have to!
Stan: Dude, he's got Heather!
Kyle: You don't even know Heather!
Stan: I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
Stan: ...Thank you.
Stan: This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
Phil: ...And so you see it's the investment opportunity that keeps on giving.
Gerald: How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!
Josh: And we certainly don't want to pressure you.
Gerald: Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!
Phil: Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want. Of course, that is, if you don't want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show.
Phil: That's only a couple thousand each, Josh!
Randy: Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!
Gerald: My God, can you believe those people?!
Josh: That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!
Thumper: K-13?! But you're just a beginner! You ski outta your league, you're gonna have a bad time.
Stan: I have to do this, okay? I have to!
Thumper: Alright, well, if you gotta get good at somethin' really fast, there's only one way to do it. Come on!
Randy: All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!
Phil: That's not true, officers, we said they could leave at any time.
Phil: That's right!
Randy: Oh, Jesus.
Phil: Now, you're probably asking yourselves... "Can my time-share condo turn into a profit?"
Josh: "What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?"
Phil: The answer might astonish you. For over ten years investors have seen their-
Announcer: The powder is fresh and the stage is set for Tad versus Stan on the K-13!
Tad: This time you're not just gonna lose, you're gonna die!
Stan: Pizza... pizza... pizza...
Man In Yellow Jacket: Tad's got the lead.
Tad: Heh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let all these hamsters go. That should distract him just long enough for me to win the race!
Kyle: Good job, dude!
Sheila: There you are, boys!
Kyle: Mom, Dad!
Stan: Where the hell have you guys been?!
Stephen: Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office.
Randy: Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!
Stan: Hm, that sounds pretty good.
"Kenny": (Gosh darn it, my name's not Kenny!)
Butters: Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
Kyle: Okay, Not-Kenny.
Stan: Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povich freak show is on.
Maury: Our next guest is a little girl who was born without a midsection. Please welcome Damla Jones.
Cartman: Aww, sick dude!
Damla: Uh-uh, yes. It is.
Damla: Sometimes.
Damla: Sometimes.
Maury: Well your mommy told us you like to listen to music.
Damla: Yes.
Kyle: This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
Announcer: Do you or someone you know have a disfigurement or disability that we can exploit on the Maury Povich show? If so, call 1-555-HEY MAURY!
Kyle: Cool!
Stan: What disease should we say?
Cartman: Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!
Kyle: Awesome!
Butters: Cool!
Stan: This is gonna be so funny!
Butters: Uh, it sure is!
Kyle: But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
Butters: Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
Kyle: Yeah.
Butters: We-ell hold on a second, you guys.
Butters: Hang on now.
Kyle: Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
Butters: Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
Stan: It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
Cartman: Yeah.
Butters: But fellas, if I go on Maury Povich, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
Kyle: We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
Cartman: Yeah.
Butters: Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?
Brunet Trekker: Now, we're going to apply the latex with some spirit gum.
Butters: Hey that spirit gum sure is stinky.
Stan: Where's you get the balls from?
Brunet Trekker: We made a plastic mold of his chin, and then made a latex scrotum and put two golf balls inside.
Cartman: Nice.
Stan: Wow!
Kyle: That looks awesome!
Butters: Aw, I feel silly.
Cartman: They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
Brunet Trekker: Wooww!
Blond Trekker: They weren't lying!
Blond Trekker: Here, damnit!
Brunet Trekker: Hey, hey! Stop it, man!
Announcer: Gay Air Flight 243 with service to New York now ready for general boarding.
Stan: That's your flight, Butters.
Stan: Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
Cartman: God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?
Kyle: Yeah, he sure is.
Cartman: Buh-ters! Buh-ters!
Stagehand: Thanks for coming on the show, kid. Maury is very excited to meet you. And this is the Green Room where you can hang out with the other guests until we call for you on set. Boy with Balls on Chin, meet Man with Foot on Head, Girl with Rapid Aging Disease, Disfigured Country Singer, and Man With No Face.
Butters: Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
Disfigured Country Singer: Yeah, we told you last time we want fresher vegetables.
Disfigured Country Singer: ...Boy with balls on his chin. Haven't seen you around. How long have you been on the circuit?
Butters: What circuit?
Man with Foot on Head: The talk-show circuit. Don't tell us this is your first one.
Butters: Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?
Man With No Face: Oprah two times, Jenny Jones once, Sally Jessie five times.
Man With No Limbs: I'm doing Jenny tomorrow.
Disfigured Country Singer: Yeah, you picked a good show to do first, kid, but you need to learn the ropes. There are a lot of people like you all over the country, and we all do talk shows for a living.
Man with Foot on Head: We all know each other and we kinda stick together to make sure our industry is protected.
Man With No Face: Yeah. Like when someone LIES about being a freak.
Man With No Limbs: We don't take kindly to that.
Butters: Well I can certainly see why.
Man With No Limbs: It's okay. Folks don't do it anymore. Not after what they saw what we did to Lobster Boy.
Butters: Lobster Boy?
Disfigured Country Singer: But then we all found out that Lobster Boy wasn't a real freak at all. He was just an actual lobster.
Man with Foot on Head: So you know what we did to him?
Butters: What?
Disfigured Country Singer: Now Lobster Boy is no more.
Butters: Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.
Man with Foot on Head: We're glad you agree.
Stagehand: Okay, Boy with balls on his chin, you're up next.
Stan: Here he comes.
Kyle: This is gonna be awesome!
Maury: Our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin.
Butters: Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose.
Maury: So, is it tough being ...different?
Butters: Uhhh, yeah.
Maury: And do all the kids at school make fun of you?
Cartman: Uh oh, we're losin' him.
Butters: I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.
Maury: Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?
Butters: Uh what condition?
Butters: I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.
Stan, Kyle: Phew.
Cartman: Oh, that was close.
Maury: What names do they call you at school?
Maury: And do they call you "freak" and "weirdo"?
Butters: Well yeah, I s'pose.
Butters: Uh, sure.
Maury: Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you.
Stan, Kyle: Wait, here it is, here it is!
Cartman: The present.
Maury: Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world!
Butters: Oh really?
Kyle: Wow!
Cartman: Did he say "the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world"?
Stan: But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
Kyle: Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
Cartman: Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
Cartman: What's the new topic?
Operator: Please help my out-of-control child.
Cartman: Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!
Cartman: Uh, sure!
Operator: Does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age?
Cartman: Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and potpourri, and queazies.
Operator: Well that's great! If you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out.
Cartman: Mmoooomm?
Liane: Yes, sweetie?
Cartman: Could you do me a favor?
Liane: What's that, my little man?
Cartman: Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt golf course in the wwoooorrlldd?
Liane: Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.
Cartman: I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?
Liane: Of course I do.
Cartman: Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.
Liane: Sweetie, don't.
Linda: Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!
Stephen: Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!
Butters: Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.
Stephen: Ugh! You'd better believe you won't, buster!
Butters: Oh Jesus! They were??
Stan: Yeah, they wanted to find you bad.
Butters: Well Oh, God! W-whatdya tell him?
Stan: I- told them where to find you.
Butters: What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
Butters: Oh, hello, folks. Uh what's the problem?
Disfigured Country Singer: There you are, Boy With Balls On His Chin.
Man with Foot on Head: We've got big news! The union is striking.
Disfigured Country Singer: We're tired of our crappy prizes! So the union president, Man with Terrible Skin Condition, has told us to round everyone up.
Butters: Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.
Man with Foot on Head: Grounded for what?
Man With No Face: Good, then you can march with us. Freaks of the world,
Studio Audience: Ooohhhhhhhh.
Maury: Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework.
Maury: Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen.
Cartman: Jeez, that girl is pissed off.
Liane: I'm glad you're not like that, poopsie-kins.
Stagehand: Second door on the right.
The Freaks: Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
The Freaks: Yeah!
The Freaks: Yeah!
Butters: Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.
Hammerhead Man: You're not gonna picket?
Butters: NO I I'm not a scab.
Man with Terrible Skin Condition: Now, we will split up into groups and form picket lines. The first group will be led by: Incredibly Obese Black Man.
Incredibly Obese Black Man: Excuse me, I'm not Incredibly Obese Black Man, I'm Incredibly Black Obese Man.
Announcer: And now, back to more kids who are out of control, on the Maury Povich show!
Maury: Our next mother is Liane Cartman. Her son claims to be the most out-of-control kid in the world and says there's nothing his stupid mom can do about it.
Studio Audience: Awww.
Maury: So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child?
Liane: Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle.
Liane: Oh, he's such a cutie.
Maury: Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do?
Liane: Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear.
Liane: Oh, I mean, sex and drugs.
Studio Audience: Oooohhh!
Vanity: Oh, what-evah. You ain't tough, ho! I roam with gangs!
Cartman: What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition: What do we want?
The Freaks: Better prizes!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition: When do we want them?
The Freaks: Now!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition: What do we want?
The Freaks: Better prizes!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition: When do we want them?
The Freaks: Now!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition: Napoleon, you need to understand something: for a union to work all members must be prepared to make sacrifices and stick together.
Butters: But I gotta get back to my family.
The Freaks: Better prizes!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition: When do we want them?
The Freaks: Now!
Police Captain: Okay folks, we're gonna have to move along.
Man with Foot on Head: Why? We're a union and we have a right to picket.
Police Captain: I'm sorry, but the government does not recognize you as a union. You'll have to go.
Middle Dwarf: What are you saying? That because of our appearance our organization is less important?
Police Captain: Now now now, I'm not telling you people that your union doesn't matter, I'm just telling you that you're not really... people.
Man with Foot on Head: ...Alright, that does it! It's time to bring out the big guns! Prepare the video sabotage!
Butters: Oh no, not the video sabotage, uh.
Announcer: Who is the most out of controlled child? We're back with Maury.
Maury: We're here, talking with moms who think their children are out of control.
Vanity: What evah!
Cartman: I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
Studio Audience: Aawwww.
Joline: Mmhmm, that's right Maurih.
Joline: Maurih, it's like this: Whenever I have friends over to the house Chantal will come waltzin' in the livin' room completely naked!
Studio Audience: Ooohhh!
Vanity: Whatevah. I helped in a drive-by shooting.
Cartman: What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
Maury: Wow, that is out of control!
Joline: Why, just last night I had three gentlemen callers over to my house, and Chantal took her clothes off right in front o' everybody!
Maury: Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-
Cameraman: Sir, the ratings have just started to plummet.
Man with Foot on Head: We did it! The strike worked!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition: Now we can go on with our careers!
Butters: Oh. Double hamburgers.
Man with Foot on Head: Jesus Christ! That out-of-control kid ripped poor Napoleon's balls right off!
Incredibly Obese Black Man: Get him!
Ms. Choksondik: Okay children, step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - I mean, rancher.
Rancher: Hello, boys and girls. My name is Rancher Bob.
Ms. Choksondik: Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob.
Kids: Hi, Rancher Bob.
Rancher Bob: I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful world of beef. Follow me.
Kids: Eewwww!!
Rancher Bob: Hey, anybody want a free sample?
Stan: Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
Rancher Bob: Yeppir.
Kyle: Then why the hell do they call it "veal"??
Rancher Bob: Well, if we called it "little baby cow" people might not eat it.
Stan: Yeah, I wouldn't have.
Butters: Huh, me neither.
Kyle: What??
Cartman: Alriiight!
Kyle: Yeah.
Cartman: Where are we going?
Stan: We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
Cartman: What? Why?
Kyle: 'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!
Cartman: So?
Stan: So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
Butters: Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the "Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."
Kyle: What?!
Cartman: Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
Kyle: Screw you, Cartman!
Stan: Go on, dude it's the only way.
Kyle: No!
Stan: Just do it really fast, and we can go.
Kyle: Have Butters kiss it.
Kyle: Sick! I felt it on my face!
Stan: Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!
Butters: Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entering. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."
Cartman: Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
Kyle: You need to freeze some of your ass off.
Butters: Huuh what's the matter?
Stan: They aren't leaving.
Kyle: Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
Butters: No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
Stan: Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
Kyle: Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
Stan: I don't know.
Cartman: I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
Kyle: Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
Butters: Eh yeah I do too!
Cartman: Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
Stan: We won't have to. Butters said he had something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
Kyle: Butters had that at his house?
Butters: I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
Kyle: All right!
Stan: What?
Butters: "Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"
Kyle: Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?
Butters: Eh, you think it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.
Officer Barbrady: Hello, Mrs. Marsh.
Sharon: Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?
Officer Barbrady: Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property.
Rancher Bob: I followed a calf-curling trail right to your house, ma'am.
Shelly: Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.
Stan: Aw crap!
Sharon: Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?
Randy: Stanley, they belong to him.
Stan: They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
Shelly: Let me hit him, Mom!
Stan: No!
Randy: Stan, you're behaving like a kid!
Sharon: Open this door, now!
Butters: Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.
Sharon: I apologize for this, Mr. rancher person.
Rancher Bob: Oh, why, why don't you just tell them that the cows will be safe. And when they come out I can take them back.
Sharon: I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life.
Rancher Bob: Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's eight hundred dollars' worth of veal up there and I have to ship it out Friday. What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady?
Kyle: So what happens now?
Stan: I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
Kyle: We're with you, dude.
Butters: Yeah.
Cartman: I want out.
Kyle: We're with you, Stan.
Butters: Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
Stan: Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
Kyle, Butters: Yeah!
Cartman: Yeah! Wait-what?
Sharon: And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promise them the calves will live free, in writing.
Sharon: Well excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!
Stan: Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
Stephen: Butters? Answer me!
Stephen: Butters! Right now!
Butters: Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?
Stephen: WHAT?!
Butters: Oh, sweet Jesus.
Sharon: Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!
Stan: This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until we know the calves will be safe.
Sharon: Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizzas and ice cream.
Kyle: Cartman, stay away from that door!
Cartman: We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!
Stan: Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
Stan: Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
Randy: Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.
Sheila: Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours!
Liane: Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.
Sharon: Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all.
Liane: Oh, all right.
Sheila: Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.
Butters: Good night, fellas!
Kyle: Good night.
Cartman: Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.
Cartman: Can't go on. Need... food...
Kyle: We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
Cartman: There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.
Stan: No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!
Cartman: Food!
Sharon: Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?
Liane: Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer.
Sheila: Oh dear God, you've ruined everything.
Kyle: All right!
Stan: See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
Cartman: Look you guys! Beef jerky!
Kyle, Cartman: Mmmmm.
Stan: Dude, what are you guys doing?
Kyle: We're eating, dude.
Stan: You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
Kyle: Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
Butters: Me neither.
Cartman: Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.
Field Reporter: Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where four insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle.
Field Reporter: Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say.
Randy: We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!
Field Reporter: The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists.
Butters: Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.
Stan: No, this is exactly what we wanted.
Kyle: It is?
Stan: Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
Butters: Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
Voices: We must help the helpless, we must save the unsaved
Kyle: Huh, what the hell is that?
Cartman: Hippies!
Hippies: Hooray! Hooray!
Kyle: Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?
Butters: Ew, they're all dirty.
Cartman: What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
FBI Agent: Who's in charge here?
Officer Barbrady: I am. But I don't want to be.
FBI Agent: Where's the negotiator?
FBI Negotiator: Right here! Glen Dumont, Negotiator Squad.
FBI Agent: All right, see what you can do.
Kyle: Dude, are you okay?
Butters: What is that?
Kyle: Dude, maybe we should end this.
Stan: No!
Officer Barbrady: The terrorists already said there's no way they're coming out.
Stan: Hello?
Glen Dumont: Hello, my name is Mike. I'm a negotiator. Is it okay if I talk to you?
Kyle: Don't give him anything!
Stan: What do I say??
Glen Dumont: I'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. You want that, right?
Cartman: Sure, sure.
Glen Dumont: How about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other.
Cartman: What do you have in mind?
Glen Dumont: Well, how about you send out one of the calves?
Cartman: Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
Glen Dumont: Just one, that's all we want.
Cartman: All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
Stan: Cartman, no!
Glen Dumont: What? I, I can't do that.
Cartman: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
Glen Dumont: No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuh, you're right. What reason do you have to trust me? I'm just a guy from Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? Just a blue-collar guy like your dad.
Cartman: Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
Glen Dumont: We're giving the boys some guns in return for a calf.
Randy: What?
Sharon: You're giving my baby guns?
Glen Dumont: Alright, you see that? I keep my end of the bargain.
Glen Dumont: Well, ha- how about you send out two calves?
Stan: O-ogh...
Glen Dumont: What do you have in mind?
Sheila: You're giving them a missile??
Cartman: Mike, speak.
Glen Dumont: How are we doin'?
Cartman: We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?
Cartman: Good, good.
Glen Dumont: But I couldn't get you North and South Dakota.
Cartman: Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.
Glen Dumont: All right, everythng has worked out. The boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them.
Adults: Yes! All right! Woohoo!
Officer Barbrady: Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator.
FBI Agent: They're coming out now?
Glen Dumont: Yes. All we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to Denver International Airport, where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to Mexico.
Sharon: What??
Randy: Jesus Christ!
FBI Agent: All right, that does it! You are in fact the worst negotiator I've ever seen in action!
Glen Dumont: All right, all right, I'll give you that. But in return, I want three staples.
Officer Barbrady: But isn't that dishonest?
FBI Agent: Maybe so, but if we don't do something soon, there could be fifty, even sixty people who'll have to go without veal for dinner. Are you prepared to let that happen?
FBI Agent: All right. Where is Mr. Dorn?
FBI Agent: I'm sorry, Mr. Dorn. It's FBI business. We've got terrorists making demands and we need your help.
Michael Dorn: This is highly unusual!
Cartman: And Worf?
Kyle: They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
Cartman: Step back! Tell those men to step back!
FBI Agent: Do it!
Hippies: All right! Woohoo! Yeah!
Michael Dorn: Where am I supposed to drive to?
Cartman: No. See, you must say, "Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"
Michael Dorn: Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?
Cartman: You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
Michael Dorn: This whole thing is ridiculous!
Field Reporter: Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom.
Butters: Okay Cartman!
Boys: All right!
Cartman: Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
Michael Dorn: We cannot keep going fast on these icy roads!
Michael Dorn: Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads.
Cartman: Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
Kyle: Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
Kyle: Oh no! No!!
Cartman: What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
Michael Dorn: I'm NOT killing anybody!
Cartman: Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
Stan: We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!
Michael Dorn: Can I go now?
Officer Barbrady: Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you.
Officer Barbrady: What do you mean?
Rancher Bob: In the twenty-four hours since the word "veal" was officially changed to "little tortured baby cow" the market has gone dry. Seems that people see "little tortured baby cow" on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'.
Butters: Really?
Rancher Bob: Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life.
Dr. Doctor: He's very lucky you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis.
Randy: Vaginitis?
Dr. Doctor: It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy.
Kyle: Whoa, dude.
Dr. Doctor: We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading.
Cartman: Thank God we stopped it in time.
Stan: Well, I guess we learned something today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
Butters: Hear hear.
Sheila: All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.
Stephen: I'll say!
Butters: Aw, we're still grounded?
Kyle: But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
Gerald: Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer.
The Boys: All right!
Kyle: Do we have everything?
Stan: Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anything!
Cartman: All right!
Kyle: Look, it's almost time.
Announcer: Up next on HBC, the Russell Crowe Show!
Stan: Alright, here we go.
Stan: Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!
Shelly: Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy.
Shelly: The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!
Stan: It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
Kyle: It's the biggest night of the year.
Stan: But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
Shelly: No, turds!
Cartman: Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
Shelly: Shut up, fat turd!!
Cartman: I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!
Russell Crowe: Come on!
Man: Look, I apologize, but I was just--
Stan: But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
Stan: Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
Russell Crowe: Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't it, kids? But it looks like if we're gonna get in more fights, we're gonna have to go look for 'em.
Butters: Ehyeah!
Kyle: You'd miss the new trailer?
Stan: Dude, I'm not going.
Stan: Stan.
Kyle: Kyle.
Butters: Butters! Aw, I lose, huh?
Cartman: Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
Kyle: Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
Russell Crowe: Seems like no one else here wants to fight.
Cartman: Amen.
Russell Crowe: ...lets ask our old friend, Tugger. Where should we go fight people next, Tugger?
Tugger: TOOOOOOT
Man with Mustache: Oh my God! It's Russell Crowe!
Kyle: Who wants to tell him?
Cartman: I'll do it.
Cartman: Butters, could you take a seat, please?
Cartman: Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.
Butters: Wull what is it?
Butters: Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
Cartman: Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
Butters: Not working out?
Cartman: I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
Kyle: Lame.
Cartman: Lame, yes.
Butters: Well, but ah I can get better.
Stan: Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you look for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
Kyle: But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
Butters: Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
Cartman: Yes, well, we weren't.
Butters: Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.
Kyle: Phew.
Stan, Cartman: Phew.
Kyle: Hm, he took that pretty well, I think.
Cartman: Who cares?
Man 1: Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minestrone.
Ride Operator: O! Shut her down. Someone needs assistance.
Tweek: Oh man! This is too much pressure!
Cartman: Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
Kyle: Tweek.
Dougie: I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!
Linda: Good morning, Butters.
Butters: Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
Kyle: This looks pretty good.
Timmy: Timmay!
Cartman: Next?
Cartman: Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.
Ms. Choksondik: Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five.
Butters: Ms. Choksondik?
Butters: Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
Cartman: Uh, what's the question again?
Cartman: Five times one is of course...
Ms. Choksondik: Who are you?
Butters: Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
Ms. Choksondik: Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here?
Kyle: You're such a fatass, Cartman!
Cartman: Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!
Craig: Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb.
Butters: A note?
Cartman: All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?
Tweek: O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it!
Kyle: Timmy.
Kyle: Towelie.
Towelie: What?
Cartman: Just one more rose, Kyle.
Kyle: Jimmy.
Cartman: Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, "get the fudge out!" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
Dougie: I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.
Dougie: I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you.
Butters: Join me?
Dougie: Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.
Butters: But why?
Butters: Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
Dougie: Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?
Butters: Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
Dougie: General Disarray.
Cartman: Next please.
Kyle: Anything that'll impress us, Token.
Cartman: If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?
Announcer: There goes a hit to left field, and Foley's going to score.
All: Woohoo!
Kyle: Yeah! Isn't this great?!
Pip: Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?
Cartman: You don't drink tea at a baseball game, you French piece of crap!
Pip: Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then.
Cartman: Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
Man 3: Flood the world?
Man 4: My God!
Man 5: Dear Christ, who will save us?
Dougie: It's on all the way.
Cartman: I think Towelie is awesome.
Kyle: Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
Cartman: Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.
Cartman: Token's a smartass.
Cartman: Yeah. Do we really need another one?
Jimmy: There's some chocolates and lih-liquorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside.
Stan: That's great.
Kyle: Cool.
Stan: Suckup.
Butters: Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
Dougie: Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?
Worker 1: Is this it?
Dougie: What do we do now?
Kyle: Just stick it on.
Tweek: But what if I put it in the wrong place?
Stan: Just put it between its eyes.
Tweek: GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?
Stan: Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
Kyle: Yeah.
Butters: How are things... going with your new best friend?
Tweek: Arrrr!
Stan: Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
Kyle: Yeah.
Stan: Uh oh.
Cartman: Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
Tweek: It's not?
Cartman: No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
Kyle: No way.
Kyle: Nuh uh.
Cartman: Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
Kyle: No way.
Cartman: If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
Stan: Alright, I'll chip in.
Tweek: Gah! Me too.
Linda: Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!
Dougie: Professor Chaos!
Butters: Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
Dougie: I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.
Dougie: What dastardly deed are we doing now?
Dougie: Oh, awesome!
Dougie: They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.
Butters: He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
Dougie: So how do we build it?
Stan: Ready. Let's see 'em.
Stan: Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
Kyle: I told you, Cartman.
Stan: What are we gonna do with them?
Stan: Yeah, that'd be funny.
Cartman: Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!
Butters: General Disarray, are your parents home?
Dougie: No.
Butters: Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
Dougie: What?
Dougie: Oh, uh...
Butters: Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
News Anchor: The head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads.
Butters: I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
Woman: Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh.
Man 2: Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching.
Butters: Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.
News Anchor: The police say that instead of looking for the missing head, they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the Simpsons every day.
Butters: Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
Dougie: You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out.
Terrance: Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something.
Kyle: See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
Tweek: Jesus Christ, she's dead!!
Stan: Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
Terrance: Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.
Stan: Oh jeez, change the channel.
Stan: They found the sea men! It's only a matter of time before they find the women, too!
News Anchor: The autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined.
Kyle: Oh God!
Stan: We're dead!
Cartman: Tweek! Where are you going?
Tweek: They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!
Stan: Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
Tweek: What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
Kyle: Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
Cartman: In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.
Tweek: Rrrr-hr-hrrr!!!
Chef: Oh, well, hello there, children.
Stan: Chef, we did something kind of bad.
Kyle: We don't know who else to talk to.
Chef: Now, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?
Stan: We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach.
Cartman: We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
Dougie: ...Simpsons did it. They did it in episode 204.
Dougie: Simpsons did it!
Dougie: Simpsons did it!
Stan: This is it.
Cartman: Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
Tweek: Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"!
Stan: Yeah, stupid.
Cartman: Is it her?
Kyle: Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.
Stan: What do we do now?
Stan: Do you see the sea people.
Cartman: No, just a bunch of goo.
Stan: Yeah.
Tweek: [two people come down the hall] ...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!
Stan: Aaah!
Doctor 2: Hey, do you smell children?
Kyle: Got it!
Butters: Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
Dougie: Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
Dougie: Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come To This!"
Dougie: ...Simpsons did it.
Butters: Dwaah!!
Stan: The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
Chef: Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.
Stan: ...and then we put them back in the tank.
Kyle: It is?
Chef: Relax, children, drinkin' some brine shrimp can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else.
Tweek: Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah!
Cartman: G'night, guys.
Stan: How? How did that happen?
Kyle: Whoa.
Stan: They've already accomplished so much.
Tweek: They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.
Tweek: Hr!
Cartman: You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to put them all in.
Dougie: No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that.
Butters: Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
Butters: Aaaaah!
Dougie: Don't have a cow, man.
Butters: Oh sweet Jesus!
Woman: Can I help you?
Cartman: Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?
Woman: Your... mom told you?
Cartman: Do you have them or not?
Woman: We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.
Cartman: What's your name?
Woman: Frances Velman.
Frances: What are you doing?
Frances: Five? Vials?
Cartman: No, gallons.
Frances: Www-we don't have that much here.
Butters: Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!
Mr. Garrison: ...What the hell's wrong with him?
Stan: Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
Tweek: Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.
Tweek: Uh-uh huh.
Kyle: Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
Cartman: Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
Stan: That's cool.
Stan: ...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
Cartman: Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
Stan: Hm.
Kyle: Huh.
Stan, Kyle: Hey Butters.
Stan: Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
Butters: Cartman?
Cartman: Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
Cartman: Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
Mr. Garrison: That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?
Cartman: I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
Cartman: What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
Butters: They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it starts to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
Kyle: ...Yeah. So?
Cartman: Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
Stan: Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
Mr. Garrison: Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.
Chef: Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode.
Chef: Good for you!
Cartman: Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
Kyle: Hey! It's Tweek.
Tweek: Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.
Mr. Garrison: What's going on now?
Kyle: The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
Tweek: Gaaa-hah!
Tweek: NOW what's happening?
Stan: The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
Mr. Garrison: Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys.
Kyle: Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
Cartman: Why can't societies just live in peace?
Priest Maxi: Parents, it's that time of year again when the bishops and priests from around the country are organizing the Young Men's Catholic Retreat. This year, we're taking the boys on a weekend boat trip to discuss Jesus's role as the Navigator of our lives.
Stan: That sounds pretty fun.
Randy: Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.
Stan: What are they talking about?
Cartman: I don't know.
Tweek: Maybe they wanna kill us.
Randy: With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.
Richard: Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; your son's dead. But those of us with alive children need to be sure that Father Maxi's on the up-and-up.
Sharon: I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.
Randy: It couldn't hurt.
Stephen: Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth.
Counselor: Hi boys. My name is Ms. Gorache and I need to ask you a few questions about your priest, okaaay?
Boys: Okay.
Counselor: Okay. Would you say that Father Maxi is... nice? Or mean?
Stan: Um, cool.
Butters: Compassionate.
Cartman: Ih... in our... butt?
Counselor: You don't need to be ashamed or embarrassed. Just, did he ever try to put anything in your butt?
Stan: ...Like ...money? What?
Butters: You mean, like a goldfish?
Counselor: No, no. Did he ever try to put anything that belonged to him in your butt?
Thomas: This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids.
Roger: Yeah, what has Catholicism come to anyway?
Richard: That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too.
All: Yeah, yeah, alright.
Roger: If there was a god, why would he let our kids be molested in the first place?
Stephen: Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!
Randy: Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists.
Stan, Cartman: Hey.
Tweek: Arr!
Kyle: What are you guys doin'?
Stan: We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest ever put anything in our butts.
Kyle: In your butts?
Cartman: Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
Kyle: Why would he put anything in your butts?
Stan: We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
Cartman: Hm.
Stan: Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
Tweek: Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!
Kyle: Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
Cartman: Aw, dude, I think I might have it.
Stan: What?
Kyle: Yeah.
Kyle: Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
Cartman: What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
Kyle: It wouldn't work!
Cartman: Have you ever tried it?
Kyle: I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
Cartman: I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
Kyle: You're on, fat boy!
Randy: Stan, you're an atheist now!
Richard: You too, Tweek!
Tweek: I'm a what??
Priest Maxi: Fathers, I want to thank you all for coming.
Priest 2: I'm down almost seventy in Greenleaf.
Priest Maxi: Uh-yes, uh, I'm afraid if things keep going the way they are, we could lose our entire religion.
Elderly Priest: Yes, we've gotta stop these boys from goin' to the public!
Fat Priest: They've gotta know to keep their mouths shut!
Other Priests: That's right, yeah.
Priest Maxi: Right, and so... wa- wait a minute. What?
Priest 1: Yes, but we've got to find out why these children are suddenly finding it necessary to report that they're being molested. Stop the problem at its source.
Priest 2: Yes, but how?
Priest 4: We've got to stop this-
Elderly Priest: How do you mean?
Priest Maxi: Well, I mean, obviously, what we need to put a stop to is all the sexual misconduct that is allowed to take place in our churches, and not just tell the children not to tell anybody about it. I mean, right?
Priest 1: Well did any of the children you've molested come forward?
Priest Maxi: No.
Priest 1: Well, that's good.
Priest Maxi: No, I mean! I've never molested any of the children in my church!
Elderly Priest: Hih-it's okay, Father Maxi. We're all priests here; the doors are closed.
Priest 2: Father, uh, having sex with boys is part of the Catholic priest's way of life.
Priest Maxi: Dear God. This problem is much more severe than I could have possibly imagined. I have to go to the Vatican and get help.
Kyle: Well, Cartman?
Stan: Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
Kyle: Well, go on, smartass, and do it!
Cartman: I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!
Stan: You've had five, dude!
Kyle: No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
Kyle: Get the fuck out of here!
Italian Cardinal: Your Holiness, this is Father Maxi from America. He has brought this all to our attention.
Italian Cardinal: Adoramus te, Christe.
Other Cardinals: Et dominus...
Priest Maxi: That's right-wait. What?
French Cardinal: In France as well we are finding it harder and harder to... make love to our boys.
Moroccan Cardinal: In Morocco they have arrested five of my priests. It's only a matter of time before they get the rest of us.
Italian Cardinal: Father Maxi, what do you suggest we do to not get caught.
Italian Cardinal: It is not written anywhere in the Holy Document of Vatican Law that sex with-a boys is wrong..
British Cardinal: Speaking on behalf of the British Catholics, it is obvious that the priest doesn't realize that the Holy Document of Vatican Law can not be changed!
Priest Maxi: Gelgameks?
Randy: Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.
Stan: Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
Stan: What? He did.
Randy: Noho, it doesn't work that way, son.
Stan: Yeah it does.
Randy: No it doesn't.
Randy: Honey! Honey, come quick!
Priest Maxi: Look, people! I'm just trying to say that if we don't change the Holy Document of Vatican Law, then we might lose everyone to atheism!
French Cardinal: What exactly do you suggest we change, Father Maxi.
Another Cardinal: The Holy Document of Vatican Law states that a priest, bishop, or cardinal cannot get married, so where are we to get our sex?
French Cardinal: Women?
Gelgamek Cardinal: The Gelgamek vagina is three feet wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth. Do you really expect us to have sex with them?!
Priest Maxi: Wuh- okay, m-maybe we just need to forget about the Gelgameks for a second and focus-
Priest Maxi: I'm just saying, what works on planet Gelgamek isn't necessarily goin' ta work for the rest of us here, on Earth. You see? That's the problem we're having here.
Italian Cardinal: But-a the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed!
Priest Maxi: Why not?!
Another Cardinal: Because we don't know where it is.
Italian Cardinal: You see, Father, the Holy Document of Vatican Law has been hidden away deep in the Catacombs of-a St. Peter's below us. Hidden away so that it can never be changed.
Priest Maxi: But if we locate it we can make changes to it?
A Bishop: HA! Good luck, father! The document is guarded by water lizards, rattlesnakes and sand traps! The fools who have tried before to recover it met their deaths!
Priest Maxi: Well we have to try. Our religion is dying!
Tweek: Harrr!
Cartman: I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
Stan: So?
Cartman: Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.
Stan: Dude, look.
News Anchor: The Surgeon-General's response has made Americans change their eating habits almost instantly.
Kyle: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
FBI Agent: Ms. Stewart, we have some questions.
Old Monk: What do you seek, Father?
Priest Maxi: I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make revisions to it.
Priest Maxi: I have to try. Our religion is in trouble, and... and that scroll may be our only hope!
Linda: Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?
All: Ooohh.
Richard: Oh thanks, Sharon.
All: That's right, that's right.
British Cardinal: How did he make it past the water lizards?
The Clergy: Hail Queen Spider!
Italian Cardinal: O great Queen Spider, we seek a-your guidance.
Queen Spider: What do you ask of me?
British Cardinal: Great Queen Spider, we wish to change one of the Vatican rules.
Queen Spider: The Vatican rules cannot be changed. So saith the Spider.
Italian Cardinal: Go on, Priest Maxi. See if you can convince her.
Priest Maxi: Alright, that does it!!! I've had enough!!! You people have completely lost touch with the outside world! You sit in this big room with your Gelgameks and your Queen Spider, and none of it applies to what being a Catholic is all about!!
A Bishop: But the Holy Document of Vatican Law states that-
Cartman: O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
Kyle: You were totally, one hundred percent right.
Kyle: You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
A Man: Yeah, the pope is gone!
Randy: Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!
Linda: Score one for us atheists!
Italian Cardinal: Gone! It's all gone!
British Cardinal: Well, thanks a lot, Father Maxi. You've killed our religion.
Sharon: O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.
Randy: Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.
Stan: Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
Stan: Aw, dude, why would they do that?
Cartman: Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
Kyle: No, dude. Spielberg changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.
Stan: Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
The Boys: Woohoo!
Announcer: In this version, the word "WOOKIE" has been changed to "HAIR CHALLENGED ANIMAL" and the entire cast has been digitally replaced by Ewoks.
Stan: Goddamnit, that pisses me off!
Kyle: Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
Tweek: Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.
Stan: Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
Kyle: Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.
Stan: We have to do something. Let's form a club.
Cartman: Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
Stan: No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
Kyle: Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club.
Cartman, Stan: Yeah.
Tweek: NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!
Tweek: I'm not! I'm not a team player!
Cartman: Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!
Cartman: Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!
Stan: Well what's wrong with it?
Kyle: "Free hat?"
Cartman: Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
Cartman: Well we can just make them out of paper.
Tweek: Aahh!
Cartman: It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
Tweek: You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??
Richard: Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center.
Cartman: How many hats have you made?
Tweek: Oh God!
Tweek: You guys, we have a big problem!
Stan: What?
Kyle: Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.
Cartman: They're gonna kick your ass, Tweek!
Tweek: Goohoo!
Crowd: Free hat! Free hat!
Tweek: I gotta move away, you guys!
Stan: Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
Crowd: Yeah! Yeah!
Skeeter: Eh- Excuse me?
Tweek: Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!
Tweek: You don't?
Stan: You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
Skeeter: Yeah. Free Hat.
Tweek: What?
Man: Hat McCullough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released!
Man 2: Yeah!
Crowd: Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Man: To do what?
Kyle: We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers...
Crowd: Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Skeeter: Can't we also work towards freeing Hat?
Stan: Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
Some people: Oh yeeaahhh!! Raaaaah!! Woohoo!!
Crowd: Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Stan: ...212, 213, 214 members!
Kyle: What?
Stan: Really? That's great.
Kyle: Yah.
Cartman: But just remember that I do all the talking.
Kyle: You?? Why?
Cartman: Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
Stan: When did we do dibs for it?
Kyle: Me.
Tweek: Ga-ahah!
Cartman: What could possibly go wrong?
Ted Koppel: A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCullough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCullough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?
Tweek: Gaaarh!
Ted Koppel: Well, Hat McCullough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free?
Ted Koppel: Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as "positive" about toddler murder?
Tweek: Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?
Kyle: We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
Tweek: Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!
Ted Koppel: Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response?
Steven Spielberg: Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers.
George Lucas: Hear hear.
Tweek: Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!
Steven Spielberg: And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children.
Cartman: Yeah, we're children.
Stan: Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
Cartman: Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
Ted Koppel: How so?
Cartman: Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
Steven Spielberg: You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ever did.
Man 3: And if we get a hold of the negative they can't change the movie?
Stan: That is our understanding.
Crowd: YEAH!
Skeeter: Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free!
Stan: It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
Man 4: Well yeah, but it was in self-defense!
Crowd: YEAH!
Cartman: He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
Skeeter: Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha.
Man 5: Three eyewitnesses testified that if Hat hadn't killed those babies, they'd have killed him!
Skeeter: He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat.
Stan: Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
Kyle: We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
Tweek: Hwaaah!
Tweek: Haaah!
Cartman: People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
Tweek: I'm in a field... surrounded by deer.
Kyle: That's it!
Cartman: Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!
Tweek: Huh uh.
Cartman: Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!
Tweek: Oh God! Oh Jesus!
George Lucas: We're gonna make it better. The movie's gonna be changed, and that's that!
Cartman: Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
Stan: Aw, really?
Stan: Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
Cartman: ...No, he has an icy heart.
Kyle: ...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, r-tard.
Stan: So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song.
Kyle: Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
Cartman: Oh, do we wanna do that?
George Lucas: ALRIGHT, that does it!
George Lucas: It is... too late for me, boys.
Kyle: You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
Kyle: When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society.
George Lucas: Have I... become so old that I've forgetten what being an artist is about?
Stan: Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
George Lucas: Steven, Uh, I-
Steven Spielberg: Give me that print, George! We need to make the alterations!
Kyle: What??
Guard 2: The one with the cocaine-problem escaped, mein Direktor.
Matt Stone: And now with new technology we can finally remaster South Park, make it look sharp, clean and focused.
Man 3: Prisoner? You mean, like Hat?
Woman: Hey, he's got a point there.
Tweek: No!
Skeeter: No?
Woman: Or is it freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?
Man 9: That's it!
Tweek: Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!
Tweek: Hello!
Cartman: Wow.
Tweek: Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
Cartman: AY!
Francis Ford Coppola: And if we refuse?
Tweek: Then your premiere has no movie!
Stan: He's definitely lost it.
Kyle: Yup.
Kyle: Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!
Members: In the tropical isles with the coconut trees, the air is fresh and the people are free.
Man 5: But here in the mountains there's no freedom like that.
Skeeter: There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. [the governor looks up a bit surprised]
Audience: Hooray! All right!
Tweek: Ah, what?!
Viewer 1: Wait a minute. This version is awful!
Viewer 2: Yeah! They ruined it!
George Lucas: AaaaAAAAA!!
Kyle: Yeah. I I think so.
Cartman: Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
Townsman: Yeah! Alright!
Townsfolk: Yeah! Woohoohoo!
Townsfolk: Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat!
Skeeter: Sure. Give that man a baby!
Tweek: Oh my God!
Stan: Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
Cartman: That and youth. Those guys are old.
Stan: Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
Liane: Oh, hello boys.
Stan: Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
Liane: Oh, but I thought your teacher died.
Kyle: She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
Tweek: Cartman likes to play with dolls?
Cartman: It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Cartman: Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
Polly Prissy Pants: Please, mister, let me out.
Cartman: It puts the lotion back in the basket!
Polly Prissy Pants: I miss my mom, mister. I wanna see my-
Liane: Sweetie.
Cartman: Yes, mom?
Liane: You have to get ready for school.
Liane: Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.
Liane: You'll get over it, honey.
Bebe: Hey guys.
Wendy: Hey Bebe.
Bebe: Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away.
Cartman: Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?
Stan: Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
Clyde: Hey Token. You know, I never really noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.
Token: I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with.
Cartman: Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
Craig: I don't know. Why?
Cartman: It just... It just seems like a really awesome shirt.
All the boys: Whoa.
Clyde: That is an awesome answer!
All the boys: Yeah!
Kyle: Dude! Bebe is really smart!
Stan: Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
Cartman: Yeah, may be.
Bebe: Yeah?
Stan: Uh, we're gonna go throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
Kyle: Yeah, it's cool.
Bebe: Well sure, that sounds hella fun.
The boys: Hahahahahaha...
Kyle: Yeah.
Stan: Hella fun.
Cartman: Right, heh.
Clyde: Wow, hella fun. That's awesome.
Token: I'm gonna start saying that now.
Driver: You damn kids!
Bebe: Cool.
Clyde: You try it, Bebe.
Bebe: Okay.
Driver: You damn kids!
The boys: Awesome!
Stan: Hoh hoh hoh!
Kyle: Hah hah hah!
Kyle: We were throwing rocks at cars.
The boys: Oh yeah.
Cartman: Woohoo.
Jimbo: You damn kids!
The boys: Hi, Bebe.
Bebe: Hey everybody.
Stan: Hey, that's what I wrote about!
Butters: Me too!
Mr. Mackey: Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Token, why don't you read your paper?
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, Bebe?
The boys: Wwooww.
Clyde: Chase his tail? That must be so funny!
Bebe: "Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."
The boys: Wwooww!
Cartman: God, you know what? That's so true. Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper?
Wendy: But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-
Kyle: Maybe she's in the lunch line.
The boys: Yeah.
Wendy: Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.
Millie: I can't stand her anymore! She's such a slut!
Esther: She's a total slut!
Red: You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.
Millie: I heard that she lifted her shirt to the boys at the bus stop.
Millie, Esther: Wwooww.
Bebe: ...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?
Wendy: Slut.
Mrs. Stevens: Bebe, is something the matter?
Bebe: But am I slutty just because I'm starting to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool.
Cartman: Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk.
Stan, Kyle: True.
Stan: Yeah.
Kyle: Yep.
Cartman: And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
Kyle: Right.
Stan: Uh huh.
Cartman: And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
Kyle: Yeah.
Stan: That would be best.
Cartman: Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
Kyle: Huh??
Stan: Kyle??
Kyle: Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
Cartman: And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
Stan: Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!
Cartman: Pleeeeease???
Stan: No!
Kyle: No way! Tweek's cool!
Stan: Yeah!
Cartman: Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?
Bebe: Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.
Stan: Sure thing, Bebe.
Wendy: What are you doing?!
Clyde: We're trying to get Bebe to run for class president.
Craig: Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you.
The Other Boys: Uh huh.
Clyde: What?
Clyde: Yeah!
Craig: Yeah!
Butters: Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?
Clyde: Yeah!
Butters: Yeah!
Craig: Sure is!
Butters: Uhyep!
Bradley: We're going to see our friend Bebe.
Francis: Bebe is everybody's friend.
Kevin: Yeah. God put Bebe on earth to enrich everyone's lives.
Kevin: Arf arf!
Timmy: Arf! Ah Timmah! Timmah-ar-argh!
Mrs. Stevens: Oh, hello, boys.
Kyle: Is Bebe home?
Mrs. Stevens: No, she's with one of her little friends. But she should be back shortly if you boys wanna wait.
Bradley: Who is she with?
Mrs. Stevens: I believe she is playing "Lambs" over at Eric Cartman's house.
Stan: Cartman's?
Bebe: Precious?
Cartman: Now you say, "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."
Bebe: It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Cartman: Heheh, yeah.
Polly Prissy Pants: Mister, please let me out of here.
Cartman: Now say it again, louder.
Cartman: Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!
Polly Prissy Pants: My parents have money, Mister. They'll give you whatever you want. Please!
Cartman: Now, just yell "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"
Bebe: Put the lotion in the basket!
Cartman: Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"
Bebe: Don't you hurt my fucking dog!
Kyle: What the hell are you doing?
Cartman: We're playing "Lambs."
Bebe: You guys, calm down!
Timmy: Timmih!
Bebe: This is insane!
Bebe: Stop it you guys, please!
Bebe: Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble!
Mrs. Stevens: Bebe, those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if you'll come out.
Stan: Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!
Mrs. Stevens: Looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers.
Bebe: Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?
Mrs. Stevens: Sweetie, you're just blossoming into a woman.
Bebe: But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters.
Stan: Hoh. Hoh?
Astronaut 1: Aah. We made it.
Astronaut 1: Oh my God. We've landed on Earth thousands of years in the future and apes have taken over!
Astronaut 2: I knew it! You blew it up, didn't you?!
Dr. Hallis: You?
Bebe: Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.
Dr. Hallis: Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age.
Bebe: Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?
Dr. Hallis: Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane.
Bebe: I think it's insane to want them bigger.
Dr. Hallis: Why do you... hate your breasts so?
Bebe: Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.
Dr. Hallis: Oh, come on now, that's just silly.
Bebe: Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want.
Dr. Hallis: Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it?
Bebe: No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.
Dr. Hallis: That may be true, but I'm afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl.
Bebe: Damnit!
Dr. Hallis: If, on the other hand, you'd like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm?
Sharon: Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?
Randy: Why? What's the matter with him?
Sharon: He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.
Randy: Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
Randy: Hey there, son.
Randy: Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan.
Stan: Ahta.
Randy: Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life.
Randy: But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.
Right Breast: The boys are at war. All is going as planned.
Left Breast: Yes. Soon all the boys will be brought to their knees.
Right Breast: We grow larger every day.
Left Breast: And stronger.
Left Breast: Sh! Sh! She's awake!
Right Breast: Ah, quiet.
Bebe: No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!
Bebe: That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!
Dr. Hallis: Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts?
Wendy: Yes! I want to get breast implants!
Mrs. Testaburger: I tried to tell her she was too young.
Dr. Hallis: Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant.
Dr. Hallis: Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty.
Mrs. Testaburger: I still don't know about this.
Dr. Hallis: Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars?
Mr. Mackey: M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades.
Token: Yeah. What the hell happened to us?
Stan: Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
Cartman: Bebe's boobs?
Bebe: Oh cool! It worked!
Stan: Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
Kyle: Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
Bebe: Yes!
Cartman: So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
Bebe: Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.
Kyle: But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
Stan: I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
Clyde: Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid!
Clyde: Let's never let boobs come between us again!
The Boys: Hear Hear!
Kyle: Boobs are stupid!
Clyde: Look at those ridiculous things!
Tweek: Gahahghah!
Tweek: Oh God. They're gonna get me.
Mrs. Tweak: You know never to talk to strangers, right Tweek? You can't trust anybody.
Mrs. Tweak: It's just a precaution, sweetie. Probably nothing will ever happen.
Tweek: ...Inside my room? Oh God!
Voice: Give it up, buddy! We've got ya surrounded! Okay, Tweek, I want you to very calmly but quickly walk to the door and come out to us!
Richard: You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and I?
Stan: I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.
Kyle: It will.
Kyle: So?
Tweek: So? I don't know him!
Cartman: Dude, relax.
Cartman: Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?
Driver: 'Scuse me, is this the right road to Breckenridge.
Driver: Please, I just need to know if this is "South Park"?
Elderly Lady: Could you help me across the street?
Tweek: Huh uh!
Man in Wheelchair: No, no, you don't understand. I'm, I'm paralyzed from the neck down. I push the chair with this device in front of my mouth, but it's it's not working, so you see-
Tweek: I'm not supposed to talk to you!
Man in Wheelchair: Please, this, this isn't funny, kid. You have to help me.
The Ghost of Human Kindness: You have never seen the likes of me before.
Tweek: What do you want?
The Ghost of Human Kindness: You have lost faith in humanity, lad. Something I cannot bear to see happen.
Tweek: Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.
The Ghost of Human Kindness: That is the world of the news reports. It is the world that adults preoccupy themselves with, but it is not the world as it is.
Tweek: It isn't?
The Ghost of Human Kindness: Are you starting to understand, boy?
Tweek: I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.
The Ghost of Human Kindness: That's right, lad. So do you think you can learn to trust people now?
Tweek: I'll... try.
Officer 1: Alright Johnson, give it up!
Tweek: What the hell is going on?
Mrs. Tweak: Tweek, Tweek, are you okay?
Richard: Did he hurt you, son?
Tweek: No.
Detective: Then we aren't too late. His name is Frederick Johnson. He's been abducting children by dressing up like the Ghost of Human Kindness for over a year now.
Liane: What's going on?
Sharon: A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy.
Steve: Oh my God, what are we gonna do?
Townsfolk: Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
Mayor McDaniels: People, people, calm down.
Randy: Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!
Townsfolk: Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
Mayor McDaniels: Yes, but standing out here yelling "Rabble rabble rabble" isn't going to help anything.
Jimbo: Well we don't know what else to do, Mayor!
Townsfolk: Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble.
Mayor McDaniels: People, what do you think we need to do?
Sheila: Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids.
Townsfolk: Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
Randy: Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.
Richard: That's... not a bad idea, a city wall.
Sheila: But who can we get to build it?
Mayor McDaniels: ...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city.
Tuong Lu Kim: I don' build wall. I just own un' operate City Wok.
Gerald: We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.
Sharon: Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim.
Randy: Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.
Randy: Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.
Stan: Child Tracker?
Sharon: It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.
Randy: If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.
Stan: ...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
Randy: You can barely even tell you have one on.
Stan: I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
Sharon: I wouldn't worry about that.
Cartman: So weak. So weak, dude. Man.
Kyle: Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
Tweek: I didn't mean to.
Randy: There is no other team.
Stan: Huh?
Richard: Well, we've... put a wall around the city to keep outsiders out. You don't think we want a bunch of strangers coming in to play ball, do you?
Stan: But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
Townsfolk: Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows!
Kyle: Dude, we weren't playing anybody.
Randy: Yeah, and you kicked ass!
Roger: Isn't it awesome havin' a great wall around our city? Nobody in town except for our good friends.
Townsfolk: Yeahah! Alright! Yeah. Right on! Right on!
Sharon: Turn it up.
Chris: Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak.
Tom: Sure does, Tom.
Sharon: Stanley, time for us to get back to the house.
Stan: Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.
Richard: 'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here.
Sharon: Right. Do what you normally would do.
Cartman: At least I'm not a stupid Jew.
Sheila: What what whaaat?
Stephen: Us? Your family's always been the shifty-eyed ones!
Mr. Mackey's Father: We just wanna make sure nobody hurts you, Junior, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey: M'kay.
Richard: Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey!
Richard: Where are you going?
Mrs. Tweak: Uh. I'm just going to go upstairs and see if Tweek is still in his bed.
Mrs. Tweak: It's okay. I can do it.
Richard: I just want to make sure that you-
Mrs. Tweak: That I don't abduct him? How do I know that you haven't done it already?
Richard: Me? I would never abduct our son!
Mrs. Tweak: That's not what the new study says!
Stan: But why do I have to leave?
Randy: The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.
Linda: Be careful out there!
Stan: Where are we supposed to go?
Stan: Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
Tuong Lu Kim: Hahahahahaaa! I'm free, Mongolians! And now I'm gonna make you PAY!
Sharon: Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay.
Sharon: Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town off to live on their own?
Randy: Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.
Leader: Tah tane da ke ab kahleh kalabush.
Cartman: Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.
Tweek: Triben fak burushban.
All: Shain balag!
Randy: What's going on?
Liane: I heard an explosion.
Man in Back: Mongolians?
Randy: What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!
Adults: Rabble rabble rabble rabble!
Sheila: Ike? Kyle?
Richard: Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are.
Roger: Kids? Don't you remember us?
Randy: Bi kute.
Roger: We are your parents. You used to live here, with us.
Kyle: Yeah, it was like four days ago!
Richard: They're starting to remember.
Stan: Uh huh, Stan Marsh.
Richard: We're sorry, Tweek!
Roger: Are you okay, Clyde?
Butters: Huh, I'm over here, Dad.
Sheila: We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.
Richard: Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along.
Roger: You mean how he said we should trust each other, or how he abducted children?
Richard: The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did.
Adults: Wow, yeah. Oh yeah.
Adults: Whoa! Wow. Right!
Stephen: Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah.
Tuong Lu Kim: Aw, you'd better not say what I think you're gonna say.
Mayor McDaniels: Mr. Lu Kim, tear down this wall!
Tuong Lu Kim: Oh, God! I hate this whole shitty!
Sharon: Randy, can we just take our son home now?
Stan: We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
Lolly: Oh that's great!
Cartman: You bet your fat clown ass it is!
Lolly: Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket stub.
Stan: Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
Kyle: It was such a long time ago!
Cartman: Wu-we don't really "need" the ticket stub, do we?
Lolly: Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you high?? How else do I know you're the winners?
Stan: Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
Stan: We've gotta find that ticket!
Kyle: Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
Stan: Where's Kenny??
Stuart: Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?
Carol: His body? Well, why??
Cartman: Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
Kyle: Yeah. Closure.
Stuart: We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him.
Cartman: You turned him into a teapot?
Stuart: No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it.
Cartman: Wewewewewewe...
Robot Guard: Wewewewewewe...
Kyle: Alright, we made it!
Stan: Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
Kyle: Is he in there?
Cartman: What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
Stan: It was a trick!
Cartman: God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
Stan: Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
Kyle: Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
Cartman: Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
Stan: Cartman, come on!
Stan: Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
Cartman: How?
Randy: Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.
Randy: A ladder to heaven? Why, son?
Randy: That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard.
Randy: The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven.
Jimbo: Awwww.
Mr. Garrison: A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid.
Stan: O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
Cartman: Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
Kyle: That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
Stan: You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
Randy: Yeah, whatever.
Cartman: It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
Kyle: But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
Sharon: Oooh, you're a little frisky, aren't you?
Stan: How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
Stan: Good job, wizard.
Cartman: And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.
Kyle: I'm a Paladin, Cartman!
Cartman: Jews can't be Paladins.
Sharon: Hey there, cowboy.
Sharon: Mm, yeah baby.
Sharon: Ready.
Narrator: [the video begins. Randy massages Sharon's arm] The story begins in ages past, in the deep regions of Middle-earth, where Scorn first thrived in the kingdom of Gelgelar.
Randy: Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.
Narrator: Seven rings were cast and given to the races of Men.
Narrator: Seven, to the races of Elves, five to the gloondock villagers of Gelgendor. [Sharon takes a good look at the video]
Sharon: But then that mean..?
Randy: The boys have the hottest porno ever made.
Stephen: Oh, hello boys.
Stephen: Well, thank you very much, kind heroes.
Cartman: Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
Cartman: Man, that's crap.
Linda: Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?
Butters: Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!
Evan Stone: [softly] Spank that ass. [a few seconds later, a spanking is heard]
Randy: Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
Cartman: And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
Kyle: Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
Stan: We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
Sharon: Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now.
Cartman: This sounds like a really important quest.
Stan: Woww.
Cartman: This... is so cool.
Woman: ...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm...
Kyle: Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
Butters: Well, then... then let me go with you.
Cartman: And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
Stan: Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
Kyle: Oh, crap, the sixth graders!
Sixth Grader 1: Whatcha got there?
Sixth Graders 2 and 3: Whoa!
Stan: Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
Kyle: You can't keep it.
Sixth Grader 1: And what are three little fourth graders gonna do about it, huh?!
Cartman: Yeah!
Sixth Grader 1: Oh man, I can't wait to see this!
Stephen: Oh, hello, Randy, Sharon.
Randy: Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?
Sharon: Oh, dear!
Stephen: What's the matter?
Stephen: Butters?
Stephen: Butters, where is the movie you were watching?
Randy: The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.
Kyle: We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
Stan: Oh crap, dude!
Kyle: Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
Stan: Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
Sheila: Oh God, this, this is horrible!
Gerald, Stephen: Backdoor Sluts 9?!?
Linda: Is that bad?
Sharon: We're sorry.
Liane: Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film.
Sheila: Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!
Randy: It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?
Clyde: What do you guys want?
Stan: We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
Clyde: So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.
Cartman: We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
Clyde: Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble.
Cartman: Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.
Cartman: Clyde's a dick.
Other Sixth Graders: Ooooooh!
Other Sixth Graders: Ahhhhh!
Other Boys: Ahhh.
Jimmy: That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f-...forces.
Craig: It could hold a mental spell of some kind.
Clyde: Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody.
Stan: But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
Clyde: That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black.
Kyle: This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
Stan: What do we do with it?
Clyde: One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. It must be returned to the video store from whence it came.
Jimmy: Well, where is the videotape rented from?
Tweek: Conifer? Walking there would take hours!
Craig: There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!
Kindergartner: I'll go.
Craig: You're too young.
Cartman: Quiet!
Jimmy: You guys, this is stupid.
Cartman: You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
Tweek: Me too.
Craig: Only the six of us are to go?
Stan: No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
Kyle: We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
Cartman: A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
Stan: True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
Token's Father: Oh. Hello everybody.
Gerald: Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago.
Token's Mother: Well yes, I believe they were, but they've gone. What's the matter?
Randy: We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape.
Steve: Jesus, what kind of porno is that?
Sheila: Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid.
Gerald: Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?
Craig: We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close.
Stan: Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
Kindergartner: Ringworms are no match for a dwarf.
Boy 1: I shall put a magic spell on you!
Boy 2: I have blocked your spell, wizard!
Boy 3: We're playing Harry Potter.
Cartman: It's Butters.
Kyle: Butters?
Butters: The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
Cartman: Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
Jimmy: Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?
Kyle: Jimmy, are you sure?
Stan: Jimmy didn't stop them!
Cartman: Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
Craig: What? That's stupid.
Cartman: I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!
Cartman: Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
Sixth Grader 1: What the hell is wrong with you guys?! Get the tape!
Sixth Grader 4: Dude, I don't wanna get wet.
Sixth Grader 5: Yeah, I don't really like the water.
Sixth Grader 2: Besides, if our bikes get wet, their chains'll rust.
Stan: Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
Kyle: Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
Stan: This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
Kyle: Oh brother!
Butters: The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
Stan: Where?!
Butters: First, just let Butters sseee the precious.
Kyle: No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
Cartman: If that was possible.
Stan: Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
Sheila: This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!
Gerald: Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context.
Jimmy: They're taking it to the vi... the vi... the vii...
Stephen: Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time.
Jimmy: They took it back to the video s... the video s...
Randy: The video sandwich?
Stephen: The video stockyard.
Randy: What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?
Jimmy: No, the video suh... the video s...tih...
Gerald: Stinger?
Stephen: Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?
Jimmy: N-n-no, you retards! The video s...tore!
Sheila: Hurry! Hurry!
Kyle: Oh no! They're closed!
Stan: Closed?
Cartman: We're screwed.
Kyle: Butters! No!
Stan: They're coming!
Butters: It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
Sixth Grader 2: Aw man, now we'll never see the hot action.
Sixth Grader 1: You stupid little fourth graders!
Cartman: The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
Kyle: Middle-earth is again safe.
Sixth Grader 1: Yeah? Well, that's not gonna stop us from kicking your asses!
Stan: Uh-oh.
Randy: Boys! Boys!
Cartman: And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
Randy: There you are!
Sheila: Oh, Kyle! You're safe!
Stan: Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
Sharon: See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it.
Sheila: That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle.
Gerald: Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.
Randy: That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
Randy: Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.
Randy: Well, let's all get going.
Principal Victoria: I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.
Mr. Garrison: Wow, that's... really great to hear.
Principal Victoria: As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job.
Principal Victoria: We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that.
Principal Victoria: With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.
Principal Victoria: Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.
Mr. Garrison: ...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly?
Kyle: Funny.
Kids: AWWWW!!!
Kyle: Not him!
Mr. Garrison: Thank you, Mr. Mackey.
Butters: Where is Mr. Hat, sir?
Mr. Garrison: Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.
Mr. Slave: Ugh.
Cartman: No, it was Kenny!
The Other Kids: Yeah.
Gerald: I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.
Linda: Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.
Gerald: So full of metaphor.
Sheila: Oh, hi boys.
Sharon: How was school?
Kyle: Uhh, not cool.
Sheila: That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?
Stephen: Uh huh.
Kyle: Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
Sheila: Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!
Stan: Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.
Stan: Yeah, but Dad-
Randy: No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!
Cartman: Ey!
Tour Guide: That's right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don't we, kids?
Tour Guide: That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like "All Asians are good at math" is harmful to society.
Cartman: Ey!
Tour Guide: You other boys have probably called this young man names like "tubby," or "lardbutt," or "fat tits,"...
Kyle: "Fat tits." That's a good one.
Stan: Yeah, I have to remember that.
Tour Guide: And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.
Tour Guide: Well, that's the end of our tour.
Randy: Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?
Stan: I guess.
Smoker: Oh I was just uh-
Tour Guide: There's no smoking in the museum!
Smoker: But I'm not in the museum.
Gerald: Yeah, dirty lungs!
Sharon: Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath!
Stephen: Dumbass!
Tour Guide: Well, have a great day, everybody.
Stephen: Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?
The Boys: Yeah.
Butters: It evaporates.
Mr. Slave: AAH.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?
Chef: Hello there, children!
The Boys: Hey Chef.
Chef: How's it goin'?
Kyle: Bad.
Chef: Why bad?
Chef: ...Intolerant of who?
Kyle: Gays, I guess.
Stan: Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around them.
Kyle: Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
Chef: Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!
Stan: Are we homophobes now?
Chef: Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??
Stan: N-no?
Chef: You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.
Cartman: I'll take three lunches today, please.
Chef: You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!
Mr. Garrison: You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
Principal Victoria: Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat.
Principal Victoria: Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods.
Principal Victoria: No no no we're not firing you.
Mr. Garrison: ...You're not?
Principal Victoria: No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar.
Principal Victoria: You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class?
Chef: He IS a sick queer!!
Mr. Garrison: Yeah!
Principal Victoria: I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef.
Mr. Mackey: Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay?
Stan: We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
Randy: Well I really thought you boys learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!
Stephen: Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!
Butters: Yes sir.
Stephen: Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn.
Mr. Mackey: Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay?
Sharon: That sounds good to me.
Liane: Me too.
Sheila: Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp.
Stan: Tolerance camp?
Mr. Garrison: God-damnit!
Mr. Slave: How'd it go?
Mr. Garrison: This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!
Mr. Slave: The principal didn't fire you?
Mr. Garrison: No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!
Mr. Slave: Oh, Jesus Christ.
Mr. Garrison: I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!
Kyle: Uh, a bear?
Camp Warden: Ein bear?! Und bear has nothing to do with accepting people of different races!
Mr. Garrison: There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet?
Mr. Garrison: What's the matter?
Mr. Slave: Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess.
Blonde Nurse: What have we got?
Liane: Is he going to be okay?
Liane: Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?
Dr. Doctor: I'm afraid he's... running out of time.
Dr. Doctor: It's his time. It's ...running out.
Liane: Well, what does he need?
Dr. Doctor: He needs to have more time.
Liane: What can we do?
Cartman: Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!
Chef: Hello there, children.
Stan: Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
Kyle: Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
Chef: Well what's wrong with him?
Stan: Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
Kyle: Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
Chef: Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
Kyle: Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?
Chef: Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!
Liane: He's looking a little better today.
Chef: Cartman?
Stan: No, that's Kenny.
Stan: That's Cartman.
Cartman: Oh, about a month.
Dr. Doctor: Let's not validate his delusions.
Chef: Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?
Cartman: He's gone again.
Chef: Ms. Cartman, we need to get Eric to a medium who can speak with people who have crossed over.
Dr. Doctor: What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant!
Chef: This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.
Stan: Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
Chef: That's right. We have to go see him in New York.
Dr. Doctor: I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's time could give out at any minute. He needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored.
Chef: Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.
Kyle: We're going to New York?
Flight Attendant: Welcome aboard Flight 673 to New York. We are happy to show you a feature film during the flight. In a moment we'll be showing a preview.
Stan: Awesome!
Chef: This must be the place.
Chef: Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you.
Man 1: Mary was my mother!
John Edward: Okay okay, and she-she's she died?
Man 1: M-mm-m. Not really.
John Edward: Must be from somewhere else in the audience, then. Uh, d'uh, money? Is someone el-
Stan: Uh, over here please?
Kyle: We have a dead friend.
John Edward: Uh d'eh'hm quiet, quiet down boys. It doesn't work that way. Uh, okay, I I'm getting ...someone now whose name is g-, a t-. It's an l-, it's a m-, it's k-.
Cartman: Kenny!
John Edward: Kenny says hi.
John Edward: Okay, now I'm getting that Kenny ...died?
Stan: We told you that.
Kyle: Yee-yeah.
Chef: Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?
John Edward: Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle?
John Edward: Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma?
John Edward: She says there was something she asked you to do, and you're not doing it? She wants you to look for four white doves.
Kyle: Oh my God!
John Edward: Oh now she's sending me a P word. Maybe it's a puh-? Or a huh-?
Woman 1: My Harry died last year!
Stan: Heh hey wait a minute dude.
John Edward: Okay now Harry. He's telling me... oh well, he's saying that you two used to... do things.
John Edward: And that those things involved... stuff?
Chef: Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!
Stan: He seemed better on TV?
Chef: Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.
Chef: We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.
Stan: We don't get to go to Scotland?
Liane: It's too far and your parents want you back home.
Cartman: Thanks, asshole.
Chef: Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now.
Announcer: This is the final boarding announcement for Flight 342 to Denver.
Kyle: Four white birds!
Stan: Huh?
Stan: Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
Kyle: So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
Kyle: I'm not going back.
Stan: Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
Butler: He doesn't do private readings.
Stan: I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
Stan: Jesus Christ.
John Edward: Thank you, thank you.
Stan: Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
Stan: Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
John Edward: Look, people have the right to be skeptical. I really hear voices in my head.
Stan: Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
John Edward: Look, what I do doesn't hurt anybody. I give people closure and help them cope with life.
Stan: No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
John Edward: But I'm a psychic.
Stan: No dude, you're a douche.
John Edward: I'm not a douche! What if I really believe that dead people talk to me?
John Edward: I think I've had of your bullying me! Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs, lock myself in my panic room and call the police!
Stan: I'm nine years old.
Cartman: Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
Liane: Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon.
Pilot: Welcome aboard Scotland Air. Our trip to Edinburgh should take about twelve hours.
Cartman: Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!
Pilot: In the meantime we'd like to show you a complimentary film.
Rob Schneider: I'm a carrot!
Rob Schneider: Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
Stan: Kyle! Kyle!
Kyle: Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!
Stan: Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
Kyle: He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
Stan: Kyle, you can't run your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
Stan: No, he's not.
Construction Worker: John Edward? Oh yeah, I heard he walked up to a guy on the street, and said his dead father wanted to say "Happy Birthday," and it WAS his birthday.
Woman 3: Yeah kid, how do you explain that?
Stan: Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
Woman 4: Okay.
Stan: Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
Woman 4: My father?
Stan: Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
Stan: Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"
Woman 4: Oh my God.
Man 2: Well then how'd you know her birthday was in November?
Stan: Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He's saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money."
Woman 3: That's amazing.
Stan: No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
Man 3: That sounds a little too coincidental.
Man 4: Yes. There's only one explanation. This kid can communicate with the dead!
Adults: Wow!
Man 2: Do me next. I wanna talk to my mother.
Woman 3: Can you try to reach my grandfather.
Stan: No wait.
Man 5: Yeah, help me out too, 'k?
Man 6: I'm next. I'm next.
Man 7: Hey, get out of my way!
Man 8: Do me!
Scout: Kid, how would you like your own talking to the dead show?
Chef: Hi Pop.
Thomas: Junior! Aw, son, it's good to see you now.
Nelle: Oh, my baby come home!
Nelle: Lord, I thought you wasn't comin' till nine.
Chef: Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman.
Liane: Please, call me Liane.
Nelle: So nice to have you here, Liane.
Thomas: And is this the children you told us about?
Chef: Yeah, Pop. This is Eric.
Liane: Oh dear.
Thomas: Nelle, you best have at it now.
Thomas: Alright, children, stand up on this chair now.
Cartman: Right now?
Cartman: Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.
Nelle: Come out now. Come out now.
Chef: Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing.
Stan: No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"
Woman 6: Oh wow!
Man 10: Amazing!
Woman 7: Ask Peter if he knows my little Billy.
Thomas: In the name of all that is holy we demand this spirit be set free!
Thomas: There we go! We're gettin' somethin' now!
Nelle: Come on out, spirit. Go!
Chef: The victim child?
Nelle: Oh Lord, they didn't bring a victim child.
Chef: Where were we gonna find a child to sacrifice?
Thomas: God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go!
Nelle: Lord, Thomas, don't let it get on the curtains.
Stan: Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
Kyle: You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
John Edward: So, you think you can talk to dead people better than me, huh?!
Stan: I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
Stan: Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
John Edward: I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to the world that I'm psychic and you're not!
Nelle: I'll open a window, you try to chase it out, Thomas.
Thomas: Go on now, soul now!
Thomas: Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!
Nelle: I'm just tryin' to persuade it.
Thomas: Over here!
Liane: Get it down.
Thomas: Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.
Chef: What do we do with it now?
Liane: Oh, baby, your time is back!
Stan: No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
John Edward: Wah-why?
Stan: Yeah.
Stan: There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
Man 11: What the?
John Edward: Why that... that's me!
Stan: No, it can't be.
John Edward: What?!
Stan: Now do you people believe me?
Man 12: Well I don't know. How did Edward know my father died in March?
Cartman: God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
Liane: Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie.
Chef: Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast?
Cartman: It's still at baggage claim!
Lion-head Alien: This year's nominees are...
John Edward: I'm not a douche!
Stan: So throw it away.
Clyde: Nobody wants to touch it.
Kyle: What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say?
Craig: Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?
Clyde: And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?
Stan: You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.
Kyle: ...Where did you have sex with her?
Ozzy: You kids fucking don't fuck around with your fucking mom!
Jack: Dad, we fucking can't! It's a big flick a fuck!
Stan: Aw, come on, Mom.
Stan: It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
Grandpa Marvin: Oh goody. Now we can watch the news.
Sharon: Who are you?
Naked Man: Dad!
Randy: Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
Stan: I'm me from the past?
Future Stan: Your name's Randy Marsh, you're a geologist, and you don't like chicken. Mom, your maiden name is Kimble and you have a scar on your left knee from when you slipped in the swimming pool.
Future Stan: Dude, just let me talk to you for like, five minutes. After that I'll bail.
Future Stan: I can still remember when I was five and you both found that squirrel I'd been keeping in the closet and, you let me keep it for another week and then it ran away but... I know that's just what you told me. I know that Mom had actually let it out.
Randy: How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
Sharon: But why are you back in this time with us, son?
Stan: Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
Future Stan: Thanks. Can I get another beer?
Sharon: You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?
Future Stan: That'd be killer. Where can I crash?
Sharon: Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind sharing his room, would you, Stan?
Kyle Schwartz: Ah-a-a-alright, I'm done.
Cartman: You're done?
Kyle Schwartz: Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice.
Cartman: Yeah, so how's it look?
Kyle Schwartz: It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good.
Cartman: But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
Cartman: What?!
Kyle Schwartz: Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad.
Kyle Schwartz: Yes, wa-a-I didn't think "hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot" really counted as nice.
Cartman: It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
Kyle Schwartz: Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you.
Cartman: Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
Kyle Schwartz: But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?
Kyle Schwartz: Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth.
Cartman: Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
Kyle Schwartz: If you cured cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents.
Cartman: Jesus Christ!
Mayor McDaniels: Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays!
Cartman: I'm just letting you guys know how special you are to me.
Townsfolk: YEAH! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!
Cartman: Oh my God, that's it!
Kyle: What's it?
Jimmy: Wow, what a terrific audience. Thank you for giving me this great honor, Mayor. B-before I l, l.. light the tree, I was wondering if I could sing... my favorite ...Christmas song, real quick.
Mayor McDaniels: Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks?
Townsfolk: Christmas songs! Christmas songs! Christmas songs!
Stan: Cartman, why are you doing this?
Kyle: That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
Mr. Hankey: Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'?
Kyle: Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
Cartman: The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
Cartman: Really?
Stan, Kyle: Really?
Mr. Hankey: Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away!
Kyle: But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
Cartman: Wow!
Mr. Hankey: Next stop, the North Pole!
Kyle: Me neither.
Mr. Hankey: Poo Choo Train's layin' down its tracks with a
Whistle: Poo Choo!
Mr. Hankey: All the way and back!
Cartman: Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
Kyle: Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
Stan: I don't know.
Jimmy: ...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear t...t...tree. On the third day of C...Chrihhh...Chriiii...
Kyle: Finally!
Stan: God, it took forever!
Cartman: Wow, is that where Santa lives?
Gnome 1: Mr. Hankey!
Mr. Hankey: We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business.
Gnome 1: Sure thing!
Kyle: Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?
Mr. Hankey: Howdy ho, Santa!
Mr. Hankey: All ready for Christmas?
Santa: I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.
Cartman: Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?
Santa: Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end.
Mr. Hankey: Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric.
Santa: You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.
Cartman: That's what I thought.
Mr. Hankey: All right!
Santa: And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.
Cartman: Hooray!
Jimmy: ...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear tree. On the ...fourth day of C...C...Ca...Chriiiistmas my t-true love g-ge-gave to me-mee...
Gnome 1: This is Santa's flight control center. From here, we can monitor Santa from satellite as he travels the globe delivering presents.
Kyle: Wow, cool!
Gnome 1: Sleigh is going down! I repeat! Sleigh is going down!
Gnome 5: Jesus Christ, they killed him!
Stan: Why would Iraqis do that? Why?
Mr. Hankey: It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them.
Mr. Hankey: Santa! Are you alright?
Gnome 2: What is your status?
Stan: Oh no.
Cartman: Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
Cartman: It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.
Stan: Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
Cartman: Oh, Christ.
Mr. Hankey: Hey, that's right. Jesus can save anybody.
Gnome 2: We fed Jesus Christ's data into the autopilot. This sleigh should be able to take you right to him.
Stan: I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
Cartman: Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!
Mr. Hankey: Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time!
Kyle: Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
Gnome 2: You just have to call out the reindeer's names.
Cartman: Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-
Cartman: Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!
Mr. Hankey: We should be able to find Jesus in no time!
Cartman: I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
Kyle: What are you doing?
Kyle: Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
Kyle: All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
Cartman: [resumes his position in back of the sleigh and speeds up his song] It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...
Jimmy: Six geese are laying... fu...five go-oldenh ...uhrings. Fodom... dom... du...du...t...du... Four calling biiirds...
Iraqi General: They say that the Chinese were the first to experiment with an electroshock to the testicles.
Iraqi General: What else is America planning?!
Iraqi General: You're not in a position to kill anyone, my main man! I just want you to tell me America's plan!
Cartman: Jesus!
Jesus: Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children?
Stan: Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
Jesus: Santa? Is he alright?
Kyle: We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
Jesus: We have to get him out of there.
Mr. Hankey: Do you know a way?
Jimmy: On the s...seventh day of Christmas my t...true love...
Gnome: Red Sleigh 2, come in.
Stan: We're here.
Gnome: You're coming up on the source of the signal. You're right on top of him!
Jesus: He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey.
Jesus: Yay, look upon me, and know me.
Soldier 1: Halak balah!
Soldier 2: Kli malah!
Cartman: This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
Jimmy: On the el- el- el- eleventh day of C- Christmas my t...true love gave to me, e-eleven p-p-pipers p-pu-p-piping...
Iraqi General: Ach!
Mr. Hankey: More soldiers are coming!
Jesus: Let's move. Move!
Jimmy: Eight... maids are... milking...
Santa: We sure did, Jesus.
Jesus: Uh Santa?
Stan: Oh my God. Iraqis killed Jesus.
Mr. Hankey: Start the sleigh!
Stan: Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
Cartman: Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
Kyle: Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
Cartman: Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
Mr. Hankey: What are you doin', Santa?
Stan: RPG, four o'clock!
Mr. Hankey: Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy now!
Santa: Merry Christmas! Hohoho!
Santa: Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!
Jimbo: Oh, finally!
Townsfolk: Awwww!
Randy: Stan!
Sheila: Kyle!
Mr. Hankey: I'll help you, Santa!
Cartman: Oh, God-damnit!
Kyle: Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
Kenny: (Hey guys. What's goin' on?)
Stan: Oh, hey Kenny.
Kyle: Dude, where have you been?
Kenny: (Oh, I've just been hanging out.)
Stan: Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
The Boys: School days, school days, teacher's golden rule day...
Kyle: Ah, damn it!
Cartman: What?
Kyle: My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
Ike: Suck my balls.
Cartman: Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
Kyle: Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
Ike: Don't kick the goddamn baby!
Kyle: Kick it!
Kyle: Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Cartman: That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
Kyle: Really? What about?
Stan: Dude! Visitors!
Kyle: Totally!
Cartman: What?
Stan: That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
Cartman: What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
Kyle: Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
Cartman: Eh... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.
Stan: No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
Cartman: No I don't remember that!
Kyle: You don't?
Cartman: No, because the aliens erased my memory!
Stan: What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
Chef: Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles
All: and a choice of green bean salad or vegetable medley.
Kyle: Weird
Chef: Say, did any of you children
All: see the alien space ship last night?
Chef: What the?
Stan: Chef, we're in a repeat.
Chef: A repeat??
Kyle: Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
Cartman: Aw dude, I hate repeats!
Stan: It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
Chef: We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.
Kyle: What is a proc-tologist, Chef?
Chef: He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.
Stan: You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.
Chef: That's right.
Kyle: What a dick!
Chef: Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.
Proctologist: What seems to be the problem?
Chef: We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.
Kyle: Other than his monstrous size.
Cartman: What?
Stan: Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
Cartman: Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Chef: Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.
Kyle: And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
Cartman: Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Oww.
Proctologist: Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...
Cartman: Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.
Kyle: Are you okay?
Chef: Well, doctor?
Stan: You all right?
Cartman: You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
Proctologist: I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way.
Stan: Where to now, Chef?
Chef: And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff.
Jeff: How do we uh, make it come out?
Chef: Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.
Stan: What?
Cartman: Nope! It has to be Kyle!
Stan: Go on.
Kyle: I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
Chef: Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.
Kyle: God-damnit Cartman!
Kyle: Stop it Cartman!
Kyle: God Dammit!
Chef: Eric, that's enough!
Stan: Oh, nice going, Cartman!
Cartman: All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
Kyle: No!
Cartman: No, go ahead. I'm dry.
Kyle: You're lying!
Chef: It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!
Cartman: But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
Chef: Okay. Now it's funny again.
Cartman: This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
Chef: What's it doing?
Kyle: It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
Cartman: Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
Kyle: We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
Stan: We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
Jeff: Whoever they are, if they're receiving messages, they might be sending them, too. Wait a minute. c-candy bars.
Kyle: Candy bars?
Stan: What do we do???
Chef: Help!
Stan: Let's go!
Visitor Driver: Coop coop.
Stan: It's the police!
Cartman: When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
The Boys: Chef! Chef! They've got us!
The Boys: Cheeeeeeef!
Stan: We're in the alien ship.
Kyle: It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
Stan: My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
Kyle: Yeah.
Kenny: (Awesome)
Stan: Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
Alien: Hello boys.
Stan: Dad?
Alien: No, not really. I just read your mind and thought this form might be more pleasing to you.
Kyle: Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.
Cartman: Aw God, that movie pissed me off.
Stan: Okay okay, take the form of something else!
Cartman: Santa!
Alien: Dy-no-mite!
The Boys: No!
Jeff: Oh no!
Chef: Did you find out what the aliens were up to?
Chef: They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!
Chef: Butt sex?
Chef: Who's havin' butt sex?
Alien: [prances as Saddam] Hello my honey, hello my baby, hello my ragtime gal! [ends on his knees, arms wide open]
The Boys: NO!
Stan: I like it.
Stan: You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?
Alien: That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning.
Kyle: Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
Kyle: Earth?
Stan: Our planet is just a reality-TV show?
Alien: Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun!
Alien: Why?
Stan: Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
Announcer: This jannemon at eight o'clock, it's everyone's favorite show! Earth! It's been one hundred Gelganighs since we first took species from seventeen different planets and put them all together, on the same planet! Oo-derp! They've fought and fallen in love! What will happen this Galgamog? Tune in jannemon at eight to find out. It's... Earth! On Fognl!
Jeff: I'm afraid that Earth, a-all of Earth, is nothing but an intergalactic reality-TV show.
Jeff: Waaaait, you don't understand!
Kyle: What?? Who cancelled us?
Stan: Oh shit, did we do that?
Staff: Awww.
Nagix: Wouldn't do any good.
Kyle: Dude, we have to try!
Stan: Please, take us to them! Please!
Chef: What the hell is that?!
Chef: Chaos theory??
Chef: Huh?
Chef: Oh my God! We have to stop them!
Receptionist: Can I help you?
Stan: Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
Receptionist: Where are you visiting from?
Stan: Uh, Earth?
Joozian 2: We took a hundred beings from the planet Marklar and put them on an asteroid with sentient beings from the Horsehead Nebula. It-it's a riot!
Joozian 1: They hate each other!
Kyle: Mighty powerful network executives
Joozian 1: Oooo, I'm starving! You Earthlings have haglar yet?
Joozian 2: Oh yeah, let's do haglar.
Joozian 1: Where do you wanna go? Meroni's?
Joozian 2: Not on a Flakmar. Too crowded. Ohhh, Blackafelch!
Joozian 1: Oh, Blackafelch. Perfect.
Joozian 2: This place is fantastic!
Stan: Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.
Kyle: Please don't cancel us. Please.
Joozian 1: Oh I'm sorry, Earthlings, but you have to realize the universe is a business.
Joozian 2: You've made it to a hundred episodes, you should be proud!
Joozian 1: Yeah, a show should never go past a hundred episodes, or else it starts to get stale with ridiculously stupid plotlines and settings.
Kyle: Oh my God, this is great!
Joozian 1: You must have some Joozian ancestry.
Stan: Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.
Joozian 1: Oh my God! Would you look at the heglars on that joozinek?
Stan: Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!
Joozian 1: Let's take the Earthlings to a hekmubah!
Joozian 2: Oh, yeah!
Joozian 1: Oh yeah, let's see those heglars!
Stan: Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-
Joozian 1: Meeh, screw this place! Let's go get a hotel room and a hooker!
Joozian 2: Oh yeah!
Chef: We have to find a way to stop those aliens!
Jeff: If people don't wear jackets they could get cold. A cold is caused by a virus. A viru- a computer virus! We could make a computer virus and send it to their ships to disable their computers!
Joozian 2: Ogh.
Joozian 1: Oh yeah!
Joozian 2: Good.
Joozian 2: Woohoohoo! Yeah!
Joozian 2: Yeah, suck my jagon!
Joozian 1: Oh man, I can't believe I sucked your jagon.
Cartman: No.
Joozian 1: Oooo, I knew that was coming.
Joozian 2: They really got us by the nezmins.
Kyle: The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
Stan: I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
Cartman: There's even World War Three to look forward to.
Kyle: And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
Joozian 1: He-all right, all right Earthlings! Ya, you win! The show can stay on.
The Boys: All right!
Joozian 1: Just be sure to keep up the wars and violence.
Kyle: Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Cartman: That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
Kyle: What the hell is that?
Kenny: (I don't know.)
Cartman: What is it, Chef?
Butters: Hey Jimmy.
Jimmy: Butters, w-where is everybody?
Jimmy: Christopher Reeve? Christopher Reeve?!
Butters: You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.
Cartman: We didn't go to your comedy show.
Jimmy: Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do!
Kyle: Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
Stan: Yeah dude, not cool.
Stan: Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
Timmy: Ha-a-aaa-haaa-a.
Timmy: Timmeh!!
Jimmy: Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much.
Timmy: Rrruh Timmeh!
Cartman: Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.
Jimmy: Hey there fellas.
Stan: Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
Timmy: Timmih!!
Kyle: What?
Jimmy: Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join.
Cartman: Can too!
Cartman: Oh God-damnit!!
Kyle: Cartman, just stay out of it.
Cartman: But they say I can't be in their club!!
McGillicuddy: Hello, boys. What can I do for you?
McGillicuddy: Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna wear these shirts
Jimmy: Why not?
McGillicuddy: Well, because there already is a group that calls themselves the Crips, and I don't think they'd like it too much.
McGillicuddy: Well, sure, they're all over at Five Points area in Denver. You've never heard of them?
Jimmy: No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?
Jimmy: Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it.
Jimmy: Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.
King: My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve, who, with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms.
Reeve: Thanks for having me on again, Larry.
King: And how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells, Chris?
Bum: You are?
Jimmy: Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.
Large Crip: Is they for real, manh?
Braided Crip: The only Crips is born Crips, dawg.
Tall Crip: Yeah, you can't become a Crip by accident, fool!
Jimmy: Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group?
Buff Crip: All right, you wanna thug with the Five Point Crips? Bitches, all you gotta do is pop some punk-ass Bloods.
Jimmy: Well, sure. Tim and I would love to pop some punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific at it.
Timmy: Timmih?
Timmy: Uh-tu-Timmih!
Buff Crip: So you sayin' yuh down?
Jimmy: Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?
Timmy: Timmih!
Officer: Hey you kids.
Officer: What the hell do you think you're doin'?
Jimmy: We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods.
Jimmy: Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver!
Buff Crip: Yo yo, listen up y'all! Let me tell you about my little Gs, Roller and 4 Legs here. They just smoked thirteen Bloods in one night!
Crip 1: One night?
Crip 2: You're kiddin'? You're kiddin'? One night?
Buff Crip: That ain't never been done before!
58 Crip: And they got us marshmallows and ginger ale.
Jimmy: So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?
Timmy: Timmih!
Jimmy: Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time.
Cipac: Alrighty. Keep it real, dawg.
Jimmy: Well, that sure was a terrific time. Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy.
Jimmy: Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops?
Pops: Jimmy, your mother was gettin' worried about you.
Reporter: Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news. Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand.
Crowd: Uugh.
Kyle: Yup. I'm not seeing anything.
Jimmy: Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung... Pao Chicken, please.
Mr. Kim: I don't want no trouble! You just... take what you want and leave!
Timmy: Timmih!
Timmy: Timmih!
Jimmy: What's that? Oh, and one medium lemonade, please.
Timmy: Timmih.
Mr. Kim: You take! Uh one hundred twelve dorrar!
Jimmy: Ah- are you sure?
Mr. Kim: I no want no trouble. Just take it and leave!
Mr. Kim: Here! Here two order of Kung Pao Chicken, and small ice tea!
Jimmy: Actually, it was a regular lemonade.
Jimmy: Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time.
Pops: Jimmy? Jimmy, could you come into the kitchen please?
Jimmy: A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg.
Ryan: Jimmy, those people you're hanging out with are no good.
Jimmy: Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends.
Mamsie: And what about your standup comedy, Jim, huh? Are you just giving up on that, too?
Ryan: Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God made you the way he did for a reason!
Jimmy: Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.
Ryan: That's right. You were sent here through the vengeful and angry hand of God to teach your mother and I a lesson. And that's a big responsibility, son.
Reeve: Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again.
Reeve: Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you?
Hackman: I'm good. You?
Hackman: Christopher, I've come to ask you to stop what you're doing?
Hackman: Using stem cells is like playing God. You should leave nature alone.
Reeve: And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?
Hackman: I'm saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards you're dealt, Christopher.
Hyde: We're Detectives Hyde and Richardson from the Special Gang unit in Denver.
Jimmy: Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer?
Richardson: Word on the street is it was a retaliation hit by the Bloods.
Jimmy: The... B-Bloods?
Hyde: You know, smart-mouth! Your rival gang! The Bloods are at war with the Crips, they kill each other all the time!
Jimmy: The-they do??
Richardson: Don't act like you don't know, you lil' punk! The Crips and Bloods hate each other, and if you stay in that gang, you're gonna end up dead too.
Jimmy: But... but why do they hate each other?
Hyde: Look kid, I used to be a Crip myself, but I'm not anymore!
Jimmy: Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?
Jimmy: Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to s-stop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.
Timmy: Timmih!!
Jimmy: You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.
Timmy: Timmih!!
Jimmy: This is gonna be t-terrific!
Randy: Oh, what a fighter.
Gerald: That brave, brave man.
Liane: He's an inspiration to us all.
Reporter: Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength.
Hackman: You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop using stem cells.
Reeve: Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?!
Reporter: Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies, has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research. If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't know what is.
Hackman: They're affecting your mind, Chris. If you won't stop using stem cells, then we'll stop you!
Reporter: Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now.
Jimmy: We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by.
Mr. Appleby: Just remember to make sure the kids play safe in the pool area.
Mr. Appleby: I'll be back at seven to let you out. You kids have a good time.
Buff Crip: The Bloods!
Blood 1: Oh shit! It's a trap!
Blood 2: Muthafuckin Crips tryin' to smoke us all out!
Jimmy: It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles.
Timmy: Timmih!
Dr. Doom: Uhhh, how about domination of the world?
Saddam Hussein: Yeah. Or uh, death to the infidels?
Reeve: Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission.
Professor Chaos: Oh boy, General Disarray, may- maybe we just oughtta stay outta this one.
Hackman: We just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research. Your fetus-sucking days are over!
Hackman: And now we're going to put you somewhere where you can never touch another fetus again!
Buff Crip: You stupid mofos are dead!
Blood 3: Make the first shot, punk!
Jimmy: Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers.
Jimmy: Look, we have the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?
58 Crip: You talkin' crazy, dawg.
Blood 5: Yeah, we ain't playin', sucka!
Buff Crip: Wait a minute. What did you say?
Blood 6: Yeah. Come on.
Crip 2: Yeah, that's right. Come on.
Jimmy: Come on.
Someone: Come on.
Buff Crip: I've gotta give you two dawgs props for puttin' an end to all this hate.
Jimmy: I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger.
Blood: Right on!
Reeve: You haven't seen the last of me, Hack Man! I will be back!!
Stan: Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
Kyle: Me too.
Kyle: A reindeer?
Stan: Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.
Stan: See?
Cartman: You can't do that!
Teacher: I certainly can! I'm your teacher!
Teacher: Make it two hours!
Stan: Mrs. Streibel thinks she's so cool!
Kyle: How dare she talk to us like that?!
Kenny: (Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)
Stan: Like what?
Cartman: Like find out where Mrs. Streibel lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Kyle: TP her house?
Cartman: Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
Kyle: Oh.
Teacher: Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime, you're being punished!
Stan: D'you think that's enough?
Cartman: Should be fine.
Kyle: Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
Cashier: Hello boys. Find everything you need?
Cartman: Yep. All set.
Cartman: Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
Stan: Okay
Cartman: Heh yeah, that that's right.
Kyle: You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?
Cartman: No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
Stan: Is this the right house?
Kyle: Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.
Cartman: So?
Kyle: So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
Stan: Kyle, we all agreed to do this!
Kyle: We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
Kenny: (Yeah! Fuck you!)
Kyle: We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
Cartman: Who cares??
Kyle: Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
Stan: Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
Mrs. Streibel: AAAAAAAAA!
Mr. Streibel: Honey, what is it?? Oh, Jesus no! Our house!
Butters: Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streibel's house got covered with toilet paper.
Clyde: Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
Cartman: Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streibel probably had it comin' to her.
Mr. Garrison: Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.
Kyle: Oh God!
Kyle: How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
Cartman: Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
Stan: We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
Cartman: Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
Kyle: I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality
Stan: Yes, dude!
Cartman: Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
Kyle: Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...
Stan: Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.
Mr. Mackey: We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please?
Kenny: (Me??)
Cartman: Touch, Mr. Mackey, touch.
Kyle: Why are they doing us one at a time?
Cartman: They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
Cartman: Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
Mr. Streibel: Ah... look, we really don't wanna make a big deal out of this.
Mr. Streibel: Look it's just not that big a deal, I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself when I was a kid.
Officer Barbrady: You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!
Mr. Streibel: I was here.
Officer Barbrady: Aha!! Got you!
Mr. Streibel: Officer, why would I TP my own house?
Officer Barbrady: Insurance?
Mr. Streibel: It wasn't me, okay? Now, if you don't mind, I just wanna get my yard back to normal.
Mr. Streibel: You really have nothing better to do, do you?
Officer Barbrady: No I do not.
Mrs. Streibel: AAAAAAAAA!
Mr. Streibel: Oh, Jesus no! Our house!
Kyle: I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
Cartman: Is there anything else I can get for you?
Kyle: Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
Officer Barbrady: I just need to talk to someone who knows how toilet paperers think.
Officer Barbrady: Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police.
Officer Barbrady: I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?
Josh: And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?
Officer Barbrady: Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?
Officer Barbrady: You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.
Officer Barbrady: Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know.
Officer Barbrady: So you think there was more than one. Why?
Stan: What about him?
Cartman: Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
Kenny: (I think so too.)
Cartman: Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
Stan: So what should we do?
Cartman: We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Cartman: Why not?
Stan: Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?
Cashier: You wanted to see me, Officer Barbrady?
Mr. Bell: Oh my God.
Officer Barbrady: Is this toilet paper from your store?
Mr. Bell: It's... difficult to tell, it's... so decayed, I... wait a minute, yes. Yes, I recognize the floral pattern now.
Mr. Bell: Who would... do this to toilet paper? Who?
Officer Barbrady: Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?
Mr. Bell: Suspicious like how?
Officer Barbrady: Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern.
Kyle: What's this all about, Cartman?
Cartman: I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
Kyle: A boat ride?
Cartman: I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
Kyle: Well, okay.
Kyle: Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
Cartman: And you feel like you have to confess.
Kyle: Cartman!
Officer Barbrady: Josh, I need your help.
Josh: The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it.
Officer Barbrady: How do you mean?
Josh: Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?
Officer Barbrady: Yes.
Josh: Single-sheet?
Josh: Why does one toilet-paper houses
Officer Barbrady: To get revenge.
Josh: No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation.
Officer Barbrady: What do you mean?
Josh: Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man?
Officer Barbrady: I don't have time for this, kid.
Josh: Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool house?
Josh: Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art.
Officer Barbrady: Oh. Of course! One of her students!
Stan: Cartman, what are you doing?
Cartman: I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
Stan: You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
Cartman: They did?
Kyle: They did?
Stan: They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
Kyle: Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
Cartman: But can I still kill Kyyyle?
South Park Police Department, day. The boys head for the station and enter.: Dialog
Officer Barbrady: Hello boys. How are you?
Stan: We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
Officer Barbrady: It sure is!
Cartman: Uh, can we see them-him-her?
Butters: Hey fellas!
Stan: Butters?
Butters: Yep. I'm in jail.
Kyle: You con-fessed?
!Officer Barbrady: His parents are on their way down now.
Butters: Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
Cartman: What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
Kyle: Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.
Officer Barbrady: Why do you say that?
Kyle: Because it was-
Butters: You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
Officer Barbrady: All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.
Cartman: You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
Kyle: I still feel bad, Cartman
Cartman: What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
Kyle: Yeah. That makes it even worse.
Cartman: Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
Kyle: I know.
Cartman: So... so then, how can you feel bad?
Stan: He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
Cartman: ...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
Kenny: (Yeah, maybe we should.)
Kyle: We feel bad for other people.
Cartman: Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!
Butters: Hi, Dad.
Stephen: Don't you "Hi, Dad" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!
Butters: Yeah.
Linda: What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!
Officer Barbrady: Huh??
Stephen: Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady.
Linda: Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!
Butters: Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
Stephen: And that's your excuse?!
Stephen: Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!
Cartman: It's over this way! Come on!
Cartman: So how are things, guys?
Stan: Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
Cartman: I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
Kyle: You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
Mr. Mackey: Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know-
Principal Victoria: All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?
Josh: What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?
Officer Barbrady: Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?
Kyle: We have to confess that we were the ones that-
Mr. Mackey: It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything.
Stan: You, you do? How?
Kyle: Cartman??
Cartman: I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
Principal Victoria: Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.
Cartman: My consciences just caught up with me.
Kyle: That's not fair!
Mr. Mackey: You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave.
Kyle: But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
Policeman Brown: He... He was too fast for me. He ran out the door!
Officer Barbrady: Couldn't you have gone after him?
Mr. Mackey: Welcome to detention. You will be here till five o'clock, so make good study use of your time. M'kay?
Stan: Wugh! Two weeks of this!
Kyle: Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
Cartman: I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
Cartman: I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
Cartman: Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
Kyle: Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
Cartman: Hm.
Officer Barbrady: Police station.
Officer Barbrady: Josh? Josh, where are you?!
Josh: I'm afraid that giving away my location might be harmful to my freedom, officer. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get out of that dingy cell.
Officer Barbrady: Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children, let's take our seats. Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?
Mr. Garrison: Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problem.
The Boys: We got out of schoo-l! No more school toda-ay!
Kyle: What should we do?
Tom: Right. What about the war?
Tom: Uh huh, and what aspect of it do you think is most gay?
Mr. Mackey: Don't you call us un-American! This country was founded on the right to protest! M'kay?
Protesters: Yeah! Right!
Stuart: If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!
Supporters: Yeah! Right!
Randy: The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
Skeeter: Foundin' Fathers would kick all your asses!
Tom: Boys, what do you think the Founding Fathers would say?
Butters: Mmuh well, not really, no.
Mr. Garrison: Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!
Class: Awwwwww!
Cartman: But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
Cartman: Maaaa. M-maaaa.
Cartman: I'm trying to have a flashback.
Kenny: (A what?)
Stan: No, you just have to study.
Kyle: That isn't gonna work, dumbass!
Mr. Slave: Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me.
Randy: How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!
Protesters: Hahahaha, yeah.
Jimbo: You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side of the town!
Protester: Hey wait a minute, your side of town has the post office.
Stuart: Well your side has the grocery store.
Jimbo: Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.
Gerald: Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?
Jimbo: W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.
Townsfolk: Yup, yes sir, yeah, right, uh huh.
Skeeter: Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.
Stan: How?!
Kyle: Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
Cartman: Benjamin Franklin?
Kyle: No, turdpants, it's Kyle!
Townsfolk: Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Mayor McDaniels: Okay, people. What are we rambling about now?
Gerald: There was no war months ago!
Skeeter: Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!
Randy: Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music propaganda!
Mr. Mackey: Well up yours, rednecks!
Townsfolk: Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Mayor McDaniels: Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have to give the town square to both groups.
Jimbo: All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!
Randy: Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!
Skeeter: We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle!
Gerald: Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!
Stan: Cartman?
Cartman: Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
Stan: Oh no...
Cartman: Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Founding Fathers!
Kyle: Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
Cartman: I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
Stan: Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
TV OH: Your Tivo is full.
Stan: Aww crap.
Driver: Worthy young lad, are you all right?
Cartman: Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
Driver: This year? Why it's 1776, it is.
Cartman: Oho yes! I did it I did it!
Driver: Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's house to get a very important document, I am.
Driver: Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?
Cartman: No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
Driver: A flashback? Why, what is that?
Dr. Doctor: Your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion I've never seen before. His chances of surviving are very slim. I'm so sorry.
Liane: Whoa. Easy, Kyle.
Kyle: But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
Stan: I guess we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!
Liane: I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!
Driver: Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.
Cartman: But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
Driver: Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson
Jefferson: Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.
Cartman: And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
Jefferson: Some favor going to war with England and others want to avoid war at all cost.
Cartman: It's a bitch, ain't it?
Stan: Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-
Kyle: Oh, Jesus...
Randy: Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.
Stan: Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.
Mr. Mackey: Hey... That's a terrific idea!
Gerald: Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!
Stan: Oh, no, nononono.
Skeeter: See? I told you they had your son.
Stuart: Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?!
Kenny: (I'm doing my homework.)
Stan: Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-
Kenny: (But Dad, I-)
Stuart: NOW!
Skeeter: Yeah!
Randy: Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.
Gerald: Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!
Protester 1: Yeah, that's right!
Protester 2: Come on, guys!
Protester 3: Get back to work!
Kyle: Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
Cartman: Wow.
Hancock: Mr. John Adams?
A Congressman: Excuse me, but does this Declaration actually suggest that we should go to go war with England?
Mr. Mackey: And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war.
Skeeter: Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first!
Jimbo: Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!
Randy: Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!
Randy: Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!
Skeeter: I'm a little for supportin' our troops.
Randy: And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.
Skeeter: I believe freedom isn't free.
Randy: No, but war shouldn't be our goal.
Skeeter: We must defend our country.
Somebody: Yeehaw!
Adams: We must go to war!
Dickinson: But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy.
Congressman 1: England will only understand one thing: Force.
Tom: Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in.
Protesters: Booooo!!
Stan: Uh, we didn't do it.
Mr. Mackey: What?
Kyle: We didn't do our homework.
Sharon: Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!
Stan: Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Daylight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-
Skeeter: That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war!
Mr. Mackey: The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!
Supporters: Support!
Protesters: Protest!
Supporters: Country!
Protesters: Rock-n-roll!
Congressmen: Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!
Dickinson: We cannot found a country based on war!
Adams: We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!
Congressman: Rabble!
Cartman: Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
Hancock: Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue?
Franklin: I believe that if we are to form a new country, we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a country that appears to want both?
Jefferson: Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time.
Dickinson: Right. If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it.
Franklin: And that means that as a nation, we could go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the country will be forever blameless.
Congressman 2: Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying one thing and doing another.
Hancock: And we will call that country the United States of America.
Cartman: Wow!
Townsman: The-the child! The child, from the hospital.
Cartman: If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
Kyle: He does?
Cartman: You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too."
Randy: He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.
Skeeter: Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President.
Mr. Mackey: I guess we... owe you an apology.
Kyle: Cartman? Cartman saved the day?
Stan: Can't be
Cartman: The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
Skeeter: Hey I'm a little bit country
Skeeter: I'll be the muscle of America
Randy: And me, I'll be the caring soul.
Kyle: Cool.
Kids: Jennifer Lopez?
Kyle: No way.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: My name is Hennifer Lopez. I eat tacos, y burritos.
Cartman: Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh si, si. But first I would like to put on my pretty dress.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh si si si. I like it very much.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Saright.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: It better be! I am Hennifer Lopez!
Cartman: Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez.
Cartman: Nono, Jeh-
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Heh-
Cartman: Jeh-
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Heh-
Cartman: Jeh
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Jeh
Cartman: Jennifer Lopez.
A Council Member: Hahahahaha, oh my.
Cartman: Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Don't be fooled by all my money. I still like to eat tacos, honey. So crispy on the outside, so super good and yummy.
Cartman: Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
Kyle: It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
Cartman: Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
Kyle: No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Aww, that makes me muy triste.
Cartman: Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh si si, very much.
Cartman: Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
Cartman: Is nice?
Cartman: Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Mmm, tacos! So yummy!
Kyle: Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
Cartman: Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
Kenny: (Heheehee, heheh yeahah)
Kyle: Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
Cartman: I agree. Those places are stupid.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: It's not stupid. I need to make music video.
Cartman: Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
Cashier: Welcome to Make Your Own Video. All set to rock and roll?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: How much to make a video?
Cashier: Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape.
Cartman: Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh please! Come on, guys!
Kyle: Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!
Kyle: That's not what I meant!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Something hot and spicy.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Spicier.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Spicierrr!
Cashier: You know, I've seen a lot of videos here at the mall, and that was by far the best!
Cashier: Hey, I've got a friend who's interning at a big record label in L.A. I'll send a copy on to him and maybe he'll get the bigwigs to see it.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh, gracias, Machel, gracias!
Kyle: Can we go now, please?!
Cartman: Yeah, I wanna leave.
Kyle: Stop it, Cartman!
Cartman: What?
BHI President: Yeah, but she's younger and spicier.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco.
Aide 2: I don't think J-Lo would like it very much if we signed this new girl.
BHI President: No, you're right. We're gonna have to fire J-Lo.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh, si si siiih. Allo!
Cartman: What do they want?
Cartman: S'awright?
Cartman: What? What?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh my God I can't believe it!!!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: They want to sign me to the record company!
Cartman: You want to sign Ms. Lopez?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh my God, it's happening for me!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: We're gonna be famose!
Cartman: There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh, si si siiih.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Ohh, I'm so sleeeepyyy.
Man 1: Ms. Lopez! Up here!
Man 2: Jennifer, We love you Jennifer!
Man 3: Jennifer, over here.
Man 4: Jennifer!
BHI President: Ah, Ms. Lopez, come on in.
BHI President: Yes, well uh, Ms. Lopez, we regret to inform you that, uh... we're dropping you from the label.
Jennifer Lopez: What? Oh no you di'n't!
Aide 1: We wanna thank you for all your hard work and ..."talent".
BHI President: Wu-well a very talented younger singer has come to our attention and, and the truth of the matter is her name happens to be Jennifer Lopez as well. And we really can't have two here at BHI Records.
Aide 1: Well, she lives in South Park, Colorado now, but uh I believe she originally from Mexico, just like you.
Jennifer Lopez: I don't come from no Mexico! I'm Puer'ah Rican!
BHI President: Whatever. Look, it's nothing personal, we just think you need to move on.
Aide 2: Bu- AND you're a mean-spirited bitch who spits on people who aren't rich and famous.
Reporter: And sources say that the new film will star Ben Affleck.
Jennifer Lopez: Take me to South Park, Colorado! I'm gonna kill that bitch!!
Stan: What are you gloating about?
Cartman: Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to record an album next week.
Kids in Class: Wow, really?
Kyle: No!
Mr. Garrison: Okay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals.
Mr. Garrison: Butters, will you pay attention, please?
Butters: Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez!
Cartman: Jennifer Lopez?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Yes?
Butters: Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too!
Mr. Slave: Oh Jesus, will you look at those boots?
Principal Victoria: Is it true? Jennifer Lopez is here?
Mr. Mackey: Here she comes! Here she comes!
Jennifer Lopez: Okay! What smart-mouthed little punk-ass bitch has been saying they're the new Jennifer Lopez, huh?!
Cartman: Not me!
Jennifer Lopez: What the hell is that?!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: My name is Hennifer Hlopez! And I like tacos, and burritos.
Jennifer Lopez: That? That's what replaced me?!
Cartman: I'm sure it was just a mistake.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Only mistake was when this ghetto trash got signed in the first place!
Cartman: Shut your God-damned mouth!
Cartman: Nobody!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: I am Yennifer Hrlopez! I eat tacos, and burritos!
Cartman: Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
Jennifer Lopez: You'd better stop!
Cartman: I will!
Bebe: Wow, Ben Affleck.
Jennifer Lopez: Don' you forget what'll happen to you, ho! Come on, Benny!
Kyle: Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
Cartman: Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
Kyle: Good.
Kyle: Aw, God-dammit!
Cartman: Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Ohsisisi, senor.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh, where are you going, Kyle? Come give me kisses!
BHI President: Gentlemen, we have ourselves a hit.
Cartman: What the hell are you doing?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: I'm practicing my dancinngg!
Cartman: Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Dancing!
Cartman: Sleep!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Dancing!
Liane: What's the matter, sweetie?
Cartman: Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!
Ben: Hey, I was wondering if I could talk to Ms. Lopez.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Ben!!! Oh, you brought me roses!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: I can't stop thinking about you either, Ben!
Ben: I've been meaning to write a song or a poem, but I have no talent.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: I know, my darleeeng. That's okay.
Ben: Will you just take a ride with me in my awesome car?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh Ben, I would LOVE to!
Cartman: NO!
Cartman: I'm not going out in his car.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: I'm not gonna let you blow this one chance I have.
Cartman: I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Okay, Ben, let's go!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh Ben, I am soo happy! The cool breeze blowing through my hair in your sexy automobile.
Ben: Let's spend the whole day together!
Ben: Jenny, I have to tell you something. I... I think I love you.
Ben: But what?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: But what if you still have feelings for the slut with the large ass?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh Ben. Beennn.
Ben: Jenny, can I kiss you?
Ben: Mmm, just like tacos.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Taco-flavored kisses for my Ben.
Ben: You're so hot, baby.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: I make you hot, Ben?
Ben: Oh God, Jenny!
Ben: But I love her!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Ben!
Ben: Jenny! Jenny, I'll call you!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: I love you, Ben!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: [the band stops playing] What the hell is wrong with you?! You cholos can't even keep a beat! I deserve better than thees! I an Hennifer Lopez! Where is my water?! [a page brings "her" a bottle of water. "Jennifer Lopez" knocks it onto the floor] Not Evian, Pellegrino, you stupid beetch!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Ooo baby baby, can I have your tacos?
Aide 2: Uh, that's fine Ms. Lopez. Look, it's been a long night. Why don't we pick it up in the morning?
Cartman: Aww crap.
Cartman: OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
Dr. Doctor: Your son's hand has a hairline fracture and two dislocated fingers.
Liane: Oh dear.
Dr. Doctor: But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh, hello guys.
Kyle: Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh, Kyle, why you no like meee?
Cartman: Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
Liane: Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.
Cartman: Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Buenos dias, my love.
Ben: Good morning, baby.
Cartman: You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: He's not going anywhere! Ben and I were up all night making love.
Ben: Should we tell him the news?
Cartman: What news?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: I think we should tell him.
Ben: It's S'aright?
Cartman: S'aright.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: S'aright.
Ben: We're getting married!!
Cartman: Oh, balls!
Stan: What's the matter?
Cartman: I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
Kyle: So stop doing it!
Cartman: Stop doing what?
Kyle: You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Don't you dare ever do that to me again!
Kyle: Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand doesn't need to breathe!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: You try being in an oven mitt for two hours!
Kyle: I can see your lips moving!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: I can see your lips moving too, culo!
Kyle: See?! I just saw your lips move!
Cartman: Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
Stan: What's she doing?
Cartman: Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Oh no you don't!
Cartman: Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
Ben: Don't you hurt her!
BHI President: We'll sue you!
Kyle: Oh Jesus.
Police Officer 2: All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath.
Ben: Our love is like rain!
Jennifer Lopez: That's what you said about me, asshole!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez: Quiet!
BHI President: Get her out of here!
Jennifer Lopez: Fuck you!
Police Officer 2: Shut up, picante pants!
BHI President: You're not?
Police Officer 2: Who's Mitch Connor?
Mitch Connor: Just your run of the mill con man. I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen. But I'm tired of runnin'.
Mitch Connor: I've been a cheat all my life. And now I've ruined a singer's career, lost a record company millions, and cost this little boy his precious time.
Kyle: Stop. It.
Cartman: I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
Manager: Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people.
Jennifer Lopez: Get a what with who?
Manager: Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?
Coworker: Yeah. Meee too.
Cartman: Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
Chris: Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now.
Kyle: Awww, shit!
Kyle: Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a great idea.
Mrs. Farnickle: Oh, hello there boys.
Stan: Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need solved, for a dollar?
Mrs. Farnickle: Ohh, neighborhood detectives, huh? Well let me thi-oh yes! There is something!
Kyle: Really?
Cartman: My God...
Stan: Have you reported this to any other authorities?
Mrs. Farnickle: Noo, but I think it's a perfect case for you kids.
Kyle: Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
Stan: We're on the case.
Cartman: What have you got, Marsh?
Kyle: I think we can piece this case together now.
Mrs. Farnickle: My pie tin! Oooh, but what happened to the pie?
Kyle: Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
Mr. Farnickle: Well, what do you think happened, little detectives?
Stan: His plan was to use a hammer.
Cartman: And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
Mrs. Farnickle: Oh my God, what kind of television have you kids been watching??
Stan: Just the news.
Mrs. Farnickle: All right, all right, you you boys run along now.
Kyle: We're in business!
Cartman: Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington.
Girl: Is this the South Park Crime Unit?
Stan: Yes it is!
Girl: I lost my dolly.
Kyle: Do you know where your doll is?
Girl: If I knew where it was, it wouldn't be lost.
Cartman: Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.
Cartman: No sign of forced entry.
Kyle: Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
Cartman: We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room.
The Boy: Agent Tucker, FBI! And you?
Stan: Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
Tucker: ...Not anymore, you're not!
Cartman: Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
Tucker: Can't we? You guys are playing Detectives. We're playing FBI. That gives us jurisdiction over you!
Stan: Aw crap!
Kyle: Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
Tucker: Good. Then you can help us by telling me everything you know.
Stan: Son of a bitch stupid FBI!
Cartman: Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.
Stan: No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that little girl's doll before those FBI guys do.
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Kyle: Yeah, but how?
Stan: We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
Cartman: Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
Butters: Ah, I was at home.
Cartman: You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!
Kenny: (Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)
Cartman: You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
Kenny: (Aww, it's okay, little fella.)
Butters: Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
Butters: How do I do that?
Cartman: You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
Butters: Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
Cartman: Stop playing games!
Butters: I'm not playing. I really don't know!
Cartman: I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
Stan: It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
Cartman: Really?
Kyle: Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
Butters: No!
Cartman: Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
Butters: My wiener??
Butters: Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
Cartman: Well pull harder!
Butters: ...ow... Ow... It's not workin'.
Cartman: Try doin' it faster.
Cartman: Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
Butters: NOOooo!
Cartman: The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
Butters: Okay!!
Butters: ...ow... Ow!
Fosse: Huh huh who is it?!
Stan: South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
Kyle: What do we do now?
Stan: I don't know.
Stan: Dude, we just can't tell on them.
Cartman: Why not?
Kyle: Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
Bill: Yeah.
Fosse: We were playing gynecologists and now we're playing criminals.
Bill: That's gay.
Fosse: We're gay.
Stan: Jesus! They're gonna kill her!
Kyle: We've got to do something.
Cartman: Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
Cartman: Yeah! This was our hot lead!
Stan: We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
Tucker: No you're not.
Cartman: Dammit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
Tucker: Climb off, kid! We say you can't charge the front door, and you have to obey what the FBI says! That's the rules!
Stan: Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
Kenny: (What do we do now?)
Stan: We go get the doll ourselves.
Kyle: But they said we can't charge the front door.
Tucker: Come on guys. You don't wanna hurt that doll.
Fosse: No you didn't!
Stan: Did so!
Fosse: No, 'cause I got... special wizard armor on.
Kyle: We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, ass-face!
Stan: Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?
Cartman: We got her back safe. Lost a lot of good men in the process.
Dawson: Hello there little crime stoppers, I'm Lieutenant Dawson with the Park County Police. I heard you did a great job finding Sarah Peterson's doll.
Stan: We do what we can, sir.
Dawson: That means you boys are now an official part of the department.
Cartman: Kewl!
Dawson: All right, so ready for your first assignment?
Stan: Sure.
Dawson: Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567 Mala Vista. The operators are probably armed to the hilt with illegal weapons. I want you to get down there and see what you can find!
Kyle: Ah... a a a meth lab?
Kyle: What is a meth lab, anyway?
Stan: Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?
Man 1: You die, pigs!
Man 3: You won't take us alive!
Man 5: So long, coppers!
Stan: Damn.
Dawson: One UPS vehicle valued at twenty-five thousand dollars, one civilian vehicle worth sixteen thousand, the second floor of the post office AND a coffee shop valued at sixty thousand! The mayor's gonna have my ass!
Stan: Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
Dawson: You got careless! Now, I don't know how they do things down at that dog-and-pony show they call the Fourth Grade, but here we have rules! Jesus, we don't even have guys to question now, because you killed them all!
Kyle: We're sorry.
Dawson: One more slip-up like that and I'll have your badges! You hear me?! Now hit the showers!
Officer 2: Hey Murphy, think they'll let me borrow their G.I. Joes?
Officer 4: Come on, you guys. Leave them alone.
Cartman: Uh bonus?
Murphy: LOOK, we all work hard! And we deserve more than the thirty-thousand a year we get paid! So what if we take in a little on the side?
Officer 2: Yeah! Who the hell are you to change that?!
Hopkins: I said, back off Murphy!
Officer 2: That's right. Come on, bring it!
Officer 3: Yeah, let's go! Come on, bring it!
Dawson: What the hell is the problem here??
Murphy: No problem, sir. No problem at all.
Dawson: Then hit the showers, all of you!
Kyle: Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.
Cartman: Me neither.
Stan: It'll get better, guys.
Kyle: Better how, dude?
Stan: I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
Stan: You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. I'll see you guys at school tomorrow.
Liane: Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.
Cartman: We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
Liane: Well you should've called Mommy.
Liane: Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?
Butters: Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!
Butters: Yes?
Cartman: Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
Butters: Well I'm tryin', but nothing's comin' out.
Cartman: Well, keep tryin', Butters.
Kyle: Uh we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison: Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!
Dawson: Looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg. They found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado.
Cartman: Uh oh...
Kyle: Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
Murphy: So, what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant?
Stan: Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.
Murphy: Maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our... bonus money.
Officer 2: They're lying.
Murphy: They're dead!
Kyle: Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
Stan: No thanks.
DJ: Well all right, guests, put your hands together. Be sure to tip the dancers. And now, come on, let's hear it for Candy!
Kyle: Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.
Owner: All right, so we'll have to start havin' the McCormicks make our meth again and-
Bouncer: Hey Gino, these kids say they know you.
Gino: What? Ha-I don't know no kids.
Bouncer: I didn't think so. All right, you kids-
Gino: Hey wait a minute. These kids might be just what we need to get our drugs past the security at DIA. How would you like to join our family?
Tall Goon: Yo Gino, I know I've seen these kids before, man. These kids are 5-0!
Gino: What?
Kenny: (Pakew! Pakew!)
Gino: Detective Murphy! Jenkins! Uh what the hell are you doing? We had a deal.
Jenkins: Now we've gotta kill you all.
DJ: Huh alright guys, put your hands together, a lot of shootin' and killin' goin' on, but be sure to tip your waitress let's hear it for Rebecca.
Lead FBI agent: Get me a hard line to the phone! And I want choppers on the roof!
Dawson: Hey, I'm in charge of this investigation.
Fields: Not anymore, you're not.
Dawson: But that's not fair!
Jenkins: Sorry, Detective Hopkins. We can't let anybody know about our partnership.
Gino: That's right. We split it all, fifty-fifty!
Jenkins: Huhuh yeah. Sorry, Gino, but in business like this, sometimes partnerships need to end.
Stan: Thanks.
Stan: ...I think I have a better idea.
Kyle: Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.
Kyle: Certainly.
Cartman: You did?
Butters: Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
Kyle: That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
Cartman: Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
Stan: Wow, dude.
Cartman: Man, Indians have it good, huh?
Randy: Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.
Native American Chief: Welcome to the Three Feathers Casino. I'm your host, Chief Runs With Premise. Please try your luck at one of our many games.
Cartman: I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!
Runs With Premise: You kids can enjoy our Native American Comedy Club.
Randy: All right, time to win some money!
Gerald: Oh yeah! blackjack table!
Blackjack Dealer: Welcome to the blackjack table. May luck run through you, like the spirit of the buffalo.
Sheila: Gerald, this is ten dollars a hand!
Sheila: Well I don't wanna play here!
Sharon: Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.
Gerald: All right, time to show these people how to gamble!
Kyle: What is Native American comedy, anyway?
Audience: Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
Randy: How's it goin', Gerald?
Randy: Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.
Gerald: Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand.
Randy: Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??
Gerald: I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.
Randy: Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!
Gerald: Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!
Randy: Where did you get that kind of money??
Gerald: The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.
Blackjack Dealer: Thank you for playing at Three Feathers. May your life be filled with the song of the sparrow.
Sheila: There's daddy!
Sheila: Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.
Kyle: Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.
Kyle: I said I wanna leave.
Kyle: What?? No, no, I mean, I-
Gerald: No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!
Sheila: Gerald, what are you talking about?
Randy: He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.
Sharon: What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?
Runs with Premise: Look at them! Small-minded idiots pouring their life-savings away!
Elder 1: Their cash flows out of them like diarrhea from the buffalo.
Aide 1: And what do we do about the small town of South Park that lies in the highway's way?
Elders: Ha ha ha ha!
Mayor McDaniels: And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway.
Mayor McDaniels: The Native Americans have purchased the land out from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership.
Mayor McDaniels: The Native Americans bought the bank.
Mr. Garrison: Oh my God.
Mayor McDaniels: Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes.
Randy: How much do we have to raise, Mayor?
Butters: How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
Cartman: Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
The boys: Yeah!
Alex: Yeah, this is our town!
Stan: We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
Kyle, Butters, Tweek: Yeah!
Cartman: That's right!
Butters: Yeah, ahh, that's right!
Alex: Yeah, we're a team!
Stan: We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
Kyle: Dog parade?
Kyle: How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
Butters: Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.
Stan: Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!
Cartman: Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
Sheila: Oh, Gerald, I, I can't watch!
Runs with Premise: We're sorry. But if we do not build a superhighway, our casino might stop seeing profits.
Randy: There's more to life than profits!
Runs with Premise: Well like what?
Chris: Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well.
Stan: Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
Stan: No!
Randy: Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.
Stan: I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
Sheila: Boys, that's ridiculous.
Stan: Look, we- we've got nothing to lose.
Chef: What do you guys think?
Jimbo: It's a long shot.
Two Elders: HA ha ha ha! HA ha ha ha!
Runs With Premise: What are they doing?
Runs With Premise: Impossible!
Townsfolk: Yeah! All right! Woohoo! Oh we did it! We did it! Oh my God! Oh this is amazing!
Mr. Mackey: We have plenty enough to save our town now!
Mr. Garrison: We can save the town and be super-rich!
Randy: Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!
Gerald: Let it ride!!
Kyle: What the hell are they doing??
Roulette Dealer: Two, red. You lose.
Townsfolk: AWWWWWWW!!
Randy: Dammit!
Stan: They, they had it! They freakin' had it!
Stan: You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
Randy: Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.
Stan: A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!
Randy: Stan? Okay?
Stan: What???
Randy: All right? Stan? Okay?
Randy: Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes.
Mr. Mackey: It's over, Stanley. What else can we do?
Stan: We can stay. And fight.
Cartman: Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Alex: Yeah! They don't own our town! We do!
Chef: I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics.
Randy: It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.
Runs with Premise: Get out of our way.
Stan: No! We won't let you destroy our town!
Runs with Premise: Boys. It isn't your town anymore.
Stan: Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.
Kyle: You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
Stan: This land is not for sale.
Runs with Premise: Dammit! I thought you said they were dealt with!
Elder 1: They were!
Mr. Garrison: Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money!
Principal Victoria: Filthy bastard Native American money!
Mr. Garrison: Uh oh, right, huh. Sorry about that.
Jimbo: We'll never give up! You bastards!
Alex: Yeah! South Park is ours.
Mr. Mackey: But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever.
Runs with Premise: What is the state of our people?
Elder 2: Last night I spoke with the spirit of the bear, and Bear said that if we do not build our highway soon, our investors may soon sell off their shares of the new casino.
Elder 1: Yes, and Eagle says the cumulative shared market loss on the revenue of the new casino drops fifteen percent every day.
Runs with Premise: Then we must force the South Park people off their petty land.
Elder 1: But they are determined and proud. And the spirit of the wind has stated that if we use force, it could be a publicity nightmare, further hurting our net assets.
Elder 1: Blankets?
Mr. Garrison: We're not moving, ass-faces!
Elders: Free blanket? Free blanket? Free blanket...
Field Reporter: Tom, it now looks as if the Native Americans are handing out blankets as a sign of good-will towards the South Park people. What an incredible display of compassion. I certainly hope there's nothing sinister behind it.
Randy: You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
Runs with Premise: It is only a blanket, Mister Marsh.
Runs with Premise: Oh. You're welcome.
Stan: It's all right, dad.
Randy: How's your... mother?
Randy: It's cool on my tongue.
Stan: You're gonna be all right.
Randy: Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.
Stan: No, Dad, NO.
Stan: What can I do?
Randy: You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.
Stan: Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!
Stan: Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-
Stan: Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?
Wise Man: Me?? Huh, no. I am just a guide. Sit down.
Stan: An inward journey? That sounds kinda gay.
Runs with Premise: How much longer must we wait for our superhighway??
Elder 1: SARS has spread throughout the entire town of South Park, Chief Runs with Premise. Their wills will break soon.
Runs with Premise: Then I suppose we must be patient.
Woman: Runs with Premise, come quickly!
Runs with Premise: What is the matter, wife?
Woman: It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick.
Runs with Premise: Premise Running Thin, what is the matter?
Woman: He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!
Runs with Premise: No! I told you not to touch them!
Premise Running Thin: Papa. Papa...
Runs with Premise: This would not have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away! No more waiting around! Tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan! Shock and Awe!
Stan: Dad! Dad!
Randy: Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
Kyle: Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
Alex: Thanks to you, we're all safe now, Stan.
Randy: We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.
Elder 1: It is amazing. All our plants and herbs failed to heal him.
Elder 2: But your people's remedy brings the spirit of the buffalo back into his heart. Perhaps there are many things we can learn from your way of life.
Randy: We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.
Alex: Well, I guess we all learned that South Park is more than just a town. It's a community that nobody can split up.
Stan: Dude, who the hell are you?
Alex: Alex. Alex Glick. I got to come on and do the guest voice thingy.
Kyle: What?! Get the hell out of here!
Alex: Hi Mom! Hi Dad! Hi Jill!
Stan: Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
Cartman: What? Tell us?
Stan: I know!
Kenny: (I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)
Stan: Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.
Kyle: What?
Kyle: Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.
Stan: You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.
Stan: Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
Cartman: We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
Kenny: (That's the truth.)
Sheila: My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.
Sharon: Oh hi Gerald, Sheila.
Gerald: Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.
Sharon: Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.
Other Men: Geraaald! Hi Gerald.
Randy: Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.
Gerald: What's that?
Skeeter: Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.
Stuart: Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.
Randy: It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?
Sharon: Don't our men look
Sheila: It is?
Sharon: Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures.
Linda: And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.
Sarah: My Steven shaved his chest and his balls. Oooh, I love it!
Sharon: And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever.
Sheila: I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...
Stan: Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
Cartman: That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
Kenny: (Woohoo!!)
Butters: Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classes.
Stan: Hey Craig.
Craig: You guys look pretty gay.
Craig: Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay!
Stan: These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
Stan: Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!
Chef: No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!
Stan: We're metrosexual!!
Kyle: Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.
Chef: Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool.
Mr. Garrison: All right children, let's take our seats.
Mr. Garrison: Well, uh d-don't you all look nice.
Stan: Dude! W-what are you doing?
Kyle: I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
Craig: HA! Told you you guys were straight!
Stan: We're not straight! You're straight!
Jason, Craig, Tweek, Token: You're straight!
Cartman: You're straight like a freeway!
Mr. Garrison: What the hell is going on??
Cartman: You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
Cartman: ...So? I'm half bisexual!
Mr. Garrison: Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!
Cartman: I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
Mr. Garrison: WHAT??
Mr. Slave: Oh, Jesus Christ.
Jimbo: Uh, for what?
Mr. Garrison: Well, you know...
Jimbo: No.
Mr. Garrison: Huh.
Mr. Garrison: Oh hey Randy.
Randy: You're looking ultra-fabulous.
Mr. Garrison: Not, not like that?
Mr. Garrison: Uh-Oh, thanks, Mr. Tweek.
Richard: My pleasure, silly-buns.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, wuh, well uh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place.
Richard: Why?
Mr. Garrison: Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass.
Mr. Slave: Woohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.
Richard: Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight.
Mr. Garrison: Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!
Patrons: Huh?
Mr. Garrison: Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?!
Randy: Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.
Mr. Garrison: Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!
Jimbo: Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt.
Skeeter: So, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now.
Patrons: Yeah.
Cartman: Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
Stan: Wow, is that from Origins?
Cartman: Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
Stan: Well, what can we do about it?
Cartman: We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
Stan: What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
Cartman: Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
Stan: Yeah. Wait, what?
Cartman: You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
Craig: Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!
Kyle: No! Ah!
Sheila: WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?
Kyle: No! For not being a metrosexual.
Sheila: Gerald! Gerald, get down here!
Kyle: Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?
Sheila: The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.
Gerald: Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.
A voice: There you go! Now you look fabulous.
Kyan: You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders for your look.
Kyle: GRRRRR!!
Chef: Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison.
Chef: Sure. Come on in.
Chef: Well, what do you want me to do about it?
Mr. Garrison: Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?
Chef: Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.
Kyle: One ticket to New York, please.
Clerk: Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes.
Kyle: Mrrh.
Kyle: Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison: Kyle, what are you doing here?
Mr. Garrison: What?? That's what I'm doing!
Kyle: Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
Mr. Garrison: They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!
Kyle: I thought of it first!
Mr. Garrison: No you didn't! No you didn't!
Kyle: Did so! Did so!
Mr. Garrison: I thought of it yesterday!
Kyle: I thought of it two days ago!
Mr. Garrison: I thought of it before you were born!
Mr. Slave: Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?
Kyle: Cool.
Stan: Wow, we look great!
Cartman: Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
Richard: Oh my God!
Man: Let's go! Let's go!
Gerald: Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!
Sharon: You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.
Linda: I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.
Mrs. Tweek: I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad.
Carson: What can I say? We're fabulous.
Head of Programming: You guys are changing the world! And tomorrow, we're gonna have you make over the President of the United States!
Head of Programming: What? We didn't order any room service.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up.
Kyle: Clear!
Mr. Garrison: Well crap, that didn't work.
Stan: You'd better shut up, Craig.
Craig: Everyone knows it's true!
Stan: It is not!
Craig: Is so!
Tom: Craig! Behave yourself!
Randy: Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?
Stan: Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
Randy: What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.
Tom: Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.
Randy: Oh really?!
Tom: I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman.
Men: Ooooo.
Randy: Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.
Other men: Oh no, errrr!
Tom: You don't... like us being metrosexual?
The Women: NO!
Randy: Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!
The Males: Yeah!!
Linda: What?
Jimbo: We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!
Sharon: This is crazy!
Ryan: Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness!
Stuart: We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!
Kenny: (Woohoohoo!)
Randy: Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!
The Males: Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets!
Mrs. Tweek: What the hell did that show do to them?
Officer: You sure you don't want to press charges?
Kyan: That's okay, officer. I think they learned murder is wrong.
Carson: Especially in those pants.
Jai: Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing on TV!
Mr. Garrison: But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.
Thom: You just had to push it, didn't you?!
Jai: Just had to keep asking question!
Kyle: They aren't gay? Then what are they?
Kyan: For a thousand years our kind have lived beneath the earth's crust! Banished by man in the Kindling Wars.
Leader: We are the Crab People!
Kyle: AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Mr. Slave: Jesus Christ!
Crab People: Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!.
Crab People: Crab People! Crab People!
Crab Solo: Taste like crab, talk like people.
Crab People: Crab People!
Kyle: You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
Linda: I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.
Skeeter: Put it out! Put it out!
Randy: I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
Skeeter: The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!
Skeeter: Eeeek!
Randy: Put it out! Put it out! Fire!
Carson: Mr. President, it is such an honor to make you over!
Kyan: Now, we've got to do something with your hair.
Thom: And your nails are filthy. Let's get those clean.
Mr. Garrison: Stop them! They're crab people!
Crab Man 3: They cannot see or hear us, foolish man. Now stand by and watch as your pitiful race becomes helpless!!
Mr. Garrison: You bastards!
Sharon: There they are! Get 'em!
Linda: You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!
Head of Programming: Oh my God, what are they doing?!
Sharon: We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.
Linda: That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.
Sarah: We're sorry, but we knew that the only answer was tuh kill the Queer Eye guys.
Head of Programming: Oh my God. They were crab people.
Kyle: Mom!
Sheila: Kyle!
Head of Programming: Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over. Gentlemen, back to Studio 12! We're gonna bring back the Latin fad.
Randy: Hey eses.
Stan: Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
Kyle: What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
Stan: Yeah. It's cool, holmes.
Kyle: No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
Kyle: God-damnit!
Kyle: He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
Kenny: (What? Is it?)
Kyle: I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
Stan: See what?
Kyle: That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
Stan: I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
Kyle: You're on, fat boy!
Butters: Oh, hi Eric.
Butters: Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... inspiration.
Cartman: I told you, Token.
Token: So, what are we doing?
Cartman: Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
Butters: Wow!
Cartman: We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
Butters: Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
Gerald: Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
Kyle: Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
Gerald: Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.
Kyle: Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
Gerald: The answer is no, Kyle.
Kyle: Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!
Sheila: Kyle, don't belittle your own people!
Stan: Hey dude.
Kyle: It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
Stan: No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
Kyle: Really?
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Stan: You got a computer?
Stan: See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
Kenny: (Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)
Stan: Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
Stan: What the hell is that?
Agent 5: Move move move move move move! Move!
Token: I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!
Butters: Well done!
Kyle: What's the matter with him?
Detective: This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it.
Kyle: We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
Kyle: So, he's gonna get it, right?
Detective: I see an island without an owner. If things keep going the way they are, the child will not get his tropical paradise.
Cartman: Almost there, you guys.
Butters: Ow...
Token: Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?
Butters: Cheese!
Butters: Cheese!
Cartman: No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
Butters: Oh...
Gerald: Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.
Detective: It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson.
Stan: Boy, I'll say!
Detective: If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees.
Kenny: (Yeah)
Stan: Oh yeah.
Kyle: Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Field Reporter: Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play. The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week.
Kyle: We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
Cartman: It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
Kyle: You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
Stan: Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
Kyle: Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
Stan: What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
T-Shirt Vendor: Psalm T-Shirts! Get a T-Shirt with your favorite psalm!
Bible Vendor: Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith.
Cartman: Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
Elderly Woman: Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren. They need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics.
Cartman: Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
A Man: Yeah Jesus!
Cartman: Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
Stan: Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
Randy: Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue.
Stan: But they kill people.
Randy: Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.
Sharon: Oooh, Hi Dad.
Randy: Yes Dad.
Marvin: And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!
Randy: Yes I know.
Marvin: And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive!
Stan: I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.
Elderly Man: Damnit Mona, this isn't the fastest way to Country Kitchen Buffet!
Elderly Man: You save the most gas if you take the highway to Country Kitchen Buffet!
Elderly Man: There's Country Kitchen right there!
Mona: Where?
Mona: Is this the parking lot?
Elderly Man: I think so.
Marvin: Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell!
Marvin: That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell!
Elderly Woman 1: I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question!
Marvin: So now, what are we gonna do about it?
Elderly Man 3: Do about what?
Elderly Woman 3: They're gonna take our licenses away.
Marvin: That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite!
Elderly Man 3: Great idea, Marvin!
Elderly Woman 4: Wait, ah I think we're having that meeting right now.
Elderly Man 4: Right. To get those damn kids to stop skateboarding on the sidewalks!
Sharon: He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center.
Sharon: Every senior in town will be driving home...
Someone: Oh my Goddd!
Elderly Woman 1: So long, everybody.
Gerald: We've gotta get out of here!
Randy: The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!
Gerald: They, they're... they're playing street hockey!
Kyle: It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
Cartman: I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
Kyle: Dude, look!
Stan: What is that?
Kyle: I don't know.
Kyle: Dude, is that your dad?
Stan: I think so.
Cartman: Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
Randy: -STREETS!! OFF-
Stan: What is he saying?
Kyle: I can't understand him.
Randy: GAAAAAH!!
Cartman: Old people!
Kyle: Why are they all out driving at the same time?
Kyle: Aah! There's another one!
Randy and the Boys: AAAHH!!
Cartman: They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
Stan: Dad, I'm scared.
Stan: I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
Elderly Driver: How the hell did we get up here?
Elderly Passenger: I told you this was the wrong way!
Field Reporter: Tom, I'm standing outside of the Department of Motor Vehicles, where senior citizens have until three p.m. to hand over their driver's licenses. The new law was passed just three days after the Night of Horror, in which all seniors were out driving at the same time, causing fourteen deaths and three million dollars in damage.
Elderly Man 2: It ain't right what you're doin'! I never had an accident in my life!
Elderly Man 6: But how am I supposed to get to the grocery store? Or the pharmacy to buy medicine?
DMV Official: Well, maybe you should be in a nursing home. Hmmm?
Elderly Man 7: Some of us would rather die!
DMV Official: Well, we can certainly help you with that, too.
Elderly Woman 7: We aren't second-class citizens!
Elderly Man 8: That's right! You can take our licenses, but you'll never take our pride!
An Elderly Man: Yeah...
Cartman: Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
Marvin: Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around.
Stan: Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.
Marvin: God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!
Stan: Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.
Barbrady: Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!
Barbrady: Could I see your license, please?
Marvin: I ain't got one! You peckers took it!
Barbrady: Well then, I have to take you to jail.
Marvin: You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try!
Marvin: Stupid son of a- God damnit!
Barbrady: I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.
Randy: Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!
Marvin: Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!
Randy: You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!
Marvin: Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.
Marvin: Kiss my sagging ass!
Randy: Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!
Marvin: Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP!
Stan: What's that?
Cartman: More old people!
Stan: The American Association of Retired Persons.
Mr. Garrison: Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back.
AARP leader: Set up a perimeter! Bring Bravo Team to Point Delta!
Cartman: Old people gone mad!
AARP leader: Marvin Marsh?
AARP leader: I'm Bill Stewart, President of the AARP. Hu-we've come to help the seniors in this town fight back.
Marvin: Oh, it's nice to meet ya, Bill.
Stewart: Huh?? We came as fast as we could. We just had to stop by Country Kitchen Buffet first.
Elderly Woman: The revolution?
Mrs. Wyland: Oh, I suppose so.
Randy: What the hell is going on?!
Gerald: Randy, what is this?
Stewart: Hey! You are now under the authority of the AARP!
Marvin: Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!
Randy: Dad, what are you doing??
Marvin: The AARP is gonna help us take this town until we get our licenses back!
Elderly Man: Yeah.
Marvin: Isn't that a little extreme, Bill?
Randy: This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!
Marvin: The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now!
Marvin: All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station.
AARP member: Reinforcements have arrived from the nursing home in Conifer.
Stewart: Good! Hell, us senior citizens could take over the entire country!
Stewart: Mrs. Applegate, show 'em we mean business.
Tank Driver: What do you want?
Marvin: We want our licenses back!
Other Seniors: Yeah!
Elderly Woman: That's right. And we want more money in Medi-Care!
Other Seniors: Yeah!
Elderly Man: And we want those damned kids to stop skateboardin' on the sidewalk!
Other Seniors: Yeah!
Stan: Hey Dad.
Stan: Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
Randy: They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!
Kyle: They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
Stan: No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
Randy: No, son. We... like to sleep in.
Stan: Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.
Cartman: Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
Stan: Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Cartman: You have AIDS?
Kyle: No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!
Kyle: It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
Cartman: You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
Kyle: Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
Cartman: Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
Cartman: Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
Kyle: Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
Cartman: I have never been a dick to you.
Cartman: Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
Kyle: I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
Cartman: What isn't it?
Kyle: That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
Cartman: ...I don't understand the difference.
Jimmy: Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-problem?
Cartman: Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people?
Jimmy: Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.
Jimmy: Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote.
Cartman: Like what?
Jimmy: Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.
Cartman: Who's there?
Butters: Wow, that's gonna be so fun!
Stan: Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
Cartman: Hey Kyle.
Kyle: Well?
Cartman: Well what?
Cartman: I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
Kyle: Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.
Cartman: So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
Kyle: I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
Cartman: I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
Kyle: That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
Cartman: Good.
Kyle: And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
Butters: What's this all about, Eric?
Butters: Well, sure I can!
Cartman: For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
Cartman: A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
Cartman: Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
Butters: It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
Cartman: Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
Butters: When do you think uh it'll get here?
Butters: What??
Cartman: According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
Butters: Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!
Cartman: No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
Butters: Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??
Butters: Oh Jeez!
Butters: But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
Cartman: No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
Butters: Are you sure?
Butters: But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
Kyle: Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
Sheila: Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.
Kyle: Oh. Thanks, dude.
Kyle: Oh wait. Cartman.
Cartman: Yes?
Kyle: Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
Kyle: I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
Cartman: Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
Kyle: All right, let's go.
Kyle: Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
Linda: Oh Butters!
Kyle: Aw dude, weak.
Kyle: Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
Stan: Yeah, it's kinda weird.
Kyle: Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
Stan: Yeah.
Sheila: That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.
Cartman: Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
Butters: Wuh, wait, well, what happened??
Butters: What about my parents. Did you see them?
Cartman: No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
Butters: Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
Field Reporter: Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling.
Captain: All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him.
Cartman: What what what?
Butters: Who's coming this way?
Cartman: The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
Butters: Oh God! I hate cannibals!
Cartman: They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
Butters: Noooo!
Butters: But I can't see nothin'.
Butters: Are we out in the destruction?
Cartman: Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
Butters: Aw man.
Cartman: Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
Butters: Huh... Oh, it's terrible.
Cartman: We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
Butters: Whoa!
Butters: Whaaat??
Butters: AAAAHH!
Butters: Waaaaaah!
Butters: Ooohhhh!
Butters: Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!
Butters: Oh no!
Cartman: We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
Butters: Uh w-where??
Butters: Aren't you coming?
Butters: Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
Stan: Really?
Kyle: Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Stan: Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
Cartman: Happy Birthday to you. Happy- [looks at the other boys for support]
Butters: [off-screen] You take away the biggest part of me. [the worker listens, then goes to the source of the sound] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go. [hums a bit; the worker arrives to see him sweeping] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
Worker: With what?
Butters: You're not a cannibal, are you?
Worker: No
Worker: Kid, what are you doin' here?
Worker: Kid, I don't know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump.
Butters: Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
Worker: No, I mean you're at the garbage dump. The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they've been looking for you for over a week.
Kyle: Oh, awesome.
Stan: I knew he'd turn up.
Kyle: What?
Kyle: What?
Sheila: Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
Cartman: But... Casa Bonita.
Stan: Cartman, stop it!
Captain: All right, kid! End of the line!
Captain: Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it?
Gary: Hello everybody. It's really great to meet you all.
Gary: I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!
Stan: Yeah, screw that kid!
Kyle: Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
Cartman: Yeah. Somebody needs to put him in him place!
Butters: He's a peckerface, that's what he is!
Cartman: Go kick his ass, Stan.
Clyde: Yeah, go kick his ass.
Stan: Well, maybe he won't fight.
Cartman: Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
Kyle: Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!
Craig: Yeah, little bitch!
Stan: No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.
Gary: Excuse me?
Stan: Dude, stop it.
Stan: Shut up, Butters!
Gary: The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday.
Token: What?! How did that happen?
Cartman: You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
Kyle: You're having dinner with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
Mom: Hey, it's Gary!
Older sister: Gary!
Older brother: Great to see you!
Mom: How are you?
Gary: Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad.
Dad: Hi Stan!
Mom: It's so nice to meet you.
Mark: Hi!
Jenny: Hey!
Gary: My little brother Dave.
Dave: Hi!
Gary: And my baby sister Amanda.
Dad: Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan!
Stan: What's that?
Gary: That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that?
Stan: No.
Dad: Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan!
Jenny: Oh yeah!
The kids: My family!
Mark: All right! Go Dave!
Gary: Yeah!
Mark: That's a great story, Sarah.
Dad: All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon!
Mark: All right!
Kids: Yeah!
Mark: Woohoo! OOWW!
Stan: The... Book of Mormon? What's that?
Gary: You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.
Mark: Only the most important person in the world.
Jenny: You've never heard of him?
Stan: No!
Gary: Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad.
The other kids: Oh yes, tell us Dad. Yeah Dad. All right.
Blacksmith: There goes that kooky Joseph Smith.
Customer: You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus.
Stan: All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
Cartman: Right. What are we playing again?
Stan: Football.
Bebe: Wendy breaks up.
Cartman: What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
Bebe: Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!
Butters: Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
Cartman: Yeh-heah, right!
Stan: Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
Stan: 'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
Kyle: Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
Wendy: Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.
Jimmy: Hey Stan.
Stan: Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
Jimmy: For- Forw- Forw-w-w what?
Jimmy: She's what?
Stan: She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
Wendy: Yeah?
Stan: Well?
Butters: We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
Kyle: Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
Stan: Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
Cartman: God, what a fag!
Stan: You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
Kyle: Jeez, he's worse than I thought.
Butters: Well what do we do now?
Jimmy: Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
Kyle: No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
Butters: What's Raisins?
Kyle: What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
Jimmy: Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven.
Butters: This place is awesome!
Butters: Whoa!
Lexus: How are we doing this afternoon?
The Boys: Good.
Lexus: I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
Lexus: So what can I get you?
Butters: You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
Blonde 3: Woohoo!
Redhead: Oh Yeah!
Kyle: Hey. Uh, this is Stan.
Stan: Can we go, please?
Butters: Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
Lexus: Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see you again??
Raisins Girl: Bye, guys! Thanks for coming to Raisins!
Jimmy: Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now?
Stan: No, dude, I feel worse!
Kyle: Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
Stan: Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
Kyle: What are you doing?
Bebe: Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of.
Lexus: Okay, Porsche, see you tomorrow. Bye, Mercedes.
Lexus: Uh oh. Uh, hi, sweetie.
Butters: I waited all night for you to get off work.
Butters: I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
Lexus: Could you uh just help walk me to my- bike?
Butters: Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
Butters: O-kay!
Lexus: Bye, cutie!
Kyle: Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
Kyle: Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
Stan: But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
Stan: All right, so how do I join you?
Michael: If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do.
Stan: ...'K.
Mercedes: Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you.
Ferrari: Okay.
Ferrari: Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes.
Raisins Girl: Hi, welcome to Raisins!
Butters: Hi! Is Lexus here?
Lexus: Hey, cutie.
Butters: Darling!
Michael: All right, your turn, Stan. Read one of your poems about pain.
Henrietta: Whoa.
Pete: Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!
Stan: They're not?
Michael: No, dude! You can't say "I miss you so much, babe. I want to hold you in my arms."
Henrietta: Make it "I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades."
Henrietta: Go away Mom! Leave me alone!
Henrietta's Mom: Daddy and I just got your birthday present! But you can't see what it is till tomorrow!
Henrietta: You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face.
Henrietta's Mom: Ee-you are so creative, honey.
Henrietta: Conformist bitch.
Other Goths: Yeah.
Porsche: Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Porsche. Have you tried our Double Whammy Wings?
Lexus: Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Lexus.
Butters: Hey Lexus.
Lexus: Hi, sweetie! Who's this?
Butters: Wuh it's me, Butters.
Lexus: Good, good.
Butters: Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
Butters: Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
Butters: Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
Butters: Uh but I spent it all.
Linda: What are you spending all that money on, Butters?
Butters: On my girlfriend.
Linda: You... have a girlfriend, Butters?
Chris: And she's... a... girl, right?
Butters: Yup!
Chris: Well all right! Good for you, Butters!
Linda: Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?
Stephen: Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.
Michael: Hey, can we get more coffee over here?
Other Goths: Yeah.
Stan: Well I don't drink coffee.
Kyle: Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
Kyle: God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
Stan: So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
Pete: I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.
Kyle: Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
Stan: What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
Kyle: Yeah. She is.
Stan: Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
Henrietta: For sure.
Other Goths: Yeah.
Mercedes: Hi, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?
Butters: Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
Linda: Stephen, what is this place?
Stephen: I, don't know.
Boy: Yeah.
Stephen: Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money.
Linda: Little girl, you shouldn't be working here.
Porsche: I shouldn't? Where I supposed to be working?
Linda: No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.
Porsche: I could cure cancer? Omigod! That would be sooo cool! I had a cancer sore on my lip once and it hurt sooo bad.
Linda: ... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.
Butters: Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.
Lexus: Hi. Welcome to Raisins.
Stephen: Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?
Linda: Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.
Butters: Huh?
Stephen: You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.
Lexus: What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.
Butters: ... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
Lexus: I'm sorry, sweetie.
Butters: So that's it? We're broken up now?
Michael: Look at that. Another tortured soul.
Stan: Butters?
Stan: What's the matter with you?
Henrietta: Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?
Michael: That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want.
Pete: Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
Butters: Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
Stan: Huh? But you just got dumped.
Pete: Yeah.
Stan: No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
Michael: Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!
Kyle: What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
Kyle: Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
Stan: Yeah. Let's play ball.
The Broflovskis: Chanukah, Chanukah, sivivon, sov, sov
Ike: I gotta go tinkle.
Kyle: No Ike! Shh!
The Broflovskis: [while Ike and Kyle talk] Sov, sov, sov! Sov, sov, sov! Ma nayim vi-tov.
Man: Gerald Broflovski?
Gerald: Yes?
Man: My name is Harry Gintz and this is my wife Elise. We're from Canada.
Gerald: Yes, I can tell.
Sheila: Gerald, what the hell is going on?
Gerald: I'm not sure.
Harry: It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada. The whole country was devastated by the cola wars. It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby.
Sheila: Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gintz, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.
Elise: I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter, we came to take him back.
Gerald: What?
Harry: We want to take Peter home, to Canada.
Sheila: Are you crazy?!
Gerald: Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.
Harry: Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear. And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home.
Sheila: The new Canadian Prime Minister?
Harry: He doesn't belong here. He belongs in Canada with his own kind.
Sheila: I think you'd better leave.
Harry: Please, don't make things any harder for Peter.
Harry: We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that!
Gerald: Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!
Judge: I'm sorry to say that my hands are tied. The new Prime Minister of Canada has authority this court cannot override. By Canadian law I must award custody of the child to his birth parents.
The Gintzes: Yes!
Elise: Yes!
Sheila: No!
Sheila: Gerald, do something!
Kyle: Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
Harry: Come on, Peter, we should get going.
Elise: Peter, you must come with Mommy and Daddy.
Ike: No no no no no!
Harry: We're going to take good care of him.
Gerald: Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.
Cartman: Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
Stan: Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
Stan: Sure dude.
Kyle: It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
Cartman: We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
Stan: Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
Cartman: Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmas time.
Stan: Dude, Cartman.
Cartman: I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
Mayor McDaniels: As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help?
Mayor McDaniels: Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you "NO!"
Mr. Garrison: Rats!
Chef: The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?
Cartman: HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
Liane: That's a great idea, Chef.
Cartman: What?
Randy: Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!
Cartman: You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
Kyle: What?
Stan: Whoa whoa, Cartman.
Cartman: It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
Stan: Cartman, calm down!
Stan: It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.
Cartman: You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
Kyle: It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
Stan: Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
Cartman: Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
Kyle: Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
Kyle: Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
Mr. Kim: Oooh, Canada. Okay, that's uh pretty far. Gonna cost ya a lot of money... hmm let's see. How many people?
Kyle: Four.
Mr. Kim: Okay. Four people, Canada, cost a lot of money, that uh gonna be about ah six thousand five hundred dolla.
Kyle: How about fifty daura?
Mr. Kim: Fifty daura?! You flight to Canada cost at least three thousand dollar!
Kyle: Fifty-five daura.
Mr. Kim: Hey! Stop wasting my time with fifty-five daura! No way I take my plane to Canada for less than a thousand daura!
Kyle: Okay. Sixty daura.
Mr. Kim: Sixty-two daura.
Kyle: Okay.
Mr. Kim: Okay. Meet me Park County Airfield, yellow Cessna, tail number 432G.
Kenny: (Me neither!)
Kyle: Why not?
Kenny: ('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!)
Kyle: You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
Cartman: You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
Stan: No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
Cartman: Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
Kyle: All right! We're going to Canada!
Cartman: Sweet.
Stan: What's going on??
Cartman: Look out!
Kyle: No.
Kyle: Hey! We're in Canada!
Doctor: Well of course you are! And Canada Friends welcomes you!
Kyle: Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
Canadians: His brother is our quest. The question is, is what? You must talk to the new Prime Minister if you think his brother's home's back there.
Cartman: Oh Jesus Christ.
Scott: Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!
Kyle: Who's that?
Doctor: That's Scott! He's a dick
Doctor: Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these boys alone!
Man in Barrel: God, what a dick!
Kyle: Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
Kyle: So how do we get to Ottawa?
Wrestler: Oh that's easy. You just have to follow the road.
Cartman: Which road?!
Priest: Follow the only road.
Man: Follow the only road.
Road Workers: And it's paved and wide and up to code.
Stan: All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
Kyle: Word!
Canadians: You're off to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!
Doctor: Good-bye, friends! Good luck with the new Prime Minister! And remember to watch out for Scott! He's a dick!
Canadians: Good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck.
Mountie: Ahoy there, travelers.
Kyle: Who are you?
Sheep: Baaaah.
Stan: I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
Sheep: Baaaah.
Cartman: But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
Rick: You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you.
Kyle: That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
Cartman: Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
Rick: All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada.
Kyle: French Canada?
Mime: Honh honh honnnh! Welcome to French Canada.
Hockey Player: We have everything your heart could desire. Trapezes. Trampolines. And lots and lots of cheese.
Stan: Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
Kyle: We don't have time for this.
Kyle: Hello?
Mime: Allo. If you are going to see za new Prime Minister, then I want to go with you. He has passed a new law forbidding us French Canadians to drink wine.
Kyle: Okay, you can come with us.
Mime: Honh honnnh! Very good! Let us make haste!
Mime: Is a bullshit Canada
Rick: Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place!
Mime: It reminds me of death and fear.
Cartman: How much further to Ottawa?! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
Rick: We must be very close now.
Rick: Waaaah!
Mime: Oh no. It's Scott.
Scott: What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!
Rick: You're a dick, Scott!
Scott: You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you!
Scott: Who the hell are you?!
Fisherman: I'm Steve the Newfoudlander. And you're on Newfoundland property now! Get off before I have you arrested!
Rick: Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie!
Kyle: God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
Steve: Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh? He sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland. Life just hasn't been the same since he made sodomy illegal.
Mime: Well, come with us! Maybe you can ask him to take his sodomy ban away.
Kyle: Can we just get going, please?
Steve: Yeah, sure, except there's just one problem.
Stan: What?
Steve: You folks are goin' the wrong way.
Stan: What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
Steve: Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction on it.
Mime: Of course. Ottawa left, Newfoundland right!
Kyle: There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
Rick: It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there!
Rick: Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time!
Kyle: Do you think we can still make it in time?
Cartman: We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.
Steve: Here we are at the Parliament buildin'.
Mime: Ze Prime Minister is inside.
Doorman: Yes?
Kyle: We need to see the new Prime Minister.
Kyle: Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
Doorman: All right all right, I was lying. The Prime Minister IS here.
Prime Minister: I am the Prime Minister of Canada. What do you guys want?
Kyle: Ike!
Ike: Kyle!
Scott: Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!
Prime Minister: That is a great speech, guy. But the answer is no! All of my new laws will stay in effect forever!
Scott: Haha, you lose, Americans!
Rick: Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses.
Mime: And we won't get our wine.
Steve: And we can't perform sodomy, eh?
Kenny: (Aah!)
Stan: Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Rick: Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein!
Saddam Hussein: Saddam Hussein?? Naw, relax, buddah. I'm not him.
Mime: Zat explains everything! Za new Prime Minister was Saddam Hussein, once again trying to take over our beloved Canada like he did before.
Soldier 1: Saddam Hussein?
Soldier 2: He was fooling us?
Rick: Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back!
Mime: And we can drink our wine.
Steve: And I can sodomize me boys again
Elise: Perhaps we were wrong to try and take Peter back. He doesn't belong here. He belongs with his family.
Stan: What is that?
Cartman: It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
Kyle: Well yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
Kyle: Dude, come on.
Rick: Hey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!
Stan: Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
Cartman: Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!
Kenny: (Shuriken. Awesome!)
Stan: Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
Stan: We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
Kyle: Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
Stan: Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
Stan: What's your ninja name, Kenny?
Stan: All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
Cartman: Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.
Kenny: (Yeah, that'd be awesome!)
Cartman: Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
Kyle: I still say this is a bad idea.
Craig: Where'd you get those?
Stan: We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
Stan: Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
Kyle: But don't tell anybody we have them.
Cartman: Ugh.
Clyde: Let me see.
Cartman: Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
Butters: Hey fellas. What's happenin'?
Cartman: We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
Butters: Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
Cartman: No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
Butters: I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
Linda: Hi Butters.
Linda: Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?
Linda: Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.
Stan: Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
Kyle: Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.
Cartman: Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
Kyle: God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
Stan: Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
Cartman: I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
Cartman: I have the power to have all the powers I want.
Kyle: That doesn't count, fatass!
Kyle: Who the hell is that?
Stan: I dunno. Craig, is that you?
Kyle: Whoa.
Cartman: Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Butters: Nuh uh!
Stan: Yeah, huh, I got you!
Butters: Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
Cartman: That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
Kyle: Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
Kyle: God dammit Cartman!
Cartman: Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
Butters: Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
Stan: Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!
Cartman: Oh, shit, dude!
Kenny: (I just threw my ninja star at him.)
Kyle: Oh man! We are in serious trouble!
Stan: Dude, shut up!
Kyle: I agree with Cartman!
Stan: What?!
Kyle: You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
Stan: Just stay still, Butters.
Kyle: Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!
Cartman: Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
Kyle: If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.
Stan: God dammit!
Butters: Whoa, I'm getting woozy.
Stan: We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
Cartman: Dr. Shafley?
Stan: He's really old and going blind.
Cartman: So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
Kyle: Oh no.
Stan: We might pass him off as our pet.
Stan, Kyle, Cartman: Shut up, Butters!
Stan: All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
Cartman: Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
Cartman: Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
Butters: Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff.
Stan: All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
Cartman: Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
Stan: Oh shit, somebody's coming!
Cartman: No way, you got weapons too?!
Stan: Where'd you get those?
Jimmy: From the n-n- from the nn-, from the nn-
Clyde: From the nice guy at the county fair.
Craig: At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead.
Cartman: Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
Stan: Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.
Kyle: He said, not now, Craig!
Jimmy: Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?
Clyde: Then fight us!
Cartman: Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
Kyle: I swore to never fight again.
Kyle: Oh no. Butters!
Cartman: Butters!
Craig: Lose who?
Craig: Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding?
Craig: Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!
Stan: No dude, you gotta help us find him!
Craig: To hell with that!
Cartman: We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
Stan: Butters!
Kyle: Butters!
Cartman: Here, Butters!
Kenny: (Butters!)
Craig: Butters!
Clyde: Butters!
Token: Butters!
Jimmy: Bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- Butters!
Cartman: Butter- Butters!
Kyle: Hey Butters!
Stan: Butters!
Chef: Hello there, children!
The Boys: Hey, Chef.
Chef: How's it goin'?
Stan: Bad.
Chef: Why bad?
Kyle: Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?
Chef: No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?
Stan: Nothing, just... playing.
Chef: Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out.
Kyle: Yeah, we know.
Nurse: Can you help him, Doctor?
Dr. Doctor: I'm afraid I wouldn't know how. Unfortunately for this little fella, I'm a people doctor. Best we call the animal shelter.
Stan: Butters!
Kyle: Butters!
Cartman: Here, Butters!
Kenny: (Butters!)
Craig: Butters!
Clyde: Butters!
Token: Butters!
Craig: Butters! Where the hell are you?!
Stan: What?
Stan: Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
Kyle: We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!
Cartman: Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
Stan: It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.
Butters: Gaaaah!
Assistant: Somebody threw a ninja star in that poor puppy's eye?
Roger: Can I help you boys?
Stan: We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
Roger: Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds.
Kyle: Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!
Roger: I thought you told me your parents were dead.
Stan: What is it, Craig?
Craig: It's Butters! We saw 'im!
Kyle: Where?!
Craig: Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.
Stan: Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.
Craig: Butters is right on the other side.
Kyle: We have to get past them!
Cartman: All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
Randy: What happened to him?
Sheila: Oh my God!
Stan: Oh, Jesus.
Kyle: Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.
Man 1: Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!
Stan: What?
Cartman: What?
Skeeter: Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the... penis! How am I supposed to explain that to her?!
Kyle: Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?
Stan: Just run with it, dude.
Cartman: Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
Kyle: Yeah, I c- I can't believe it.
Stan: Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
Jimmy: Hey fellas.
Stan: Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
Timmy: Timmy!
Kyle: They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
Stan: Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
Kyle: Yeah, that'd be cool.
Jimmy: Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year.
Kyle: Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
Cartman: Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
Kyle: ...You're an asshole, Cartman.
Cartman: What? What'd I do?
Jimmy: S-s-six!
Timmy: Timmah.
Jimmy: S-s-s-ssseven!
Timmy: Timmah. Timmah!
Jimmy: S-s-seven!
Timmy: Timmah! Timmah!
Francis: Hey Jimmy, g-good luck on Saturday.
Nathan: Hey Jimmy.
Jimmy: Oh he-hey, N-Nathan.
Nathan: So uh, I see you train pretty hard.
Nathan: Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts.
Jimmy: What kind of shortcuts?
Nathan: You know. Steroids.
Nathan: Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests.
Jimmy: So uh, ha-how do they... w-w-work?
Jimmy: How much would this cost me?
Nathan: Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas.
Kyle: What?
Stan: So?
Kyle: Oh no. Cartman, no!
Cartman: It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
Cartman: Why?
Dad: Jimmy?
Dad: Jim, it's your father!
Dad: Jimmy, were you masturbating?
Jimmy: N-no, Dad.
Girl: Hi Jimmy.
Jimmy: Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy.
Nancy: I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow.
Jimmy: Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.
Dad: I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim.
Jimmy: Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week.
Jimmy: Dad, Jesus C-Christ!
Cartman: Moooommmm?
Cartman: Um, could I get you to do something for me?
Liane: What's that, hon?
Liane: Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.
Cartman: I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
Liane: Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.
Cartman: Awesome.
Jimmy: You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving.
Timmy: Timmah!
Jimmy: I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?
Jimmy: Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them!
Jimmy: You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you?
Timmy: Huh! Timmah! T-Timmah!
Jimmy: Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it!
Jimmy: Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.
Coach: All right, thirty yards, Timmy! Keep it up!
Timmy: Oowrrr! Timmah! Livilaye!
Coach 2: Wuh-wow, Jimmy, I can't believe how much you've improved! You're bigger and stronger than I've ever seen you!
Jimmy: Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard.
Coach 2: You keep going like this and you'll break Special Olympics records on Saturday!
Man: Okay, so this is all the stuff we need to sign Michael in?
Volunteer: Yup. Just take the sign-up sheet down to the next table and we'll get it all finalized.
Woman: Thank you very much.
Volunteer: Thank you! Good luck, Michael.
Michael: Thanks.
Volunteer: Okay, next in line please?
Volunteer: Hello there.
Liane: Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.
Cartman: Naaaa!
Volunteer: Oh, great! What's his name?
Liane: Eric Cartman...
Cartman: Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
Volunteer: Okay. Age?
Liane: He's nine.
Volunteer: O-kay, and what's his disability?
Volunteer: ...N-no, I'm asking what his specific condition is. Down's Syndrome? Cerebral palsy?
Cartman: ...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
Volunteer: I'll just leave that blank for now.
Mr. Mackey: Well, Timmy, as your counselor, I want you to know that you can tell me anything, m'kay? And whatever's troublin' you, I wanna try and, and help you with it.
Mr. Mackey: Mmm'kay, right, you're Timmy. ...Yo-you have a problem?
Mr. Mackey: Ji-Jimmy?
Mr. Mackey: Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?
Timmy: Argh. Jimmy...
Mr. Mackey: Right, Jimmy Valmer.
Mr. Mackey: Right. He's Jimmy, yeah.
Cartman: Enter. [Kyle enters, and walks up next to Cartman]
Cartman: Go on, Kyle.
Kyle: I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
Cartman: Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Jew.
Kyle: I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
Cartman: Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
Kyle: I came here to talk about you!
Nancy: Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop.
Jimmy: The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time.
Nancy: I guess I didn't realize I was a waste of time.
Nancy: Jimmy, everyone's worried about you. You seem... different.
Jimmy: They-they're all just... jealous.
Nancy: You're not the boy I fell in love with last week during Free Period. I'm leaving you.
Nancy: You can't treat people like this!
Cartman: One thousand dollars, yeah!
Announcer: Will those athletes in heat 1 of the hundred-meter dash please report to Track Area B.
Winner: All right!
Blond Boy: Good Job.
Blonde Girl: We did it!
Cartman: Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
Cartman: God-damnit!
Announcer: That's another Special Olympics record!
Bonds: The 2004 special athlete is... Jimmy Valmer.
Host: Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know that the Special Olympics isn't just about winning. And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!
Cartman: Ah, screw you hippies!
Host: For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will receive this gift certificate to Shakey's for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric!
Jimmy: What?
McGuire: Hey kid. Good for you for being honest.
Stan: Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.
Cartman: What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
Kyle: I'm a Vulcan!
Cartman: All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
Kyle: I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
Cartman: Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
Cartman: Set phasers on stun.
Stan: Things seem pretty quiet.
Cartman: Yes. A little too quiet.
Kyle: No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
Cartman: Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
Kyle: Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!
Stan: Oh God, here we go again.
Kyle: He does not!
Kyle: Naw uh!
Cartman: Go see the movie, Kyle!
Cartman: You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
Kyle: People don't hate the Jews!
Kyle: One please.
Ticket Salesman: This is an R-rated movie.
Kyle: Yeah, I know, but I have to-
Ticket Salesman: But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in to see it.
Soldier 1: Hac bashtud Christo.
Soldier 2: Et lac Hesus. Belaca veshtad.
Kyle: How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
Ticket Salesman: Pretty brutal, isn't it? Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?
Phillip: Hey Terrance, I think I have a-
Cartman: Mom! Doorbell!
Terrance: Hey Phillip, guess what?
Phillip: What?
Kyle: You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
Cartman: It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
Kyle: You were, you were right?
Kenny: (Goddamn.)
Stan: Dude. That movie sucked.
Kenny: (Yeah, it totally sucked!)
Stan: How can they even call that a movie?
Kenny: (I don't know!)
Stan: That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
Jack: Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was.
Stan: Hey, we want our money back.
Ticket Salesman: Huh?
Stan: That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
Ticket Salesman: I can't refund your money. You sat through the whole movie.
Stan: That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Stan: You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
Ticket Salesman: That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for your sins!
Stan: We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
Ticket Salesman: I'm not allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie! You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.
Stan: W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
Ticket Salesman: Yeah. I'd like to see you try.
Cartman: Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
Stan: No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
Cartman: What?
Stan: We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
Cartman: You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
Stan: Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
Cartman: If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
Stan: Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
Cartman: Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
Stan: I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
Stan: Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
Cartman: I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
Kenny: (Malibu? But how?)
Liane: Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
Liane: Oh, that's great, sweetie.
Liane: Okay, hon.
Man 1: Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?
Jack: No. Actually, we're guests as well. I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise.
Elise: Hello.
Man 2: I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.
Man 2: And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.
Jack: Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?
Man 3: Oh, what a great idea! We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!
Guests: Heheh, great! Yeah! Great idea.
Cartman: Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
Ticket Salesman: We sure do!
Guests: Yeah. All right. Woohoo!
Mel: Yes?
Stan: Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.
Kenny: (Hello.)
Stan: Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
Stan: Tor- torture you?
Stan: We don't want to torture you.
Mel: I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!
Stan: Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
Stan: Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!
Father Maxi: And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins.
Kyle: Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
Father Maxi: ...What is troubling you, my child?
Kyle: Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
Father Maxi: Ah! You mean he's a Jew!
Kyle: But how can the Jews make it better??
Father Maxi: Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about atonement.
Stan and Kenny: Aaaah!
Mel: When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!
Stan: Aah! Run, dude, run!
Ticket Salesman: Woah! Great idea!
Man 3: It'll be like a parade!
Man 4: Good idea!
Elise: Well, what does that mean, dear?
Jack: Oh, I think it's Aramaic. You know, like in the movie.
Ticket Salesman: Ooo, Aramaic. Cool.
Townsfolk: Neato! That'll be awesome. Great!
Jack: What was our Aramaic line again?
Cartman: Es ist Zeit fr Rache!
Townsfolk: Wir mssen die Juden ausrotten.
Townsfolk: Wir mssen die Juden ausrotten.
Cartman: Es ist Zeit fr Rache!
Townsfolk: Wir mssen die Juden ausrotten.
Cartman: Nice.
Sheila: Whatwhatwhaaat?!
Kyle: If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
Gerald: Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!
Man 7: This proves the anti-Semitic effect that movie is having!
Man 8: Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes.
Man 9: Stereotyping Jews is terrible.
Woman 4: Something must be done to stop that movie!
Rabbi: Now, now, everyone calm down. We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie. There's no cause for alarm.
Mob: Wir mssen die Juden ausrotten!
Cartman: Es ist Zeit fr Rache!
Cartman: Es ist Zeit fr Rache!
Driver: Huh?
Stan: Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
Driver: Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games.
Driver: What the hell?
Driver: Hey! That's Mel Gibson!
Stan: Yeah. I told you that!
Driver: Well, what the hell does he want?!
Ticket Salesman: Can I help you?
Rabbi: This movie is causing anti-Semitism! You must remove it from your theater!
Congregants: That's right! Yeah! Remove your movie!
Shlomo: Remove it from the theater? Fat chance!
Man 10: We demand you stop showing it!
Congregants: Yeah! Yeah!
Jack: What's going on here?
Rabbi: This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!
Man 11: Nonsense! Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man! There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!
Elise: It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.
Rabbi: It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!
Mob: That's right! What he said.
Mel: Give me my eighteen dollars!
Ticket Salesman: That's... Mel Gibson?
Jack: H- he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.
Stan: He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
Kyle: Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
Stan: It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!
Stan: No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
Jack: You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ.
Ticket Salesman: Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times. We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
Cartman: Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
Kyle: Hey, who are those kids?
OC Girl: Aww yeah!
OC Leader: Whatchoo got, huh?! You got nothin'!
OC Leader: Damn! You just got served!
OC Leader: Aww man!
OC Girl: He got you, dude.
OC Leader: Now that kid is gettin' served!
OC Girl: Uh huh.
OC: Whoa!
Kyle: ...What the hell just happened?
Stan: Chef, we just got served.
Chef: Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa.
Kyle: Yeah.
Chef: All right. Now, where did you get served?
Stan: Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-
Sharon: Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay.
Randy: What's the matter with him?
Sharon: Oh. Stan got served at school today.
Randy: You got served? By who?
Stan: Some, kids from Orange County.
Sharon: Let's not make a big deal out of it.
Randy: So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
Stan: No.
Randy: What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?
Sharon: That was the right thing to do.
Randy: No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.
Stan: But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
Stan: But Dad-
Randy: All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.
Randy: Come on, Stan.
Randy: ...six, seven, eight.
Kyle: Dude, that is a sweet RC car!
OC Member 2: Well, what we got here?
OC Leader: You want a little more, homeboys?
Kyle: We're not interested, thanks.
Black Man: Oh Lord, look at those moves.
Black Woman: Oooo, they are takin' it out!
Black Man 2: Oh man, they are getting served!
Black Woman 2: Ooooo, it's getting hot out here!
Black Man 3: Have mercy!
Others: Oooooo, look at that! Lord! Gettin' served!
Kyle: Yeah! Go Stan!
Kyle: All right Stan!
Cartman: Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
OC Leader: Wha?
Kyle: Yeah! You got served!
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Cartman: Yeah!
Kyle: That's right!
Cartman: All right!
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
OC Leader: Okay. All right. We got served. So now, I guess... It's on.
Stan: What?
OC Member 1: This Saturday! Our top five dancers against your top five dancers! OC Convention Center. It's on!
OC Members: It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!
Chef: Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.
OC Members: Yeah, and you'd better have a lot better dancers with you than those loozas! 'Cause it's on!
OC Members: It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!
Chef: Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?
Stan: I thought I was supposed to!
Chef: Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!
Stan: But why?
Chef: Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??
Sharon: Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!
Randy: So what happened?
Sharon: It's on!
Coach: Come on now, keep it tight!
Coach: Good. Now watch that timing, drill team!
OC Member 1: All right!
OC Leader: Yeah, bad ass!
OC Member 2: Yeah, that was tight!
OC Member 1: Not bad? South Park doesn't stand a chance!
OC Girl: I heard that!
Coach: All right, it was good. But we don't want "good," we want pain!
Randy: Uh, hey, ex- excuse me.
Randy: Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm Stan Marsh's father.
Coach: Oh, so you're the father of the boy who's gonna get f'd in the a on Saturday?
OC Member 3: Dang!
OC Leader: Oooooo!
Randy: Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it- it- it's not on.
Coach: Oh, it's on!
Randy: No, no, no, it's not on.
Coach: Whoo, it's on all right!
Randy: It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.
OC Member 1: Ohhh Lord!
Randy: Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.
Skeeter: What happened to him, Doctor?
Dr. Doctor: He got served. Worst I've ever seen.
Jimbo: Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce.
Chef: Oh Lord...
Jimbo: Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?
Stan: I, I don't know. He seems all right.
Mr. Garrison: I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!
Randy: Stan? Stan?
Randy: Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.
Stan: Okay, good.
Stan: Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?
Stan: Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?
Stan: Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.
Pete: I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.
Henrietta: Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.
Firkle: I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest nonconformist of all.
Henrietta: Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.
Pete: Yeah. We just got Goth-served.
Stan: All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.
Stan: The arcade?
Stan: Dude, he's incredible.
Yao: You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do?
Stan: Yeah.
Yao: I can't dance without the machine.
Stan: It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
Yao: Okay. I'll give it a shot.
Stan: All right, that's three!
Michael: Dude, we need a girl.
Stan: Huh?
Michael: We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags.
Porsche: Hi guys, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?
Stan: Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
Stan: And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
Stan: So you'll do it?
Mercedes: Why not?
Stan: All right, we just need one more person!
Mercedes: Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing.
Stan: What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
Stan: Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...
Butters: Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-
Stan: Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.
Butters: Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
Butters: ...No.
Stan: But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.
Stan: We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
Linda: Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.
Mercedes: A tragedy?
Linda: I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go.
Stan: Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?
Yao: Hey I heard about this guy in Como who has a duck that can dance.
Stan: A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.
Stan: All right, so you're sure he can dance?
Rancher: Oh yeah. There he is. That's Jeffy.
Yao: That don't look like a dancing duck to me.
Rancher: Well, that's 'cause it needs music. Here y-here ya go, Jeffy.
Stan: Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?
Stan: My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.
Butters: Two years ago. Two years ago!
Butters: Whoops.
Woman: Paul. Paul!
Stan: Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.
Stan: We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?
Yao: What? I don't wanna get served.
Mercedes: Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served.
Butters: What do you want?
Stan: I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.
Stan: Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
Stan: Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault.
Stan: Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
Stan: Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
Butters: What?
Stan: And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
Butters: Get out of my room, Stan.
MC: Yeah, make some noise!
MC: Ladies and Gentlemen,
MC: man, you are all in for a treat! Whichever crew wins tonight, you wanna remember their faces, 'cause the next time you see them... will be in Lil Kim's next video! Give it up for Lil Kim!
Jimbo: Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.
Mr. Garrison: Aww, yeah.
MC: A'ight y'all. It's showtime!
Stan: What?
Mercedes: It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle.
Stan: What happened??
Mercedes: He was practicing the six-eight count and slipped on the floor.
OC Member 3: Come on, fools! You dancin' or what?!
Yao: Can he move it?
Stan: Aw, what do we do, Chef?!
Chef: Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit.
OC Member 1: Looks like they ain't even gonna dance.
OC Leader: They're too scared! Looks like they already got served!
Butters: Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
Chef: All right!
MC: All right come on, let's do this! DJ! Give us a hot track!
OC Member 1: Aaaah!
OC Member 3: Get out of here!
Skeeter: Woo!
Mr. Garrison: Yeah!
Jimbo: All right!
Stan: All right Butters!
Yao: You did it!
Randy: You did it, son! You did it!
Cartman: All right, Butters!
Butters: No! No! Noooooo!
Butters: What the heck?
Butters: Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.
Butters: Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package.
Cartman: I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
Cartman: Yes. I will be your new best friend.
Butters: Oh wow!
Butters: Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.
Butters: Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.
Cartman: Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
Cartman: Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
Butters: Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
Cartman: Oh, really?
Butters: Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
Cartman: Heh. Wow, that sucks.
Butters: Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
Cartman: Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
Cartman: Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
Cartman: What?
Butters: When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
Cartman: You saw that?
Butters: Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
Cartman: Nuh uh.
Butters: I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
Cartman: No way.
Butters: Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
Cartman: Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
Butters: How come?
Cartman: Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
Linda: Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.
Linda: Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.
Butters: Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.
Linda: Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?
Butters: Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?
Linda: That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?
Cartman: AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
Linda: Aw, that's just adorable.
Stephen: It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over.
Kyle: Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
Blanket: Hello!
Kyle: Hey. Do you live here?
Blanket: Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends?
Cartman: No.
Blanket: I really like your town. My dad wanted to move somewhere to get away from it all. He said he wanted peace and quiet, and to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything.
Stan: What's that you're wearing?
Blanket: It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.
Cartman: Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now.
Blanket: Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
Blanket: We have arcade games inside.
Blanket: Dad?
Stan: Whoa. Dude, no way!
Stan: Dude, are these all your toys?
Blanket: No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games.
Kyle: Dude, he just be loaded! What does he do?
Blanket: He's retired now.
Cartman: Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
Blanket: Dad? You out here?
Michael: Here I am, Blanket!
Michael: Heeee!
Michael: Jeh chabee durtah!
Michael: Blanket! Oh my beautiful blanket!
Blanket: Guys, this is my dad. Michael Ja-
Michael: Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me?
Kyle: Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.
Michael: Won't you imagine along with me?
Kyle: Mr. Jefferson?
Red: The Jeffersons?
Kyle: Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
Cartman: They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
Cartman: Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
Michael: Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!
Blanket: Who wants the first cotton candy?
Kids: Memememememememememe
Michael: Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!
Michael: Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!
Cartman: Choo-choo train! Yay!
Michael: Let's ride the train! The train!
Cartman: Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
Michael: Cartman, you have a beautiful voice.
Cartman: Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
Michael: Let's ride and ride on the train together
Cartman: ...Train together
Michael: On a journey through both of our minds.
Cartman: I've got time. Do youuu??
Kyle: Dude, what happened to your knee?
Michael: [back on the train] Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.
Cartman: Choo-choo train.
Kyle: Alright, this is gonna sting for a second.
Blanket: Ow!
Kyle: I know, I know. Be cool.
Blanket: Thank you. That already feels better.
Kyle: So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
Blanket: I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.
Blanket: I don't have a mom.
Kyle: You must have a mom.
Kyle: You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?
Blanket: No. I was made in a laboratory.
Kyle: What?
Blanket: My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home.
Kyle: So you never met your mom?
Blanket: No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts.
Kyle: Yeah. Yeah, that counts.
Cartman: Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
Kyle: You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Cartman: You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
Randy: Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.
Stan: I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.
Sharon: Oh, are they nice people?
Stan: Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
Sharon: Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.
Gerald: So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?
Michael: Kentucky, yeah.
Randy: I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
Michael: No, the- they're ignorant. That's ignorant.
Stephen: What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?
Michael: Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals
Sheila: Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.
Michael: I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child.
Randy: ....Yeeeah.
Stan: Fine, Mom.
Blanket: Wow, these are great. What are they called again?
Kyle: They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
Blanket: Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden.
Cartman: What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
Stan: No, my parents are.
Cartman: You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
Stan: What?
Cartman: Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
Gerald: Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.
Randy: Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?
Stephen: I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.
Michael: I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men.
Gerald: Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?
Michael: Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doo-doo in their souls.
Harris: Hey Sergeant, take a look at this.
Harris: Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money.
Yates: So, what's the problem?
Yates: By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.
Yates: Let's go people!
Yates: We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!
Michael: Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.
Michael: Hey!
Stan: Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
Cartman: Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
Stan: He just showed up here.
Stan: Jesus Christ!
Kyle: Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.
Kyle: He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
Stan: I know. He's here.
Kyle: What?!
Michael: Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party!
Stan: No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
Michael: We can't go home. There's a ghost in our house. Me and Blanket are scared.
Blanket: Dad says it wants to eat us.
Michael: Please don't make us go back home. Please! We're scared, we're scared!
Blanket: We're scared!
Mr. Jefferson: Hee hee!
Stan: Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
Kyle: Come on, Blanket.
Cartman: Deeper.
Cartman: Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
Michael: I think you're awesome too, Cartman.
Cartman: Yeah?
Michael: Yeah.
Cartman: Yeah?
Michael: Yeah.
Cartman: Yeah?
Stan: Ahaa!
Stan: Oh Jesus!
Murphy: I'm planting the cocaine now.
Yates: Johnson, what about you?
Yates: Frakes?
Frakes: Placing pubic hair from the raped girl now, sir.
Harris: Sir?
Yates: Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?
Harris: Oh, why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it.
Yates: Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.
Randy: Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!
Michael: Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself.
Sharon: Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?
Michael: Come on, Blanket!
Yates: Hey Har- Har- Harris! Harris!
Yates: You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!
Harris: It says right here on the final sheet he is!
Harris: It said on the final sheet!
Yates: Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.
Yates: Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?
Michael: All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore!
Stan: Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there.
Kyle: Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?
Blanket: Really? You mean it?
Stan: Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
Michael: Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!
Stan: Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
Kyle: Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!
Michael: No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look.
Michael: No, Blanket, stop!
Michael: It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!
Maggie: Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry.
Yates: I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force.
Maggie: Quitting the force? You?
Maggie: Where're you goin'?
Cartman: Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
Michael: No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!
Michael: I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!
Michael: But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!
Michael: Oh, I'm melting!
Kyle: All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.
Kenny: Yeah, sure, whatever.
Stan: You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
Kenny: Aren't I too big to be Blanket?
Stan: Blanket, you in here?
Blanket: You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Stan: All right dude, get in his bed.
Snetzl: Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl.
Yates: Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado.
Snetzl: Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?
Yates: Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson?
Snetzl: Hm. No, we never had a any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves.
Yates: Well, he doesn't really look that black.
Snetzl: Yeah, I don't, uh... Hold on a second. There was one we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial.
Yates: You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?
Snetzl: We, uhhh, found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges.
Yates: Molestation, nice.
Snetzl: Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarrassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm!
Yates: That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine.
Snetzl: Heh, yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure.
Cartman: Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
Kyle: Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us.
Michael: What are you doing with my Blanket?
Stan, Kyle, Blanket: Haaaaa!
Stan, Kyle, Blanket: Haaaaa!
Kenny: What the hell is going on, you guys?
Kenny: Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!
Kenny: Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A-
Stan: Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
Kyle: You bastard!
Stan: Run, Blanket, Run!
Michael: It's ignorant.
Cartman: Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
Kyle: Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
Blanket: Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.
Kyle: All right! Things just might work out!
Michael: Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change.
Woman: Yes?
Woman: Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?
Cartman: Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
Woman: How about fifteen dollars?
Kyle: You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
Cartman: Dude, I'm takin' a break.
Kyle: A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
Cartman: Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
Kyle: All you ever do is talk about your balls!
Kyle: If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
Cartman: Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
Stan: Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
Woman: Oh goodness, what happened?
Cartman: Shoveling accident.
Cartman: You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
Stan: Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.
Stan: Whoa.
Aaron Brown: Christina Naylon has more.
Aaron Brown: Have to interrupt you there, Christina. Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the base with breaking news. Brad?
Aaron Brown: Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He came back here for work?
Brad Morgan: Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi- his plan is to get a job here, in our time, so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account, uh, which will earn interest, and by the year 3045 be worth billions of dollars, uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundreds of dollars, but uh, enough, he says, to feed his family.
Aaron Brown: And now I understand we're going to Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation on how the time portal works. Harrison?
Stan: Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
Randy: We know, Stanley. We've been watching.
Aaron Brown: If you're just joining us, a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a one-way time portal looking for work. Uh, the President is expected to give an announcement at any time.
Sharon: There you go. All set, sweetie?
Stan: Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.
Mrs. Landis: Yes?
Stan: Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?
Mrs. Landis: Ooh, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've already hired someone else to do it.
Cartman: What?! Who?!
Mrs. Landis: One of those immigrants from the future. He said he would do it for twenty-five cents.
Kyle: Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
Stan: Son of a bitch!
Aaron Brown: Still more immigrants from the future arrived at the time border today, some even bringing their entire families. the purplish goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic side effect of the time-travel process. This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to learn even more about American life in the future. Chris Holt joins us now. Chris?
Aaron Brown: Apparently the people from the future are having a pretty easy time finding work. Since they offer to work for such low wages, they're being hired all over America.
Man 4: Well what about us in the fast-food business?! The restaurants are firing us 'cause the future people work for a lot less! They took our jobs!
Sharon: Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?
Stan: Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!
Sharon: What?!
Sharon: Who taught you to talk like that?!
Stan: Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
Randy: They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
Stan: I wanted my job!
Randy: Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!
Sharon: That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.
Stan: Timecist?
Sharon: You know, a racist, but against people from the-
Stan: People from the future. Right, got it.
Randy: All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.
Announcer: And now, here is Bill O'Reilly.
Bill O'Reilly: Welcome, welcome to the No-Spin Zone, all right? And what we're talkin' about today are the immigrants from the future. All right? Now, most people are more than happy to give a helping hand to these people who obviously need it. All right? But others are starting to say that the time portal should be closed off. All right? Now, I've got two guests with me tonight who have opposing views on the matter. On my right is pissed-off, white-trash, redneck conservative.
Darryl Weathers: Thanks for having me, Bill.
Bill O'Reilly: And on my left is aging, hippie, liberal douche.
Douche: Hello.
Bill O'Reilly: Now, pissed-off redneck, you say we shouldn't allow anyone else through the time portal, all right?
Skynard Man: They took our jobs!
Darryl Weathers: Those jobs belong to people from the present!
Bill O'Reilly: All right. What say you, aging hippie liberal douche?
Douche: Heh, it's typical for conservatives rednecks like these to view the immigrants as the problem, heh, but really, the problem is America. It is our greedy multinational corporations that keep everyone else in poverty. Your ancestors came to America as immigrants. What right do you have to turn these people away?
Bill O'Reilly: All right, redneck, your rebuttal?
Skynard Man: They took our jobs!
Herbert Garrison: All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak.
Kyle: What?!
The Kids: "Vvut."
Craig: Yeah!
Herbert Garrison: Thank you, aging, hippie, liberal douche.
Timmy: Timmih.
Man 5: This is bullcrap!
Chet: What? That's ridiculous!
Man 6: They can't do that!
Man 7: That was a good idea!
Darryl Weathers: So it appears the government ain't gonna help us! Which means we gotta take matters into our own hands! The only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening!
Man 9: Take r jurbs
Darryl Weathers: All right! So, any ideas how we can stop the future from happening?
Chet: How about we cause more global warming, so that in the future, the polar ice caps melt, and it ushers in a new ice age?
Chet: Well you know, the... global warming could bring on like a climate shift or somethin'?
Darryl Weathers: Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you know that?! Even if global warming were real, which all proven scientific data shows it isn't, it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen! You think an ice age can just happen all of a sudden-like?
Chet: Well I was just tryin' to be helpful.
Darryl Weathers: Well help yourself to a fuckin' science book, 'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard! Now, come on people, we've got to think! Damnit, they took our jaorbs!
Kyle: Aw, dude.
Cashier: Gaur da'ka?
Stan: Can you speak in present-day English please?
Cashier: Uh oh... Can I help... you?
Stan: Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.
Stan: What?!
Cashier: A cheeg- fry?
Manager: Can I help you?
Stan: I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!
Randy: Stan Marsh!
Stan: Aw- awwww!
Darryl Weathers: Come on, people, think! How are we gonna stop these immigrants from takin' our jobs!
Man 10: Hey, I got an idea. Uh maybe we should all take off all our clothes, scramble into a big pile and start gettin' gay with each other.
Chet: Did you say "get gay"?
Darryl Weathers: Hey, yeah. Well that's not a bad idea!
Man 11: What? Gettin' gay?
Darryl Weathers: Think about it: These people are from the future, right? Well, if we can git everyone to turn queer, then there won't be no children to have no children, and the people from the future won't exist to take our jobs!
Jimbo Kern: I ain't turnin' queer.
Man 2: Yeah, they took our jobs!
Stan: Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?
Boss: You'll find all the copiers and printers in the next room over and then uh-
Randy: Hey, Mr. Nelson.
Mr. Nelson: Oh... R- Randy... Uh, I'm surprised to see you here.
Randy: Why? This is my office.
Mr. Nelson: Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message? Ooh, this is awkward. Well, the thing is, Randy, you've been- replaced.
Randy: What?
Mr. Nelson: Well we found an immigrant from the future who knows geology and he offered to work for next to nothing. Uh, this is Mr. Glughgogawk.
Mr. Glughgogawk: Gheglo.
Randy: You can't be serious.
Randy: Oh my God. They took my jarb!!
Stan:: They took yer jarb!!
Announcer: This is CNN.
Aaron Brown: Breaking news at the time border. We go now live to Harrison Moore.
Man 8: Take our jobs!
Harrison Moore: Do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?
Randy: All we can do is try, Harrison.
Stan: I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.
Man 12: Yeah. We've got to start working towards a brighter tomorrow.
Randy: Well what are we waiting for?
Singer: The future begins with you and me.
Darryl Weathers: The immigrants are fadin' away!
Stan: We're doing it!
Cartman: Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
Darryl Weathers: Back in the pile everyone!
Randy: We're going back to the pile.
Man 13: Jump in!
Man 14: Come on, everybody!
Man 15: Never mind, we're going back to the pile!
Man 16: Took yer jurb!
Red: Hey, South Park! Do you have school spirit?
Butters: It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
Herbert Garrison: Oh, Jesus, not PETA again.
Gas Mask PETA Member: The cow is a slave! The cow is a commodity! To be thrown away by a society gone wrong!
Class: Awwwwwwww!
Stan: But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
Dreadlocked PETA man: You're responsible for the enslavement and genocide of millions!
Dreadlocked PETA man: Who'll speak for those who cannot speak for themselves?!
Stan: This is bullcrap, dude!
Herbert Garrison: Now children, it's not that bad. There's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians...
Wendy: But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?
Herbert Garrison: No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people.
Cartman: Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
Kyle: Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."
Cartman: Ye-heah!
Kenny: (Yeah, totally awesome!)
Cartman: Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich."
Kyle: Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.
Cartman: It is not!
Kyle: Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?
Kenny: (Giant douche.)
Cartman: Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
Kyle: Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?
Butters: Huh?
Butters: Hahaha, a turd sandwich!
Kyle: You misled him, fatass!
Cartman: It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
Kyle: Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.
Jimmy: That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea.
Kyle: A giant douche.
Jimmy: Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?
Cartman: A turd sandwich.
Kyle: Giant douche.
Cartman: Turd sandwich.
Kyle: A giant douche.
Cartman: Turd sandwich.
Cartman: Awwwww!
Butters: Ohhh, we lost?
Kyle: All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."
Cartman: Okay. You win, Kyle.
Kyle, Kenny: Go, giant douche!
Cartman: All right turd sandwich!
Butters: Yeah!
Kyle: Cartman? What the hell?!
Cartman: Giant Douche sucks!
Herbert Garrison: Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.
Kyle: You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
Cartman: Game on, Jew-boy!
Kyle: Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.
Kenny: (Giant Douche! Vote for him!)
Kyle: Giant Douche is your man!
Kyle: There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
Stan: I'm not voting!
Kyle: Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Sharon: How was school today, Stanley?
Stan: It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Sharon: ...What did you say?
Randy: Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
Stan: No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
Sharon: Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!
Stan: Mom, I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
Sharon: Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.
Randy: You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
Sharon: It's sexist, is what it is!
Randy: You don't understand the issues, Sharon!
Sharon: Are you calling me ignorant?!
Randy: You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
Stan: Puff Daddy?
Puff Daddy: Your friend Kyle told me you don't understand the importance of voting.
Stan: I...
Stan: Aaaah!
Stan: ...Okay. I'll vote.
Clyde: What do you guys want?
Cartman: We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
Clyde: I haven't decided yet.
Cartman: Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
Butters: Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
Cartman: So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?
Kyle: You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?
Kyle: Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.
Kyle: Woah... wait, what are you doing?
Stan: I'm voting.
Kyle: No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.
Stan: Yeah, I know.
Kyle: ...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.
Kyle: Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!
Stan: Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!
Principal Victoria: We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him.
Randy: Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!
Stan: The whole thing is a joke!
Sharon: You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.
Principal Victoria: Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed.
Randy: Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!
Principal Victoria: No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible.
Randy: Expulsion?!
Principal Victoria: No. Banishment.
Stan: B-bani-banishment?
Principal Victoria: You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.
Stan: You-you're all joking, right?
Randy: This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.
Stan: Dad, isn't this a little extreme?
Bearded PETA Member: Look! What is that?
Blonde PETA Member 2: Oh, the poor thing!
Blonde PETA Member 2: Don't worry, we'll free you.
Bearded PETA Member: Just sit still for a moment.
Stan: Oh, thank God.
Blonde PETA Member 2: Poor thing needs water.
Bearded PETA Member: You're safe now.
Stan: Awww!
Blonde PETA Member 2: Come, you can live with us.
Bearded PETA Member: We will give you food and shelter.
Stan: What about me?
Bearded PETA Member: The... kid wants to stay, too.
Stan: I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
Stan: Wow, you guys really love animals.
Ostrich-baby: Kill me...
Stan: I'll live with you.
Stan: He said I can stay.
Announcer: This is Debate 2004 with your host, Jim Lehrer.
Giant Douche: Jim, first of all I would like to thank you for monitoring this debate. And I would like to thank all of the students and their parents for coming.
Giant Douche: But I would hope that those students and their parents who question my qualities would simply look at my opponent. He is a turd sandwich
Turd Sandwich: I-I'm sorry, Jim.
Giant Douche: Anyway, as I was saying, ahh... wait, I-I forgot what I was saying.
Turd Sandwich: Ha. What a douche.
Jim Lehrer: All right, Turd Sandwich, this next question is for you. How should South Park Elementary enforce its laws of conduct for young athletes during sporting events.
Jim Lehrer: Your time is up, Turd.
Stan: Ahh, no thanks, that's okay.
Balding Man: Stan, some PETA members are growing concerned that maybe you don't love animals.
Balding Man: You... don't belong here, Stan. You should return home.
Stan: I can't. I was banished for not voting.
Balding Man: But, why on earth wouldn't you wanna vote?
Stan: I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Bodyguard: Vote or die!
Mr. Mackey: M'kay... that's one more vote for Turd Sandwich.
Mr. Mackey: It's pretty close, but it looks like Giant Douche is gonna win.
Cartman: Oh, no! Noooo!!
Kyle: Ha! You lose, fatass!
Randy: Stan!
Sharon: Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?
Stan: I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
Randy: He's going to vote!
Some Townsfolk: Yeah! All right!
Other Townsfolk: Aawwww!
Stan: Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
Randy: Hey! That's not true, Stan.
Mr. Mackey: What the? They're all dead? Well, that means...
All: Hooray! All right!
Cartman: You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
Stan: ...What?
Kyle: That is fucking stupid, Cartman!
Stan: It's time for what?
Cartman: Whoa, awesome!
Kyle: Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
Man: Yeah! Now it's a Wall-Mart!
Randy: It's beautiful!
Sheila: Sharon, isn't that your father?
Sharon: Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.
Kyle: Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
Cartman: Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
Kyle: You only need one copy, r-tard!
Cartman: Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
Stan: Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
Randy: It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.
Whispers: Six ninety-nine, fifteen dollars, free for fifteen ninety-eight...
Sharon: Randy, what are you doing?!
Sharon: It's almost midnight.
Cartman: Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
Mr. Farkle: Oh, sorry boys. I'm going out of business.
Kyle: Why, Mr. Farkle?
Cartman: What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
Kyle: See?! That sucks, dude!
Cartman: What? That's called progress, Kyle.
Kyle: Butters? What the hell are you doing?
Stan: Dad, oh my God!
Randy: Staan...
Stan: What? D-dad, are are you dying?
Randy: No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.
Stan: But you-your face!
Chef: Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore.
Randy: We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.
Chef: They why don't you just quit?!
Randy: Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.
Sharon: Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them.
Stan: Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
Shelly: Oh, you stupid turd!
Randy: Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!
Sharon: We do?
Randy: Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!
Stan: But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-
Gerald: Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?
Herbert Garrison: Well what are you doing here, Randy?
Randy: I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
Stan: Dad!
Gerald: Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here.
Jimbo: It's like some mystical evil force.
Randy: Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!
Herbert Garrison: Let's burn it down!
Stephen: I think it's best we try to reason with it.
Kyle: No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.
All: Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. Kumbaya, my Lord...
Cartman: You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
Gerald: We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.
Stan: Dad, what are you doing?!
Randy: You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.
Stan: Dad, you're a geologist!
Randy: I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.
Driver: Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.
Kyle: But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!
Driver: You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups.
Stan: Where are they?
Kyle: Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!
Stan: Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.
Kyle: No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
Cartman: Nuh-uh.
Kyle: Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha! I was working for Wall-Mart all along!" or something.
Cartman: I am not, Kyle!
Cartman: You heard what?
Kyle: You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
Stan: Dude, come on!
Kyle: He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
Stan: Dude, we have to go!
Stan: Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!
Stan: Goddamn, that took a long time.
Kyle: It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
Receptionist: Can I help you?
Kyle: Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
Receptionist: Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall-Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it.
Kyle: We want to talk to who's in charge.
Receptionist: In charge? I guess that would be Harvey Brown. He's the current president of Wall-Mart. One of the original creators.
Stan: Where's he?
Kyle: So how do we stop it?
Stan: There has to be a way!
Harvey Brown: There's nothing! Don't you understand?! Nothing can stop the Wall-Mart in your town! ...Unless... of course, you can find and destroy its heart.
Kyle: The heart of Wall-Mart?
Cartman: Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
Harvey Brown: Every Wall-Mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. Destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process!
Cartman: You speak too much, sir!
Stan: Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
Harvey Brown: Because the Wall-Mart stops you. Many have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature activists, even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the Wall-Mart and now. They are Wall-Mart shoppers all.
Kyle: All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.
Kyle: I knew you were!
Cartman: No, you didn't.
Kyle: Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!
Cartman: No, you didn't.
Kyle: Yes, I did!
Cartman: No, you didn't.
Kyle: Yes, I did!
Cartman: No, you didn't.
Kyle: Yes, I did!
Cartman: No, you didn't.
Cartman: ...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
Marvin Marsh: Welcome to Wall-Mart.
Stan: Save it, Grandpa!
Randy: Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.
Stan: Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
Randy: Shhhhh! What are you talking about?
Stan: One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
Stan: What?!
Randy: Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!
Kyle: I think I see the television department in the back!
Randy: The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight!
Stan: Come on, Dad!
Randy: I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!
Stan: No, dad! We need your keys!
Kyle: Who are you?
Stan: You?
Stan: We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
Kyle: Where's the heart?
Stan: Me. I'm asking the question.
Wall-Mart: Ah, yes, but who are you?
Stan: Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?
Wall-Mart: Ah. You know the answer, but not the question!
Kyle: The question is, "Where is the heart?"
Stan: It's a mirror.
Wall-Mart: Yes, don't you see? That is the heart of Wall-Mart. You, the consumer. I take may forms: Wall-Mart, K-Mart, Target. But I am one single entity: Desire!
Stan: Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!
Randy: Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!
Gerald: How did you do it, Kyle?
Kyle: All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
Randy: Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
Kyle: Duh.
Randy: You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?
Crowd: ...Oh Lord, Kumbaya.
Randy: All right, let's not make that mistake again.
Herbert Garrison: Yeah, lets all shop over at True Value!
Stan: Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
Kyle: Okay, hang on a second I-
Kenny: (WHAT??!!!?)
Kyle: Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?!
Stan: Yeah! He just got paroled!
Kyle: Oh, no! No!
Cartman: Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
Kyle: Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
Kyle: Yeah.
Cartman: Oh, Holy Jesus, God...
Stan: What the hell are we gonna do??
Cartman: It's true.
Cartman: He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
Kyle: Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool
Toddler Stan: Dude, let's play Fireman.
Toddler Kyle: Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.
Toddler Kyle: Shut up, fat ass!
Toddler Cartman: Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!
Toddler Cartman: But how do we start a fire?
Trent: Say Uncle!
Boy: Uncle!
Kyle: Do you know how to start a fire?
Trent: Sure! I burn lots stuff.
Stan: Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
Kyle: We're firemen!
Trent: Do you fuckheads even know how to put out a fire?
Stan: Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
Cartman: Don't worry, Trent.
Cartman: Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
Stan: Wow, cool!
Kyle: Code 7! Bring in the firemen!
Stan: We're heroes!
Trent: They said they could put it out!
Stan: Dude, we are in so much trouble!
Kyle: My mom is gonna break my legs!
Cartman: Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
Stan: That's true.
Stan: No!
Kyle: Not us. We're good kids.
Trent: Tell them it was an accident: you thought you could put it out.
Cartman: Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
Officer: I thought so. All right, that's it, Trent. You're going to Juvenile Hall for a long time!
Butters: U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.
Kyle: Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
Cartman: Whatever. That's like five years from now.
Stan: Yeah, who cares?
Stan: Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
Cartman: Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
Kyle: We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!
Cartman: You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
Kyle: Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.
Butters: Hwell. Oh, uh, hi Dad.
Stephen: Butters, what is wrong with you??
Butters: Nothins' wrong, sir. Eh, nothin' at all.
Linda: You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play.
Linda: Why not?
Stephen: Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now!
Butters: But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
Linda: What on earth is the matter with him?
Stephen: Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life.
Butters: Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!
Trent: Can you give me back my time?! Huh?! Can you do that?! Kindergarten, first grade, second?! Can you give me that?!
Butters: Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.
Trent: I'm gonna give you something you didn't give me: a five-second head-start.
Butters: No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.
Trent: Four seconds!
Butters: Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-
Trent: Three seconds!
Stephen: What happened to him, Doctor?
Linda: What's that?
Dr. Doctor: We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure.
Cartman: We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
Kyle: That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
Cartman: Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
Stan: Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
Kyle: Dude, we shouldn't be here!
Stan: Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.
Stan: We've come to... ask you for help.
Kyle: We need you to protect us... from a bully.
Sixth Grade Leader: You're Stan Marsh, right?
Stan: Yeah.
Sixth Graders: Yeah. Awesome.
Stan: What?!
Sixth Grader 3: Yeah! I totally wanna suck your mom's tits.
Stan: Dude, weak!
Sixth Grade Leader: Come back with a naked picture of your mom!
Sixth Grade Leader: Then we aren't helpin' you!
Kyle: Wait! We'll do it.
Cartman: Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
Trent: Can Kyle come out and play?
Sheila: Oh, Kyle isn't home right now, hon.
Stan: You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
Stan: But mom, my teacher will-
Stan: This is hopeless!
Kyle: Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
Stan: That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!
Cartman: Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my ass cheeks.
Cartman: Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.
Stan: How do you know?!
Cartman: Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
Kyle: Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.
Stan: Excuse me!
Sixth Grade Leader: What do you want now?!
Sixth Grader 5: No way!
Sixth Grader 8: Whoa!
Sixth Grader 4: Check them out!
Sixth Graders: Yeah. Sure does. Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
Cartman: All right!
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Cartman: You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
Kenny: (All right!)
Sixth Grader 9: I need three minutes alone with the picture behind the bushes.
Sixth Grader 2: I get to take the picture behind the bushes after you.
Stan: Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
Kyle: Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!
Cartman: Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
Nurse 1: Doctor, we have another snuggie here!
Nurse 2: Worst one yet.
Stan: Dude, what happened?
Sixth Grade Leader: We... told him not to mess with you guys... We told him... you paid us.
Dr. Doctor: Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl.
Stan: What's that?
Stan: We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
Kyle: We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
Stan: No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
Kyle: From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
Stan: Shelly?
Shelly: Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!
Stan: Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.
Shelly: I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!
Stan: Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.
Shelly: Oh, you are such stupid turds.
Stan: We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!
Shelly: Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job.
Kyle: So you're gonna help us?
Shelly: Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.
Cartman: A picture of your mom's boobs?
Stan: Admit it was our fault?
Kyle: The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
Cartman: A lot of stupid things that we regret.
Stan: See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."
Cartman: Aaaaaaaah!
Cartman: Stay away from us, Trent!
Stan: What is that?
Trent: Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with.
Officer 2: So, Trent, you just had to finish off your old preschool teacher, eh?
Cartman: Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
Cartman: Whatever, that's like five years from now.
Stan: Yeah, who cares?
The Boys: Yeah, woohoo!
Sixth Grader 2: Hey, hold on a second!
Cartman: Uh oh.
Sixth Grader 1: Omigod!
Sixth Graders: Boobs!
Sixth Grader 2: I'm taking them to the bushes first!
Cartman: Hah! Hey!
Announcer: This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now, Super School News. The news made for students, by students.
Jimmy: Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.
Cartman: And I'm Rick Cartman.
Jimmy: The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County.
Cartman: Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
Butters: Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
Cartman: All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
Jimmy: More snow for South P... P-P-Park. Here's Token Black with the weather.
Cartman: Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
Cartman: Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
Stan: Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
Kyle: What?!
Jimmy: For God's sake,why Mr. M-M-Meryl?!
Mr. Meryl: Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week.
Cartman: How many students is that?
Stan: ...Craig's show??
Cartman: What is that butthole doing now?!
Stan: But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
Mr. Meryl: Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens!
Cartman: Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
Cartman: ...You're gay!
Stan: Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
Cartman: Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
Bradley: Yeah!
Kid 1: Hey look, it's Craig!
Kevin: Hey, Craig, over here!
Kyle: Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
Cartman: Go play with yourself, Craig.
Craig: Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Kenny: (Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)
Bebe: Come on, Wendy, we're gonna miss it!
Wendy: We're gonna miss what?
Bebe: Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall!
Wendy: Who's Paris Hilton?
Red: "Who's Paris Hilton?"
Annie: You don't know?
Bebe: Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here!
Wendy: I don't get it. What's she do?
Annie: She's super-rich!
Red: She's totally spoiled and snobby.
Bebe: Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls.
Wendy: You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?
Wendy: But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!
Annie: Wow, you really sound like a dumb brat, Bebe.
Paris: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Chauffeur: Oh dear...
Paris: Another dog killed itself!
Jessie: Sure, Wendy. We were just trying to think of something to do.
Wendy: Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?
Jessie: Nah, that sounds really dull.
Wendy: What?!
Kal: You can make videos that get out on the Internet!
Kal: I'm pretending to be calling my friends on the cellphone while my man waits for more sex!
Paris: Bwaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaa!
Chauffeur: All right, Ms. Hilton, we'll find you another dog.
Driver: There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we?
Butters: My name's Butters.
Chauffeur: Paris, I believe this is somebody's child.
Paris: I want it!
Chauffeur: I don't think you can actually-
Chauffeur: All right, all right, come on- come on, young man.
Butters: Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."
Stephen: Butters, never get into a car with a stranger! Unless it's a limousine.
Butters: Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
Mr. Testaburger: Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?
Wendy: Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society.
Mr. Testaburger: Oh?
Wendy: It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon.
Mr. Testaburger: ...Gosh.
Wendy: I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.
Females: Yeah! Right!
Females: Yeah! Right! It isn't fair!
Teen Girl 1: All the girls in South Park are gonna be total sluts from now on, so you can just get used to it.
Wendy: Dad!
Females: Hooray!
Stephen: Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?!
Stephen: Your girlfriend?
Linda: Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton? You are grounded, mister!
Butters: I'm sorry.
Linda: Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age!
Stephen: So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels.
Paris: I've gotta get outta here. This place is stupid. Where am I? Oh, I wanna take Mr. Biggles with me.
Paris: To live with me forever and ever, you dumb broad. How much?
Linda: How much? For Butters?
Stephen: Butters is our son. He's not for sale.
Stephen: Excuse me?!
Linda: Chris, is she serious?
Stephen: Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk.
Stephen: Butters, right now!
Linda: We aren't honestly considering this?
Linda: But he's our son!
Stephen: I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family.
Linda: The rest of the f- you do mean us?
Stephen: Yes, us, the rest of the family.
Wendy: Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight.
Bebe: You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.
Annie: Right. Please, Wendy, you're like Class President and stuff!
Red: Yeah, and you get straight A's in school!
Bebe: You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!
Wendy: That's okay.
Annie: Oh, please, do you even know what ketamine is?
Wendy: Yes.
Red: Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is.
Bebe: Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!
Red: Hey, we'd better start inviting boys to the party.
Sally Turner: Oooo, look, here comes Clyde.
Millie: Mmm, I'd like a piece of that!
Red: I wanna do him.
Millie: I'd like to twizel his pixie stick.
Bebe: Party at my house tonight, Kyle.
Red: Yeah, they're invited too.
Sally: Jason has a huge bulge. You're gonna get it, boys.
Millie: Yeah, I'd like to wax his crankshaft!
Bebe: Hey Kevin, party at my house.
Millie: I'd like to gargle his marbles.
Stephen: Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton.
Butters: Oh hamburgers!
Paris: Yay! Mr. Biggles, you're mine forever!
Stephen: All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay.
Butters: Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
Stephen: It's called "working" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!
Cartman: Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
Red: Kelly who?
Cartman: Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
Red: Did you invite him?
Cartman: Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?
Herbert Garrison: Oh, hello Wendy. Are you all right?
Wendy: No, I need help.
Herbert Garrison: F-from from me?
Wendy: Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend.
Mr. Slave: Oooooooooooh! Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ!
Herbert Garrison: Mr. Slave, little Wendy from class wants to see you.
Mr. Slave: Oh, Hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework?
Wendy: No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you
Herbert Garrison: ...Oh dear. Mr. Slave, I think you and Wendy better have a little talk. I'll make some cocoa.
Wendy: Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know.
Mr. Slave: Thank you sweetie.
Wendy: Can you teach me your secret fast?
Mr. Slave: As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough.
Boy Slave: Oooooooooooh! Oooooooooooh! Jesus Christ!
Mr. Slave: So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway?
Wendy: Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.
Mr. Slave: A what?! For God's sake, where?!
Man: Look at that. A bear, mining for coal.
Stephen: Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal?
Butters: Well, no, not quite.
Linda: Bye, sweetie, we love you!
Chris: Oh that trouble making son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister!
Annie: Ew, party foul!
Red: Shut off the light.
Stan: Oh, thank God.
Mr. Slave: Girls, what on earth are you doing?
Bebe: What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!
Mr. Slave: Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!
Paris: Who the fuck are you calling a lowlife?!
Bebe: Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!
Mr. Slave: Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing.
Paris: What isn't great about it? What's more to life than partying?
Mr. Slave: Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life.
Mr. Slave: Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay?
Paris: Oh I went there. I went there, took some pictures, and flew back already.
Girls: Ooooo!
Mr. Slave: Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some "partying" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great.
Paris: Oh yeah?! I challenge you to a whore-off!
Girls: Ooooo!
Bebe: Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.
Red: Paris is gonna rock his world.
Official: Ah, I'm... not quite sure how we... start this competition off, but uh-
Bebe: Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all.
Bebe: Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.
Red: Yeah, and I didn't mean to say you weren't a whore.
Stephen: So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!
Stephen: You're a grounded old bear.
Frog King: Paris, you must find the way out of this place or you'll surely die.
Paris: What?
Clyde: I don't know, that looks pretty high up.
Butters: Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
Cartman: This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
Stan: It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
Kyle: Do it! Do it!
Cartman: I'm gonna!
Craig: I wouldn't if I were you.
Token: Those wings don't look very strong.
Kyle: Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
Kyle: Awww, go on and do it already!
Cartman: Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
Dr. Doctor: I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma.
Liane: Coma... My God, fo- for how long?
Cartman: Wheh? Where am I?
Liane: Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!
Dr. Doctor: You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time.
Cartman: Coma... How long?
Dr. Doctor: It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now.
Liane: You're doing so much better, muffin.
Cartman: Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
Liane: Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.
Yates: Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore.
Murphy: We'd better get back to the station, sir.
Cartman: Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
Yates: All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?
Cartman: Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!
Dr. Doctor: Yes, it was pretty severe.
Murphy: What is it, Lou?
Yates: I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.
Murphy: Aw, come on, sir.
Cartman: Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
Yates: Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?
Murphy: Jesus, how did he...?
Liane: His new... powers?
Officer 1: Who's the kid?
Officer 2: He's supposed to be some kind of psychic.
Officer 1: Aw, Christ!
Cartman: How come the outline is missing its hand?
Yates: Jesus Christ!
Murphy: Sir?
Yates: Tom Johansen, the owner of the ice cream shop!
Tom Johansen: Yes? Oh, hello, detectives.
Yates: Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you?
Officer 3: He put up a hell of a fight, but we got him!
Yates: Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history.
Murphy: We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the people of South Park are safe again is reward enough.
Cartman: Guess again.
Cartman: Wow!
Liane: Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.
Kyle: Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
Cartman: Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
Kyle: Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!
Cartman: Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
Kyle: You don't have any powers!
Cartman: Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
Butters: Wuh be careful, Kyle.
Kyle: He can't do crap!
Cartman: What?
Yates: While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed.
Yates: Which can only mean one thing!
Kyle: Ha! You see?!
Yates: That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!
Kyle: What?!
Murphy: We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again.
Cartman: I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
Kyle: This is fuckin' ridiculous!
Lou: Whattaya got, wunderkind? Are ya seeing anything?
Cartman: No. Nothing.
Officer 5: Maybe his powers have left him.
Officer 6: Yeah.
Kyle: What the hell is wrong with these people?!
Kyle: Hey! What about this guy?!
Murphy: Quiet! He's havin' a vision!
Kyle: Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!
Lou: I said quiet, you little brat, or I'll have you arrested for interfering with the law!
Announcer: This is Park County News 4, with your host, Jim Brown-ish
Jim Brown-ish: The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand killer has been arrested. Police used the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immediately arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help.
Liane: Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.
Cartman: More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
Female Psychic: So, you are the little boy who's been taking all our work?!
Liane: Oooh, I'll go make some tea.
Other psychics: Yeah!
Cartman: Proper channels?
Cartman: I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
Female Psychic: Very well, then you give us no choice. Roger?
Liane: Oh, goodness! What's going on?
Cartman: Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
Cartman: In court?
Yates: Jesus Christ! Cause of death?
Murphy: Same M.O., sir. Multiple stab wounds, left hand cut off and missing.
Kyle: No.
Kyle: Why won't anybody listen to me?!
Stan: Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!
Token: There has to be another way!
Kyle: Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
Butters: Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.
Michael Deets: You. You give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness.
Cartman: ... 'Kay. Sweet.
Michael Deets: Because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds.
Cartman: Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!
Michael Deets: You are obviously a big fan of my work.
Cartman: I don't even know you dude!
Michael Deets: But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful place in history you have smirched!
Cartman: Oh, Jesus.
Michael Deets: And now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim.
Cartman: No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
Michael Deets: Do you see?!
Cartman: AAAAAAAH!
Female Detective: Sorry, Sarge, the psychic's mom says her son hasn't been home for a couple of hours.
Officer 7: Sir! Dr. Kels just called from the hospital! He says another little boy just awoke from a coma, and is having psychic visions!
Yates: Doctor, could you remove his face warmer? We'd like to speak with him.
Yates: Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder?
Yates: What do you think, Mitch?
Yates: All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use.
Murphy: ...Sir?
Yates: You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use?
Murphy: ...Restraint?
Yates: Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr...
Michael Deets: God.
Cartman: (Hey! Come over here!)
Yates: I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that, too.
Murphy: Sir?
Yates: This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands.
Murphy: Right.
Murphy: Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall. Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer.
Murphy: Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir? Uh, for the serial killer?
Cartman: No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
Michael Deets: Your hand will be one with the others.
Cartman: You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
Yates: Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail.
Tom Johansen: Yes, thank you very much, Kyle.
Female Psychic: Yes, thanks.
Murphy: You're certainly a better psychic then Eric.
Murphy: Do you think that's true?
Cartman: You can't hurt me.
Narrator: ...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas Day.
Rabbity: Well, hello there. Welcome to our forest.
Skunky: How do you like our Christmas tree?
Stan: It's... nice.
Mousey: Oh no, I see a problem.
Deery: What is it, Mousey?
Mousey: Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star.
Critters: Awww.
Beary: We can't have a tree with no star on it.
Rabbity: What are we gonna do?
Squirrely: Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star.
Stan: Okay, okay.
Critters: Ohhhh!
Beary: It's the nicest star I ever saw.
Narrator: The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile...
Beavery: How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while?
Narrator: The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said...
Beavery: Goo- goodbye Stanny!
Critters: Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat!
Stan: Woof.
Critters: Hi, Stanny!
Squirrely: You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!
Skunky: Porcupiney is pregnant!
Mousey: I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization.
Deery: Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her conception was immaculate.
Foxy: She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior.
Stan: ...What?
Porcupiney: It has been foretold unto me that I would give birth on Christmas Day.
Mousey: So soon!
Skunky: How delightful!
Woodpeckery: Our souls are saved!
Critters: Awwww.
Beary: But we got to have a manger.
Rabbity: Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us a manger? Huh?
Critters: (Cheers)
Rabbity: Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger I ever saw.
Mousey: I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place, for the Son of our Lord.
Raccoony: Does this mean we can go to sleep now?
Porcupiney: My son will have the nicest bed in all the forest.
Woodpeckery: Fit for a king!
Squirrely: This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever!
Squirrely: Is it gone?
Mousey: I deduce it is.
Foxy: Well, this is the end. The mountain lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant, and he's gonna kill it again.
Stan: Again?
Squirrely: Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.
Porcupiney: Oh dear, I'm so very afraid.
Squirrely: Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny!
Raccoony: Of course! Stanny can do anything! If he can build a manger, he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion!
Stan: Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!
Narrator: Said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
Beary: You all right, Lady Porcupiney?
Porcupiney: Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all.
Beavery: Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead.
Foxy: Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole.
Rabbity: I guess that means our Savior is gonna be made into Savior stew.
Critters: Awwww.
Mousey: Stanny, you're alive.
Beary: But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion?
Stan: It's dead.
Deery: For real and for true?
Beavery: Are you sure?
Stan: I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
Squirrely: He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!
Critters: Hail Satan!
Stan: Wait, wha-what?
Beavery: You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist!
Stan: Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
Squirrely: Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness.
Stan: But I thought you meant the Son of God!
Deery: Well, think about it: You really think God would have sex with a porcupine?
Chickadee-y: No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness and King of all Evil would do that! Yay!
Foxy: This just calls for a celebration! Let's sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!
Rabbity: Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!
Chickadee-y: Drink his blood! Drink his blood!
Critters: Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay!
Stan: Ugh.
Stan: Uuugh!
Narrator: He knew that only by going to the forest could he --
Woodpeckery: Oh boy, Stanny. You came just in time!
Deery: Yeah. We've got a big problem.
Squirrely: The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into.
Chickadee-y: That way he could take over the whole world! The whole world!
Mousey: The human must be non-baptized and heathenistic against Christ.
Beavery: We figured you'd be perfect!
Critters: Yay!
Stan: I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
Critters: Awwwww.
Beary: But we got to have a human host body for the Antichrist.
Deery: Oh dear, maybe we won't have a critter C-Christmas after all.
Squirrely: Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human.
Chickadee-y: Will you really, Stanny?
Beavery: To stop us?
Beary: But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop us, we'd have to use our evil Satanic powers on ya.
Beary: Oh boy! Our Satanic powers sure did the trick!
Chickadee-y: Our powers get stronger every day! Get stronger every day!
Squirrely: Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion.
Skunky: And you got rid of her.
Critters: Yay!
Stan: Oh yeah.
Lion Cub 3: Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy!
Lion Cub 1: He's come to kill us now!
Lion Cub 2: It's okay. I died inside when Mommy was killed anyways.
Lion Cub 3: Yeah, better this than the slow death we'd face without a mother around.
Stan: Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
Lion Cub 1: You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee, you're not too smart, are you, mister?
Stan: I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!
Lion Cub 3: Yeah, and you killed her.
Stan: Well, you're mountain lions.
Lion Cub 2: Us? No, we're just kids. We still have our baby teeth.
Lion Cub 1: And our baby claws.
Lion Cub 3: And a dead mom.
Stan: There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
Lion Cub 3: What? You mean like in an abortion?
Lion Cub 2: Yeah. An abortion. That can work.
Lion Cub 1: But, we don't know how to give abortions.
Lion Cub 3: Do you know some place we can learn, mister?
Stan: No, he didn't.
Narrator: Yes, he did.
Stan: No, he didn't!
Narrator: Yes, he did.
Stan: No, he didn't!
Narrator: Said the boy in the red poofball hat! "We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!"
Narrator: The abortion doctor inquired.
Doctor: If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required!
Stan: I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
Stan: This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.
Beary: Oh look. That little feller is all alone.
Critters: Hi there!
Beavery: How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.
Kyle: My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
Raccoony: Aww, but why?
Kyle: Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.
Beary: But does that mean you aren't baptized?
Kyle: No. I'm Jewish.
Beavery: You've got to come with us!
Deery: You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!
Kyle: Huh?
Stan: Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?
Lion Cub 3: Sure. We know how to give abortions now.
Beavery: Gosh, we did it!
Stan: Too late?! The hell is that?!
Beavery: Oh. Hiya, Stanny!
Stan: It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!
Skunky: Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist into our human host.
Critters: Let's go! All right! Woohoo!
Beavery: Wow, look, there's Santy Claus!
Raccoony: We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the Antichrist with help from our good friend, Stanny.
Skunky: Death and pain await all living things.
Santa: Little boy, you should be ashamed!
Stan: I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
Singers: Hold steady, Santa.
Santa: Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into.
Stan: What?! Kyle?!
Stan: Dude!
Kyle: Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
Kyle: This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
Cartman: Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
Mr. Garrison: Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.
Butters: Well but, but what happened?
Token: Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?
Clyde: What happens to the lion cubs?
Cartman: Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
Stan: No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
Kyle: Dude, why do you care?!
Stan: Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
Kyle: Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
Cartman: That's not at all what happens.
Butters: Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.
Kyle: All right, fine!
Stan: Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
Stan: No Santa, don't!
Santa: We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul.
Stan: The lion cubs!
Narrator: The little boy quickly begun,
Stan: I took them to see how abortions are done.
Santa: What?
Kyle: Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.
Mother Lion: Wha -- Oh my, what happened?
The Cubs: Yay! You're back! We missed you, Mommy!
Doctor: Hello, Mr. Garrison, I'm Dr. Biber. I'll be performing your surgery today.
Dr. Biber: Now, you're absolutely sure you want a vaginoplasty?
Mr. Garrison: My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness.
Dr. Biber: With the scrotum open, I can now discard of your testicles.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, that stings.
Dr. Biber: Now I'll just... turn your... penis inside out.
Mr. Garrison: OH! Oh jeez.
Dr. Biber: All we need to do now is ...stuff the ...unskinned penis inside your... pelvis... And now I'll use the skin from your penis to make vaginal lips.
Mr. Garrison: Do I look like a woman?
Stan: Dude, don't be nervous.
Kyle: How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
Stan: You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.
Cartman: This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.
Kyle: Yeah?
Kyle: Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
Coach: Yeah. Uh, look, kid, you've got great skills and a great attitude. But you're just not physically ...built for the game.
Kyle: Oo whataya mean?
Kyle: I know. I deserve it.
Cartman: Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!
Randy: Believe what?
Stan: Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.
Cartman: You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.
Kyle: Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?
Kyle: But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
Ike: Penis!
Ike: Vagina!
Sheila: Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.
Gerald: He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!
Kyle: Yeah. That's right.
Kyle: Totally! I totally understand!
Sheila: There. You see, Gerald? He totally understands.
Dr. Biber: So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive surgery.
Kyle: Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
Dr. Biber: Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had a vaginoplasty. Mhm.
Kyle: Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
Dr. Biber: Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants to be a man. That procedure is called a peniplasty.
Kyle: No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.
Dr. Biber: ...You what?
Kyle: I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
Stan: Wha-a-a negroplasty??
Stan: Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?
Dr. Biber: Well, it's a good idea if you wanna be tall and black. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.
Mr. Slave: No thanks.
Mr. Slave: I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought.
Mrs. Garrison: Well, I ASSUMED you supported me. It's still me; I just have a vagina instead of a penis.
Mr. Slave: But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas!
Mrs. Garrison: Don't you even care that I was suffering? I wasn't happy the way I was!
Mr. Slave: It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel!
Mrs. Garrison: Look, we can still be together. All you have to do is stop being gay!
Mr. Slave: How can you say that?! You're gay too!
Mrs. Garrison: I'm not gay! I'm a woman!
Sheila: What??
Gerald: Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!
Sheila: Absolutely not, Kyle!
Sheila: Yes, but Kyle-
Sheila: Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.
Kyle: Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
Sheila: The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!
Gerald: Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!
Sheila: Where are you going?!
Gerald: Who the hell do you think you are?!
Dr. Biber: Dr. Biber.
Gerald: What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!
Gerald: Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!
Dr. Biber: What is that on your shirt?
Gerald: What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins! Why?
Gerald: A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-
Dr. Biber: I can make you one.
Gerald: ...What?
Dr. Biber: Invert the back, move the esophagus to the top of the head. Yes, a full dolphinoplasty could be achieved relatively simply...
Dr. Biber: There's nothing crazy about a person wanting to look on the outside the way they feel on the inside.
Men: Awww!
Redhead: Well, normally, if a woman misses her period, it means she's pregnant.
Sheila: A dolphin?!?!
Butters: Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!
Stan: What?
Jason: Wow.
Craig: Can't believe it.
Clyde: Did it hurt?
Stan: Jesus Christ, dude!
Kyle: Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
Stan: Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?
Nurse: Mrs... Garrison?
Doctor: ...an abortion?
Doctor: Mmister Garrison-
Doctor: Mmrs. Garrison, you can't have an abortion.
Doctor: No, I mean you're physically unable to have an abortion, because you can't get pregnant.
Mrs. Garrison: But I missed my period.
Doctor: N-that's right.
Mrs. Garrison: But I paid five thousand dollars to be a woman. This would mean I I'm not really a woman. Ih, I'm just a... a I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis!
Doctor: Basically, yes.
Mrs. Garrison: ...Oh boy, do I feel like a jackass.
Mrs. Garrison: Hey asshole!
Dr. Biber: Excuse me, I'm performing an operation here!
Mrs. Garrison: You told me you were going to make me into a woman!
Dr. Biber: I gave you a sex change.
Patient: Am I a man yet?
Dr. Biber: Mr. Garrison, I can't reattach your organs.
Mrs. Garrison: Why the hell not?!
Dr. Biber: Because I've already used your testicles to fashion new knees for a little boy who wanted to be tall and black.
Mrs. Garrison: You WHAT?!
Dr. Biber: And your scrotum has been made into a dorsal fin for a man who wanted to look more like a dolphin.
Coach: Who are you?
Kyle: Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
Coach: Well, you're tall and black enough. All right, Broflovski, suit up!
Mrs. Garrison: Boys, have you seen Kyle?! He's not at home.
Dr. Biber: He's going to play basketball? Oh my God.
Mrs. Garrison: What?
Stan: What?! But you made him into a basketball player.
Singer: ...and the home of the... brave! [the lights come up and everyone cheers. The teams take the floor for the jump ball. The referee tosses the ball up and Colorado #32 taps the ball to his team]
Coach: Broflovski, be ready to take over for Owens.
Gerald: Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?
Usher: We don't... have one.
Gerald: Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.
Usher: Ahhh- Too bad?
Gerald: Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!
Usher: You're a lawphin?
Usher: Tickets please.
Mrs. Garrison: We don't have tickets!
Mrs. Garrison: Look, there's a boy with my balls in his knees and he's in serious danger!
Usher: What?
Coach: All right. Broflovski, you're going in next possession.
Mrs. Garrison: Gerald, where's Kyle?!
Gerald: What? Why??
Mrs. Garrison: My balls are in his knees. If he jumps with them they'll explode!
Security Guard: There they are, next to that dolphin!
Wyoming Coach: Hey, what the hell?!
Announcer: Broflovski goes for the dunk!
Officer: So let me get this straight. That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin.
Stan: Yeah, that's basically it.
Dr. Biber: I'm sorry, Kyle, I should have told you the surgery was cosmetic only.
Gerald: So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?
Dr. Biber: Let's get you two up to the clinic and I'll change you back, for a nominal fee.
Kyle: But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
Kyle: Going away? For how long?
Stan: Forever.
Chef: I'm sorry boys.
Chef: Wow!
Mrs. Garrison: Chef?? What kind of questions do you think adventuring around the world is gonna answer?!
Chef: What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?
Mrs. Garrison: I hope you're making the right choice.
Jimbo: Bye-bye!
Gerald: Good-bye!
Mr. Mackey: So long!
A Man: So long Chef!
A Sign-Holder: Good-bye, Chef!
Randy: Good-bye, Chef! Have a good time at the Super Adventure Club!
Kyle: Draw two card, fatass.
Chef: Hello there, children!
Stan: He's back!
Kyle: Yeah!
Kyle: Chef! I can't believe you're back!
Chef: Well, it's true.
Stan: But are you back for good?
Chef: That's right.
Mrs. Garrison: Hey everybody! Chef's back!
Gerald: Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like interesting people.
Chef: Yeah!
Mrs. Garrison: But now that you're back here, does that mean you're not in the Super Adventure Club anymore?
Chef: N-No! No.
Randy: Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?
Chef: That's right.
Jimbo: Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.
Chef: Thank you, Jimbo.
Randy: Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.
Chef: That's right! Thank you. Good-bye everybody.
Townsfolk: Later. Great to have you back. Bye-bye. See ya Chef. See you later. Bye-bye.
Kyle: Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.
Stan: Right. Uh, see ya.
Cartman: Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
Kyle: Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
Cartman: Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
Clyde: Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
Kyle: Like what?
Stan: What??
Chef: Hello there, children!
The Boys: Hey Chef.
Chef: How's it goin'?
Kyle: Good.
Chef: Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?
Chef: Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.
Kyle: ...Chef?? A-are you ok?
Chef: I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.
Stan: Dude, what are you saying??
Chef: I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.
Stan: ...WHAT??
Det. Jarvis: Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef.
Kyle: This doesn't make any sense!
Det. Jarvis: We have some information that all this time Chef has been and still is a pedophile.
Stan: No he's not.
Stan: No he's not.
Butters: What's a pedophile?
Stan: NO!
The Class: NO!
Kyle: Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!
Chef: Hello there, children!
Chef: Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love.
Stan: No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
Chef: Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass?
Kyle: Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!
Cartman: ...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
Kyle: He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.
Kyle: Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.
Stan: Well look, he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
Cartman: Yeah!
Kyle: All right, come on guys!
Butler: May I help you?
Kyle: Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
Head Adventurer: Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be quite a trek, and so we'll need to have a-
Butler: Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you.
Head Adventurer: Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads! I'm Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire! Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club!
Club Members: Tally ho!
Mr. Connolly: Indeed!
Mr. Connolly: What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does!
Marksman: We travel around the world and have sex with children!
Marine: Yes, what else would we do?
Kyle: Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!
Kyle: ...Dude!
Mr. Connolly: I know, but it gets even better! From there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you ALL like to join the Super Adventure Club!
Stan: NO!!
Kyle: Dude, what are you doing?
Kyle: Just what the hell is that thing?!
Mr. Connolly: What? What thing? I don't see anything.
Kyle: HA! I knew it!
Stan: Knew what?
Kyle: The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this - fruity little club!
Cartman: Oh, son of a bitch!
Chef: Come on, Children. Let's all go home and make love.
Stan: You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
Chef: I just like to make love up your butt.
Dr.Neeland: Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today?
Kyle: Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.
Dr. Neeland: I thought that club was for hiking and kayaking.
Stan: No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.
Dr. Neeland: Oh. ...Oh, that's right, yeah.
Chef: Doctor, do you have- children?
Dr. Neeland: Why, yes, I have two young boys.
Chef: Have you all been sodomizing your children too?
Dr. Neeland: You say he's never been like this before?
Cartman: No, Chef has always been super-cool.
Chef: I'm gonna make love to the children.
Dr. Neeland: He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen.
Cartman: So what can we do??
Dr. Neeland: I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process.
Kyle: But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!
Dr. Neeland: Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children?
Stan: Having sex with women.
Dr. Neeland: Then that's it. We'd better get your friend to the Peppermint Hippo right away.
DJ: All right guys. be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is Monique!
Stan: This isn't working.
Kyle: No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
Cartman: Come on, bitch! Dance!
Blonde: Up yours, fatty.
Cartman: Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!
Chef: God-damn!
Stan: Chef, we're leaving.
Chef: Wait a minute.
Stan: He's remembering.
Chef: Children! What have I done?
Cartman: It's ok Chef, Go on, remember!
Chef: I'm goinna- I'm gonna-
Kyle: Come on, Chef! You can do it!
Chef: I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!
The Boys: Yay!
The Boys: Chef!
Stan: Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
Cartman: Look, If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!
Mr. Connolly: We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life!
Stan: Oh Jesus, here we go.
Mr. Connolly: Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club.
Stan: We don't wanna hear it.
Stan: Immortal?
Kyle: ...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?
Mr. Connolly: Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years?
Stan: Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.
Stan: We're not leaving without Chef.
Kyle: We're not going anywhere without Chef.
Guard 1: All right, come on kids.
Kyle: No! Hey!
Kyle: Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!
Kyle: Chef, come on!
Chef: Childern!
William: Get out of here!
Cartman: Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
Cartman: Run Chef!
Stan: We made it!
Stan: Chef, come on!
Mr. Connolly: You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty!
Mr. Connolly: Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL!
Kyle: No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??
Chef: Get the hell out of here, children!
Chef: Ah!
Cartman: A grizzly bear!
Stan: Oh my God...They killed Chef!
Kyle: You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!!
Cartman: Oh never mind.
Stan: Come on, let's go.
Randy: Yeah.
Mr. Connolly: Is it working? Is it working?
Tech: Yes. We've got a pulse!
Darth Chef: Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury Steak?
Mr. Connolly: Yes, go on.
Darth Chef: And for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls?
Mr. Connolly: Oh? You mean like chocolate candy?
Darth Chef: No, I mean my balls.
Mr. Connolly: Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa!
Gerald: Hey there, Richard!
Richard: Well... Good for you.
Stephen: Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski.
Mrs. Garrison: Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he's better than everyone else.
Driver: Hey, is that a hybrid?
Gerald: Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.
Gerald: Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.
Kyle: What?!
Gerald: Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!
Kyle: But Dad, I want-
Stan: Oh hey Kyle.
Kyle: Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?
Stan: Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
Gerald: Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
Randy: A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!
Randy: You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!
Gerald: Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.
Randy: I know it's not a real ticket!!
Gerald: Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.
Kyle: Dad, let's just go!
Gerald: Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.
Randy: The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!
Randy: And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
Randy: There, like that! Stop that!
Darryl: Who the hell put this faggy fake ticket on my truck!
Gerald: Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.
Ike: Take offense.
Kyle: ...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
Gerald: Well, I totally agree, Kyle.
Kyle: You do??
Gerald: Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
Kyle: What??
Butters: Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
Stan: Going away party? What do you mean?
Butters: Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.
Butters: Well he is.
Stan: Where's the going-away party?
Butters: At Cartman's house.
Token: Hey Eric, where's Kyle?
Clyde: Kyle, the person leaving.
Cartman: Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
Clyde: Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.
Stan: What?!
Stan: Kyle! Du-what is going on?!
Kyle: My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
Stan: Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.
Gerald: I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.
Stan: Well... Maybe they'll change.
Stan: Nooo!
Sheila: Oh Gerald, it's beautiful.
Man: Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors.
Gerald: Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.
Sheila: Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.
Peter: Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis
Paul: Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue. This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and our daughter, Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan
Gerald and Sheila: Hello.
Paul: We noticed your hybrid out front - that's a V series, right?
Gerald: Yeah. That's right.
Gerald: Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?
Gerald: Yeah. We sure are.
Stan: Come on, people. Come on, people now. [Cartman and Butters enter]
Cartman: Dude, what are you doing?
Stan: I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
Cartman: THAT's gay, heh.
Stan: Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
Cartman: Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
Stan: You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
Stan: Come on, people. Come on, people now.
Laura Tucker: Hey Jimbo, you got a hybrid too?
Randy: I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"
Mr. Mackey: Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?
Stan: Come on, everybody be people now
Jimbo: Great speech!
Stan: Yeah.
Stan: Ow!
Ranger McFriendly: You son of a bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?!
Stan: What?!
Stan: Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
Ranger McFriendly: Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug!
Stan: Smug?
Ranger McFriendly: Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America!
Announcer: This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin!
Anchor Tom: It looks like we have a smug alert here in South Park. Our own Keenan Williams has the details. Keenan?
Singer: A smuggy day in San Francisco town.
Paul: Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian?
Sheila: No! Hello, how are you?
Gerald: Hey there. Alan, right?
Alan: Actually, it's Alain
Gerald: Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?
Alan: Can I just get an empty glass?
Brian: We drink and take drugs.
Boy 1: Do you want some acid?
Kyle: Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
Boy 2: You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.
Brian: It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.
Gerald: Everything okay in here, Kyle?
Kyle: Yeah, fine, Dad.
Kyle: Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
Ike: I want three.
Cartman: Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
Cartman: You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
Butters: Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
Cartman: No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!
Stan: Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.
Cartman: Who?
Ranger McFriendly: You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse!
Stan: What is that?
Keenan: It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.
Stan: George Clooney's acceptance speech?
Keenan: Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction.
Ranger McFriendly: We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm!
Stan: What about San Francisco?
Randy: Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
Randy: Yeah. Good going, stupid!
Ranger McFriendly: Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's fault, there is still something we can do. If we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town.
Randy: Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!
Randy: Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
Ranger McFriendly: How long do we have until the smug clouds collide?
Keenan: Not long. The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona.
Butters: Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
Butters: But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
Ranger McFriendly: All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up!
Stan: Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
Keenan: They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time!
Man: Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan.
Cartman: I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
Cartman: Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
Butters: Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
Randy: That's it. That's that the last one.
Ranger McFriendly: Keenan? Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!
Cartman: Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
Butters: That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
Cartman: Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
Kyle: The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.
Ike: I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls.
Network Anchor: And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I'm afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole.
Stan: No...
Randy: I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.
Clyde: Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!
Stan: What?
Clyde: It's a miracle!
Stan: Kyle!
Kyle: Hey Stan.
Gerald: We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
Richard: So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.
Randy: Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.
Mr. Mackey: But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?
Randy: You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
Kyle: Yeah!
Gerald: I don't think I can do it either.
Mr. Mackey: It's simply asking too much.
Randy: Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
Kyle: Yeah, I guess so.
Cartman: We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
Randy: STAAAN!!
Shelly: Whats going on dad?
Man: AWWWGH!
Stan: Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
Kyle: I have no idea!
Man: Take cover in the community center again!
Jimbo: All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!
Stephen: We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him!
Stan: Sso?
Crowd: AWWW!
Stan: Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??
Linda: So what happens now?
Crowd: Oh thank God.
Randy: Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.
Stan: They censored the image of Mohammad? How?
Kyle: I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
Kyle: Dude, it's a good show.
Lois: Peter, I can't believe you invited your old high-school sweetheart over for dinner.
Chris: Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?
Stewie: Perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous.
Peter: Love will keep us together
Kyle: Hehaha, heh.
Cartman: Yich.
Lois: But Peter, I don't wanna cook dinner for your ex-girlfriend.
Peter: Well, maybe we can just have tea.
Kyle: That's it? That's all they did?
Cartman: Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.
Stan: What? What's the big deal?
Kyle: Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!
Stan: Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
Cartman: That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
Kyle: Uhhh...
Sheila: Kyle? Kyle, what are you watchi-?!
Peter: Hey Brian, this is like the time I got a job as a carrot cake.
Kyle: Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!
Sheila: You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!
Kyle: Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.
Sheila: You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!
Mrs. Garrison: Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad.
Mrs. Garrison: Kyle, you're not being very sensitive.
Cartman: Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.
Stan: The hell's going on now?!
Principal Victoria: Shh! Quiet, students, quiet!
Cartman: What?
Mrs. Garrison: Why would they-?
SNN Anchor: Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat
Mr. Mackey: Retaliation... Oh my God. M'kay?
Stan: Does this mean we don't have school all week?
Cartman: You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
Kenny: (Like what?)
Cartman: We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
Stan: Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
Cartman: Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
Stan: To Los Angeles?
Kyle: Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
Cartman: Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
Kyle: All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!
Kyle: Dad? Are you sure there's time?
Gerald: This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!
Kyle: No!
Ike: Ice cream. I want chocolate.
Kyle: Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
Kyle: It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.
Cartman: You know we might not even make it into the studio.
Kyle: I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
Cartman: So what made you change your mind?
Cartman: Well Kyle, we'd better get going.
Cartman: Are you set?
Kyle: I'm set! Let's do this!
Mayor McDaniels: I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.
Jimbo: So how do we do that?
Randy: I like the sand idea.
Mr. Mackey: Yeah, me too.
Mayor McDaniels: We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!
Kyle: We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
Cartman: Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
Kyle: What are you talking about?!
Cartman: YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
Kyle: I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
Cartman: Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
Cartman: Kyle, stop it!
Kyle: Ahhh!
Stan: Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
Randy: It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?
Stan: Yeah.
Stan: Dad, this is stupid.
Prof. Thomas: Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and... not have his head in the sand.
Dylan: Yes, I know.
Wife: Dylan, please, you can't!
Cartman: Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!
Kyle: You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
President Bush: Are you the network president?
FOX President: Yes, Mr. President.
President Bush: But Mr. President, this is a matter of national security. They must be reasoned with.
SNN Anchor: The idea has swept the nation! But where will we find enough sand for everyone?
Announcer: ...and the battle between Good and Evil is finally waged...
Announcer: Previously on South Park...
Cartman: I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
Cartman: Kyle, stop it!
Cartman: So long, Kyle!
Kyle: You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!
Phillip: Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch?
Mohammad: Hey guys, how's it going?
Terrance: Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.
Mohammad: I'm here to investigate a murder.
Terrance: ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!
Phillip: You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!
Network President: Ey! You guys know the rules! Nobody can show the image of Mohammad anymore. It's dangerous.
Terrance: But you ruined the whole show!
Network President: Ey! I run this network, not you guys! And if you ask me, your show has become so preachy and full of messages that you've forgotten how to be funny! NO Mohammad!
Network President: I doubt it! I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled.
Cartman: Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.
Receptionist: What is it regarding?
Cartman: Dude, can I go before you?
Bart: Eat my shorts!
SNN Anchor: Osama bin Laden had this to say:
Kyle: Who?
Cartman: So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
Bart: Not nicely.
Cartman: Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
Bart: Cool, man.
Bart: Isn't that like, terrorism?
Cartman: ...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
Bart: I could do that.
Cartman: This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
Bart: I'm a pretty bad kid.
Cartman: Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
Bart: I stole the head off a statue once.
Cartman: Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
Cartman: Seeya.
Reporters: Yeah!
Reporter 5: That's right!
FOX President: Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup.
Staff: Oh, poor kid.
FOX President: I feel terrible. It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.
FOX President: What was that?
Kyle: Thanks a lot for the ride.
Kyle: I'll do everything I can.
Bart: Who wants to know?!
Kyle: Oh thanks, dude.
Bart: Cowabunga, motherfucker!
Mitchell: Oh hi, Miss Travis.
Lois: Peter, you didn't do the laundry today.
Waiter: Qu pasa, seores?
Gary Coleman: Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?
Cartman: Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
Mitchell: That isn't gonna work on them.
Cartman: Why not?
Mitchell: Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats.
Kyle: Cartman!
Cartman: Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
Kyle: You fat sun of a bitch!
Bart: Yeah.
Bart: Cool man!
Kyle: Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
Kyle: WHAT?!
Mitchell: We don't know, Mr. President. They just stopped working.
FOX President: Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!
Executive: Twenty-five minutes.
Cartman: How the hell did you get out?
Cartman: Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
Kyle: Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
Kyle: Ow. Quit it!
Cartman: Stop it!
Kyle: Ow. Quit it!
Kyle: No more timeouts, fatass!
Cartman: Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!
FOX President: Network Control! This is the President! I want you to pull the episode.
Computer Voice: Abort System initiated.
Programmer 1: Awaiting confirmation.
Woman: Mr. President, we need your final approval code.
FOX President: Who are you?
Woman: Mr. President, we need final authorization!
FOX President: You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network?
Cartman: Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
Woman: Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!
Kyle: Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
Cartman: No! Think about the people who could get hurt!
FOX President: Ah... I don't know who to listen to!
FOX President: But he has a gun.
Kyle: You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
Cartman: Shut up, Kyle!
FOX President: I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me.
Cartman: Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!
FOX President: I shouldn't even be in the office still. It's supposed to be half-day Friday.
Woman: Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!
Kyle: Do the right thing, Mr. President.
FOX President: How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again.
Kyle: I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
Cartman: No gay speeches, Kyle!
Woman: Mr. President, we need a decision now!
Lois: Peter! You got a pink slip at work?
Peter: Anyway, what were we talking about?
Peter: Oh yeah, my pink slip.
President Bush: Hey, that wasn't bad at all. They just showed Mohammad standin' there, lookin' normal.
An Official: Mr. President, the terrorists are retaliating!
President Bush: What?!
SNN anchor: As soon as the image of Mohammad appeared, terrorist leader al-Zawahri announced the retaliation!
American Male 2: Ugh! We love to crap!
Al-Zawahri: Oh yeah, take THAT! We burned you! THAT WAS WAY FUNNIER THAN FAMILY GUY.
Waiter: Hi, welcome to P.F Chang's. How spicy would you like me to make your Chang sauce?
Head Waiter: Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check.
Head Waiter: Well what about the new waiter?
Chris: The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high.
Male Diner: Will you just place our order, please?
Towelie: Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
Head Waiter: Everything okay here?
Male Diner: Fine, except this towel has been mixing Chang sauce for fifteen minutes. He's clueless!
Towelie: Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless!
Male Diner: Yeah? Well you're a towel!
Head Waiter: All right, that's it! Get out of here! You're fired!
Towelie: Yeah!
Head Waiter: Not him, you!
Towelie: Awww.
Waiter: Hi, welcome to P.F Chang's. How spicy would you like me to make your Chang sauce?
Head Waiter: Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check.
Head Waiter: Well what about the new waiter?
Chris: The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high.
Male Diner: Will you just place our order, please?
Towelie: Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
Head Waiter: Everything okay here?
Male Diner: Fine, except this towel has been mixing Chang sauce for fifteen minutes. He's clueless!
Towelie: Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless!
Male Diner: Yeah? Well you're a towel!
Head Waiter: All right, that's it! Get out of here! You're fired!
Towelie: Yeah!
Head Waiter: Not him, you!
Towelie: Awww.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, students, we have a very special guest speaker today. Who can tell me the name of our country's last vice-president?
Kyle: Dick Cheney?
Mr. Mackey: No, the last one.
Butters: Bill Clinton.
Stan: Who?
Kyle: Just play the game, fatass!
Kyle: Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
Stan: Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!
Cartman: Dude, what are you doing?
Stan: Oh, hey Dad.
Randy: Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?
Stan: Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
Randy: ManBearPig?
Kyle: He's half man and half bearpig
Cartman: No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
Kyle: That doesn't make any sense.
Stan: He could be half bear, half manpig.
Randy: Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.
Stan: But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.
Stan: Hello?
Al Gore: Hello, this is Al Gore.
Al Gore: I was the vice president.
Stan: I know.
Al Gore: Can you and your friends make it to an emergency ManBearPig meeting tomorrow morning? I have some evidence he could be in this area.
Stan: Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.
Stan: No, no, it's not that.
Stan: Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
Al Gore: No you don't.
Stan: Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.
Al Gore: Are you serial?
Stan: ...Yes, I'm serial.
Cartman: Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
Kenny: (Yeah, I don't get it.)
Stan: Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
Stan: NO.
Al Gore: Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him.
Stan: Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
Kyle: Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.
Al Gore: Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away.
Kyle: Yeah, we've got school anyway.
Cartman: You... have that kind of power?
Al Gore: Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial!
Group: Yeah.
Tour Guide: Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.
Al Gore: Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately?
Al Gore: All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings.
Kyle: What do ManBearPig droppings look like?
Al Gore: Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike.
Tour Guide: Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?
Al Gore: Not yet.
Kyle: What?
Group: Wow...
Stan: Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
Stan: Oh no!
Al Gore: No!
Al Gore: Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig!
The Boys: Help!
Al Gore: Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!
Kyle: Hello?
Stan: Help!
Kyle: We're trapped in here!
Cartman: Somebody get us some help down hyah!
Kyle: Hello, help!
Cartman: Hello??
Kenny: (Hello!)
Stan: Help!
Kyle: Forget it! They can't hear us!
Kenny: (What are we gonna do??)
Cartman: You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
Stan: Maybe there's another way out of here.
Kenny: (Oh, no kidding.)
Kyle: You see anything, Kenny??
Kyle: Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??
Kyle: It looks like we're completely sealed in.
Kenny: (Yeah, No shit.)
Kyle: Maybe we should go for it.
Kyle: Why?
Cartman: I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
Stan: Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
Cartman: No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
Kyle: No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
Miner 2: Does anybody know who these kids are?
Miner 1: No, nobody seems to knew them. Only that they were in the tour group. Digging to them is going to take days.
Miner 1: What do you mean? The cave-in is over.
Al Gore: I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in.
Fireman: What is that, a pigbearman?
Al Gore: No, stupid! It's ManBearPig!
Stan: I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
Cartman: I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
Kyle: Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!
Stan: Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
Kyle: C-Cartman?
Kyle: Dude, what are you doing?
Cartman: Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
Kyle: Dude, get away from me!
Miner 3: Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down. Now, w-what exactly do you suggest we do?
Al Gore: I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out! And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging!
Miner 3: Well, see, the problem is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead, it will kill those boys too.
Police Officer: Do you want me to get the ex vice president out of here?
Miner 2: Naw, I f- I feel kind of bad for him. I don't think he has any friends.
HBC Reporter: It's been three days since four unidentified children were trapped in a cave-in. Three days without food and time is certainly running out. The digging continues, but progress is fatally slow.
Miner 1: All right, people, we've gotta work faster! Our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called Smuggler's Den.
Ranger: Smuggler's Den?
Miner 1: Based on where the boys were seen last, they're somewhere near this area! Hopefully they've followed the first rule of survival and stayed put.
Kyle: Stan! Stan, wake up!
Stan: How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
Kyle: Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
Kyle: Come on come on! Pull!
Stan: Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!
Kyle: What the hell is that??
Stan: Cartman?
Kenny: (We're almost there!)
Cartman: No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
Miner 1: That's it! Pull everyone out! There's nothing more we can do!
Fireman 2: You're calling off the rescue?
Miner 1: We didn't plan on a freak river flood. God must really want those kids dead.
Cartman: Grab my hand.
Kyle: Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
Cartman: I can't kick!
Kyle: Yes you can!
Cartman: I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
Kyle: I need your help!
Stan: Kyle! No!
Al Gore: We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more.
Stan: Agh.
Stan: Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!
Kyle: We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
Stan: Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
Kyle: Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?
Cartman: It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!
Tour Guide 2: Hey, that looks like the fake treasure from our Smuggler's Den photo room.
Tour Guide 2: Yeah, we put it there for kids to take their picture with. All in all, I'd say that treasure is worth about fourteen dollars.
Kyle: You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
Mr. Mackey: Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital!
Liane: Eric, why would you do such a thing?
Cartman: I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
Mr. Mackey: You know that's not the point!
Cartman: Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
Liane: That's very naughty, Eric.
Cartman: Well he called me chubby!
Mr. Mackey: We have tried at this school to make Eric understand that there are boundaries, mkay?! But frankly, we believe his behavioral problems start at home!
Cartman: Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!
Announcer: This eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave.
Cartman: Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!
Stella: And you must be Eric.
Cartman: Mom, I want a Twinkie.
Stella: Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done.
Stella: I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.
Cartman: The hell do you think you're doing?
Cartman: Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!
Cartman: Time out?
Stella: It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up.
Stella: Eric, you have to stay in time-out!
Cartman: Ummm, no?
Cartman: All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
Cartman: I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
Liane: Yeah, it's best to avoid his level.
Stella: All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!
Cartman: [hooks up the X-Box again] Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
Cartman: Because you took my Xbox.
Stella: Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life?
Cartman: Well, yeah.
Cartman: Yeah. I guess so.
Cartman: Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
Stella: Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you.
Cartman: Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
Stella: Oh, I just never had kids.
Cartman: Why not?
Stella: It... just... didn't happen.
Liane: Eric, naughty.
Stella: Find yourself another nanny... television show!
Jo: This child's behavior is totally unacceptable!
Jo: Well, there's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time you're going to see a new Eric Cartman.
Doctor: I'm afraid Super Nanny is in a deep state of mental psychosis.
Liane: What do you mean?
Liane: Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.
Doctor: Well there... is... one more show you could still try.
Announcer: When good dogs go bad, there's one man who's their best friend. Cesar Millan.
Cesar: No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer.
Liane: Please, come in.
Cesar: So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?
Liane: Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.
Cesar: So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.
Cartman: You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
Cesar: See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him.
Cartman: Not interested in me?
Cesar: See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you.
Cartman: Yeah, well I don't see why-
Cartman: Hey!
Cesar: Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.
Cartman: Mom, this guy doesn't-
Cartman: Ah! Quit it!
Liane: What what is it that you're doing?
Cesar: Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant.
Cartman: Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
Cartman: KNOCK IT OFF!
Liane: Oh, that's very interesting.
Cesar: I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
Cartman: I'm not fat!
Liane: Well, no, I don't.
Cesar: Go on, take your son for a walk.
Cartman: Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
Cesar: See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along.
Cartman: Mom, this is degrading!
Cartman: Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!
Cesar: Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.
Cartman: Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
Cartman: Mom!
Cesar: Good, Ms. Cartman. Very good!
Announcer: And now, back to the Dog Whisperer.
Cesar: It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
Cesar: You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy.
Liane: Ahall right.
Cartman: This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
Cartman: Quit it, mom!
Liane: It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.
Cartman: Ooo, Colonel?
Cartman: Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.
Cartman: Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
Cartman: Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!
Cesar: We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.
Liane: Oh, very good, sweetie.
Cesar: Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.
Cartman: Suck my asshole, taco vendor!
Cesar: See?
Cartman: You can't do that to me, I-
Cartman: Goddamnit, you just can't-
Cesar: I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.
Liane: Wow, I have a lot to learn.
Cesar: It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle.
Cartman: Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
Kyle: You'er not staying at my house either.
Cartman: All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
Butters: No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
Kenny: (Fuck you.)
Cartman: Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
Jimmy: Who is your best friend?
Cartman: You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
Jimmy: What's my last name?
Craig: ...But I hate you.
Cartman: ...Should that really matter at a time like this?
Cartman: This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
Cartman: All right, I'm back.
Liane: Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home.
Cartman: Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
Liane: Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.
Cartman: That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
Liane: Cesar...
Cesar: How is the painting going?
Cartman: Aw, Goddammit!
Cesar: Oh look it came back.
Liane: Yup, just like you said he would.
Cartman: What is he still doing here?!
Liane: He said he's hungry. What should I do?
Cesar: Well let's feed it.
Cartman: What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
Cesar: This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
Cesar: Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?
Liane: Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!
Cartman: Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
Cartman: Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-
Cartman: Seriously! Mom-
Cartman: Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?
Cartman: Mom?!
Cartman: Mom? Mom...
Liane: Oh... Oh my gosh!
Cesar: See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state.
Liane: He's never done this before.
Cesar: Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.
Cesar: This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now.
Cesar: Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.
Liane: Sounds divine!
Cesar: So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?
Liane: Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him.
Cesar: That's greeat!
Cesar: Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend.
Cesar: Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality.
Cartman: Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.
Butters: Kill your mom?
Cartman: She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.
Stan: Dude, have you lost more weight?
Cartman: Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
Kyle: Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
Stan: Dude, we're not killing your mom.
Cartman: Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
Stan: Where am I supposed to get a gun?
Cartman: Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
Stan: I'm not shooting anybody.
Cartman: Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.
Kyle: NO, Cartman!
Cartman's Conscience: Wait. Maybe I don't have the right to kill my mom.
Cartman's Good Side: She isn't an object you can own. She's a human being.
Cartman: She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
Cartman's Bad Side: No, she's just... out to make you suffer!
Cartman's Good Side: The world doesn't revolve around me?
Cartman's Good Side: The world doesn't revolve around me!
Liane: Why Eric, you made your own breakfast.
Cartman: Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham.
Liane: And you're studying before school?
Cartman: Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.
Cartman: Tha... thank you?
Liane: I love you, sweetie.
Liane: Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.
Cesar: How is the child doing?
Liane: Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.
Cesar: That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too.
Cesar: Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles.
Liane: Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.
Cartman: No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
Cartman: Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
Cartman: Okay, I'm back.
Cartman: Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
Cartman: Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
Cartman: Heheh, totally, heheh.
Stan: H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.
Randy: Stan!
Stan: What?!
Stan: All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
Kyle: Wow, look at all these people playing right now.
Cartman: Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.
Kyle: Who is this?
Stan: This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
Cartman: Get out of here, asshole!
Stan: He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
Stan: Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
Cartman: That sonofabitch!
Kyle: Who is that guy?
Stan: Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!
Rep: O..ohhh that shouldn't happen. We designed the game so that players have to agree to a duel before they can kill each other.
Stan: Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!
Cartman: He's a God damned butthole!
Co-Worker: Oh no.
President: Fellow board members, we have a problem: somebody in the World of Warcraft is ignoring the World's rules...and is going around killing innocent players..
Member 1: Why kill innocent players? The game is about finishing quests.
Member 2: We've got to delete him from the servers.
Member 3: Jesus...
President: Jim, your kids' characters are already dead.
Randy: Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.
Randy: What?? Why?? Why?!
Cartman: My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
Kyle: The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!
Tweek: Mine too!
Cartman: We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
Token: Hey yeah!
Jimmy: We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!
Clyde: Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.
Stan: Dude, we have to try.
Clyde: I've got better things to do.
Cartman: When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?
Clyde: No.
Cartman: Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?
Clyde: All right all right, I'll do it!
Jimmy: So what's the p-plan?
All: To victory!
Butters: I don't play World of Warcraft.
Cartman: Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!
Butters: Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
Cartman: Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
Butters: O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then.
Cartman: All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.
Craig: Got it.
Cartman: The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
Jimmy: All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us.
Timmy: Timmy!
Cartman: Butters? What the hell are you doing?
Butters: I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
Cartman: You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
Butters: Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
Cartman: So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
Stan: Come on, let's do this!
Jason: Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.
Stan: Look! There he is!
Kyle: He's targeting us.
Stan: Dad??
Randy: Yeah, I'm playing from the office.
Stan: Dad, get off our teamspeak line!
Member 3: Oh Jesus...Oh God no...
President: What?
Member 3: He just finished killing every single player in the Arathi Highlands.
Member 1: How many people's characters were in there?
Member 1: There are over seven million people who log on to World of Warcraft! Are you telling me all those people's characters are going to die, and there's nothing we can do to save them?
President: Yes. And it won't be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether. Gentlemen, this could very well lead to the end of the World...of Warcraft.
Cartman: What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
Stan: Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
Cartman: Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
Kyle: We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.
Cartman: That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
Kyle: Boars?
Cartman: There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
Kyle: Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
Butters: What's a urinal?
Stan: A wall toilet for peeing in.
Mr. Mackey: And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?!
Jimmy: Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
Cartman: Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
Kyle: Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
Cartman: Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
Officer 1: I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on.
Mr. Mackey: But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.
Officer 1: But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
Officer 1: So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime.
Frank: That sure is a mystery.
Joe: Yeah, it sounds super-hard.
Frank: Whoever did it must have been angry with the school. Oh... Oooo... I think I'm getting a clue.
Joe: F-really?
Frank: Yeah, this is totally giving me a clue right now.
Frank: My clue is kind of pointing this way.
Frank: I've still got a raging clue.
Stan: Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
Kyle: Not yet.
Cartman: They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
Kyle: Will you shut up about 9/11!
Cartman: Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
Kyle: Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
Cartman: Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
Kyle: Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
Stan: Yeah, at least one-fourth.
Kyle: Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
Butters: Hey, fellas!
Cartman: Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
Butters: Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
Cartman: Aha! Do you see?
Kyle: Where did you hear that?
Cartman: I rest my case.
Butters: Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
Cartman: That's right, Butters.
Kyle: Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
Cartman: What? People see the truth?
Butters: Can I go now?
Kyle: [rolls his eyes] Oh no...
Mrs. Garrison: Okay, thank you, Leroy, thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class. Okay, anybody else have anything for Show and Tell?
Mrs. Garrison: All right, Eric, you can go next.
Clyde: Whoa...
Kyle: Me??!
Sheila: Hello bubbe, how was school today?
Sheila: Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.
Kyle: But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.
Sheila: Whatwhatwhaaat?!
Sheila: We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!
Principal Victoria: Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened.
Skeeter: Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth.
Other men: Oh no, oh brother, oh God.
Mr. Adler: [stands up] That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?
Other men: Oh no, oh God, that's so retarded.
Sheila: Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!
Mr. Mackey: More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you!
Jimbo: He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!
Mr. Mackey: No, I'm not saying they're related!
Skeeter: It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all!
Richard: Who else could it have been?
Det. Yates: This is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
Mr. Mackey: Oh no, not the Goddamned-
Frank: And nobody knows who's responsible?
Det. Yates: There are theories, but, nobody's certain.
Joe: Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing?
Frank: Ooo... oh, I just started getting a clue.
Joe: Really?
Frank: Yeah, I'm totally getting a clue.
Joe: Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now.
Frank: Mine's pointing to the left.
Joe: Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it.
Frank: Okay, let's follow your raging clue.
Joe: Oofff.
Kyle: I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.
Stan: Well why did you have to involve me??
Kyle: It's not my fault.
Stan: All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
Kyle: Really?
Kyle: ......Dude.
Mr. Mackey: Huh?
Mrs. Garrison: We caught the person that did it.
Stan: Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.
Kyle: They are?
911truth Man: Yeah, it a way of keeping people from seeing the real evidence. I know it seems crazy, but 9/11 was pulled off by our own government, so they could gain support for attacking the Middle East.
Kyle: What? No no no.
911truth Man: I know it's hard to believe.
Stan: Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
911truth Man: It's called the False Flag policy. Make it look like the enemy attacked you. Get all your citizens riled up and waving American flags. Then you're free to invade any country you want.
Kyle: ...That's retarded.
Kyle: There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
911truth Man: We think they came from a government office.
Kyle: What is it?
911truth Man: It's anthrax.
Kyle: Anthrax?!
911truth Man: Someday we'll use it as evidence against them.
Mr. Mackey: Why, Clyde? Why did you do it?
Principal Victoria: Mr. Mackey, Clyde's parents are here.
Mr. Donovan: Mr. Mackey, there's something you should know...
Kyle: Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.
Kyle: Uh, Mr. President, my name is-
911truth Man: You won't get away with it! People know!
911truth Man: Wait. What are you doing?
Stan: JESUS CHRIST!!
Stan: He was right. You DID cause 9/11.
Bush: Yes. Quite simple to pull off, really. All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers. Then on 9/11 we pretended like four planes were being hijacked.when really we just rerouted them to Pennsylvania, then flew two military jets into the World Trade Center filled with more explosives, then shot down all the witnesses of Flight 93 with an F-15 after blowing up the Pentagon with a Cruise missile. It was only the world's most intricate and flawlessly-executed ever, ever.
Stan: Why?!
Cheney: Dangit! I missed again!
Bush: KILL THEM!
Kyle: It just... doesn't seem right.
Stan: Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.
Man 1: Hey!
Man 2: Ogh!
Kyle: Dude! What the hell is going on?!
911truth Man: Don't kill me! I, I just do what they say!
Stan: What who said?
911truth Man: I have a family. Please don't kill me!
Stan: Oh God!
Kyle: Who the fuck are you?!
Kyle: Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
Stan: Who are you?
Kyle: You f-figured this thing all out?
Frank: Gave us both a clue.
Mr. Hardly: That clue led them to a 9/11 conspiracy group party, where they got a lot more clues.
Joe: I was getting a clue like every two minutes.
Frank: I got such a raging clue that I almost shot clue goo all over Joe.
Mr. Hardly: Those clues pointed out that all the 9/11 conspiracy theories could be disproven scientifically. And that's when Frank got his biggest clue.
Frank: It was huuuge.
Mr. Hardly: That all the 9/11 conspiracy Web sites are run by the government. The 9/11 conspiracy... is a government conspiracy.
Stan: Aw Jesus...
Kyle: Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
Mr. Hardly: For a government to have power, they must appear to have complete control. What better way to make people fear them than to convince them they are capable of the most elaborate plan on earth?
Kyle: I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
Kyle: Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
Bush: We do that too. And most people believe the truth. But one fourth of the population is retarded. If they wanna believe we control everything with intricate plans, why not let them?
Stan: How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
Kyle: Stan! What the fuck?!
Stan: It was all planned out!
Kyle: You knew this whole time? Why?
Stan: Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
Stan: The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
Kyle: So you blamed the government?!
Mr. Hardly: And the government was more than willing to take the blame, so long as it made them look responsible for 9/11!
Kyle: So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?
Stan: Yuh.
Kyle: So then, who was responsible for 9/11?
Stan: Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.
Mr. Hardly: Well, it looks like this mystery is solved. It's time for the culprit to finally pay!
Cartman: And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, "Do you smell lemon grass?", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
Cartman: What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!
Hall Monitor: I've been instructed to bring you to the principal's office.
Cartman: Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!
Hall Monitor: I'm just doin' my job.
Principal Victoria: Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.
Cartman: Aw Goddamnit!
Cartman: The hall monit- me?
Principal Victoria: If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.
Mr. Mackey: Now Eric, being the school hallway monitor is a big responsibility. M'kay? It is important that you take the job seriously, and that you don't abuse the power.
Cartman: Ahem. Me?
Boy: What?
Boy: What? You can't just push me up against the-
Teacher: And so this shape with four sides is what, class?
Teacher: What are you doing?!
Teacher: I don't think that's really necessary.
Fillmore: Ike has a crush on teacher!
Ike: I don't like Mason.
Cartman: Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?
Butters: Huh?
Cartman: Here, you need a smoke, brah?
Cartman: You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
Kyle: Huh?
Sheila: Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today.
Kyle: What's he doing at his teacher's house?
Sheila: He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.
Teacher: Your brother and I... are in love.
Kyle: He's a little young, don't you think?!
Teacher: Ike is very mature for his age, and you know it!
Ike: Ring around the rosey.
Teacher: He makes me feel like nobody else does. He loves me and only me, and I know I'm a goddess to him. When we make love, he can give it to me HARD, or soft and gentle-
Kyle: Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.
Kyle: Ike?
Teacher: Is it so hard to believe that true love exists?
Sheila: Miss Stevenson? Yes. She's very nice.
Kyle: Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.
Sheila: That's great.
Kyle: Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.
Ike: Spider-Man! I'm safe, Mom.
Sheila: Yes, Ike, you like Spider-Man, don't you?
Kyle: Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-
Ike: Weohhh part ten. Mom-my I love you I love you.
Sheila: Mommy loves you too, sweetie.
Det. Yates: You're so full of crap, Foley.
Foley: What? I did shoot him in the face. Twice.
Yates: Oh? What's the crime?
Kyle: Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.
Kyle: Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.
Officer 1: A woman.
Officer 2: Oh, but, but she's ugly, right?
Kyle: Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.
Yates: The blonde?
Kyle: Yeah.
Officer 1: Some young boy is having sex with Miss Stevenson?
Officer 1: Nisssse.
Yates: Nnice.
Kyle: What?! No, you don't understand-
Officer 1: You sure they've had sex?
Kyle: Yeah.
Officer 3: Has she performed oral sex on him?
Kyle: I think so.
Officer 3: ...Nice.
Officer 1: Nisssse.
Yates: So wait, what, what's the crime?
Kyle: Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
Kyle: Guys, can I talk to you?
Stan: Sure dude.
Cartman: Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
Kyle: Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!
Stan: Dude, what's the matter?
Kyle: The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
Stan: ...Wow.
Kenny: (Reaaly??)
Cartman: Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.
Cartman: What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
Cartman: Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
Stan: Dude, I really don't see a problem.
Cartman: Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
Cartman: They what??
Kyle: They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
Kyle: Well they're doing it!
Cartman: Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!
Ike: I like dada better.
Cartman: You got a hall pass, brah?!
Miss Stevenson: I don't need a hall pass. I'm a teacher.
Miss Stevenson: Look, just let us get back in-
Cartman: Get down on the floor!
Miss Stevenson: We're going back inside!
Miss Stevenson: Bear mace??
Miss Stevenson: Oooooh!
Cartman: ...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
Principal Victoria: "Ike, I long to feel your arms around me"?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?
Cartman: Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.
Principal Victoria: This is unbelievable.
Cartman: I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
Cartman: You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!
Jimbo: The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student
Randy: With a student? But... she's a woman.
Jimbo: Yeah. I know.
Randy: But... she's hot.
Kyle: Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
Ike: You are dead to me!
Kyle: What?
Ike: I said, you're dead to me!
Kyle: I'm dead to you?
Reporter: Tom, an elementary school teacher is under arrest for allegedly having an affair... with one of her young students. The case is shocking, due mostly to the fact that the teacher... is pretty hot, Tom. If the accusations are true, then... damn! Uh, looks like the defendant and her lawyer are about to give a statement, Tom.
Miss Stevenson: I am deeply sorry to announce that the allegations against me are true. Over the past several weeks, I have been having physical relations with one of my students.
Man 1: Nice.
Miss Stevenson: I know my actions were wrong, but I cannot be fully to blame. You see, I am an alcoholic.
Officer 4: Ohhhh.
Miss Stevenson: Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
Cartman: Oh no!
Kyle: What?
Cartman: I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
Miss Stevenson: I am a perfectly good person, but when I drink, the alcohol makes me say and do things I wouldn't normally do.
Yates: Well, that explains it.
Officer 1: Do we still press charges?
Yates: Who are we gonna convict? Johnny Walker?
Man 3: Poor woman. She's a victim.
Therapist: Alcohol is a crutch which we use to medicate ourselves; to, to cover up emotional baggage from our past. Was there ever a history of sexual abuse in your family?
Miss Stevenson: No, but my uncle used to ask me and my twin sister to kiss and he'd take pictures.
Ike: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay, Mulan!
Miss Stevenson: Get your things together. We don't have much time.
Yates: Are you sure you're not lying, Foley?
Foley: No, really! I shot both of them! They weren't even doin' nothin'!
Yates: You're kidding!
Sheila: No, it's true!
Sheila: This is serious!
Sheila: Are you going to do nothing?!
Cartman: There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
Kyle: Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.
Cartman: No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
Kyle: How do you know that?
Cartman: I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
Kyle: Who's Beth?
Cartman: Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!
Kyle: Can we get going now, please?!
Miss Stevenson: Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?
Ike: I love TV. Yaaay!
Cartman: Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
Bellboy: Hey! You can't leave your car there!
Receptionist: Can I help you?
Receptionist: Who are you?
Cartman: I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Head Concierge: I think you should leave before I call the police!
Cartman: I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
Ike: Oh no!
Miss Stevenson: Hurry darling! We have to get out of here!
Officers: What have we got? What have we got?!
Officer 5: Who called 911?!
Cartman: Freeze, bitch!
Officer 7: Freeze!
Officer 8: Hands up! Hands up!
Officer 9: Don't move! Don't move!
Miss Stevenson: Why couldn't you just leave us alone? All we wanted was to love.
Cartman: Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!
Leeroy: She gawt a scarf awn her heyed, huh?
Ike: I don deser futty bad man.
Miss Stevenson: You who don't believe in true love don't understand.
Ike: Yaaaay!
Kyle: Ike!
Officer 8: Hey kid, you need to get off the roof now.
Satan: On Halloween we shall open the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth, and we will rent out the entire W Hotel, for an awesome party, and invite a bunch of celebrities!
Satan: Have you seen those rich, spoiled, teenage girls who have massive Sweet 16 parties? That big.
Demon 2: Satan, we can't possibly do-
George Burns: Oh boy, a Halloween party up on Earth.
Ghandi: I can't believe he got the entire W Hotel.
Stan: Go ahead, Kyle, do it.
Tweek: No! Don't do it!
Cartman: What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
Cartman: I've done it lots of times.
Kyle: You're afraid to do it, too.
Cartman: I am not!
Demon 1: Satan, I must speak with thee.
Demon 1: You've invited so many celebrities on Earth to your party that people in Hell can't get wristbands.
Satan: Well I have to invite celebrities or else my party won't be cool.
Demon 1: Satan, I warn thee, do not throw this party at the cost of alienating your friends.
Bishop 1: None?
Bishop 2: Satan mocks us.
Bishop 3: His party must be stopped.
Resident Bishop: Tomorrow night, after all of Satan's guests have arrived, we'll call in a complaint about how many people are there. We'll see how long Satan's party lasts... after the fire marshal shows up.
Biggie Smalls: What the fuck is THIS?!
Stephen: Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!
Butters: I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper!
Stephen: You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now!
Butters: But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!
Stephen: Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!
Satan: So I want the DJ to set up over here, and then the main dance floor area can be this whole area right here.
Male Staffer: What about valets? Ha, how will people be arriving from Hell?
Satan: Oh, it's like a dimensional vortex gate thingy, they won't have cars.
Female Staffer: Buut we're probably gonna want security at the dimensional vortex gate.
Satan: I want all the servers dressed in skimpy outfits serving all the hors d'oeuvres.
Demon 1: This is getting really expensive.
Satan: Shut up, it's Halloween! This is my night! Then at midnight, for dessert, I'm thinking over here, we bring out a huuuge chocolate fondue fountain.
Satan: Oh, screw that, then. I don't want a fondue fountain if P Diddy had one.
Satan: Yes it matters! I don't wanna do it if Diddy did it!
Demon 1: How about a doughnut machine?
Satan: Did Diddy do it?
Male Staffer: Diddy did do it.
Satan: A full ice cream bar!
Male Staffer: Diddy did it.
Demon 1: A Ferrari cake?
Male Staffer: Diddy didn't do it.
Demon 1: Satan, really, the logistics of getting a cake the size of a Ferrari made in time-
Bundy: No problem.
Dahmer: We can handle it.
Demon 3: Heed my words: Satan's entire Halloween depends on this Ferrari cake. Fail, and you will know his greatest wrath!
Smalls: You punkass fool!
Butters: Haaaah.
Smalls: Why'd you summon me?
Butters: P-please don't ice me, homie?
Smalls: You'd better have a good reason, sucka!
Butters: I just... w-was seein' if it works.
Butters: W-what party?
Butters: Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?
Smalls: How, punk?! We don't use money in here, nigga!
Butters: Oh hamburgers!
Demon 1: Yes. Yes, Satan. Your Halloween costume turned out perfect.
Satan: Zazul, switch costumes with me.
Demon 1: Satan, Zazul worked really hard on his costume.
Demon 1: Relax, it's being picked up from the bakery.
Head Baker: Can I help you?
Bundy: We're here to pick up the Ferrari cake.
Head Baker: Ohhh yes, it's just about finished. What kind of truck are we loading it up to?
Bundy: Gacy, you numbskull, what'd ya kill him for?!
Gacy: Oh!
Dahmer: Ow.
Bundy: That was the baker!
Dahmer: He startled me.
Cartman: Dude...
Jimmy: Du... du... dude.
Stan: If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
Cartman: You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
Cartman: How do you know??
Kyle: He's right. It's just a spooky story.
Tweek: Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?
Kyle: I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
Cartman: How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
Smalls: Yo dawg, keep it down.
Butters: Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?
Stan: It does work!!
Kyle: Holy crap!!
Resident Bishop: What?
Cardinal Mahoney: The Fire Marshal is at the party! Satan invited him!
Priest: Satan's trickery knows no bounds!
Cardinal Mahoney: That's it! One way or another, we're crashing this party!
Frank Sinatra: Hey, Satan, you got a little problem.
Satan: What?
Frank Sinatra: Somebody showed up in a Crocodile Hunter costume. It's really offending some of the other guests.
Steve Irwin: Wait! I thought we were friends!
Male Staffer: The Ferrari cake! It isn't here!
Male Staffer: It was never delivered to the hotel.
Gacy: I did it for Dahmer.
Bundy: For Dahmer?
Bundy: Dahmer! Stop havin' sex with them intestines!
Dahmer: What good are intestines if you can't have sex with them?
Bundy: Oh no!
Gacy: Mmm, Ferrari.
Dahmer: We're gonna get it now.
A guest: This is a really extravagant party, Satan.
Black Bouncer: Uh, these aren't the right wristbands.
A Bishop: Uh, yes they are.
Cardinal Mahoney: In the name of Christ, just let us in!
Stan: We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.
Ticket agent: Here you go, flight 72 to Los Angeles boarding in 10 minutes.
Smalls: Motherfucking God-damnit!
Randy: That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon!
Bundy: All right, listen you mugs! It's now 11:30. That means we only have twenty minutes to bake a new Ferrari cake.
Dahmer: No problem! It just so happens that I went to an Italian cooking school.
Bundy: Yeah? Why'd you quit?
Dahmer: Ten thousand eggs.
Bundy: Gacy, go get ten thousand eggs.
Gacy: You get 'em!
Gacy: GAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Bundy: How's that?
Bundy: AAA!
Bundy: Try that again!
Gacy: What happened??
Cowboy: He can't do it, he can't do it.
Male Staffer: What do we do?? It's midnight. The Ferrari cake never arrived!
Zazul: This is terrible!
A Guest: I wonder what this is going to be.
Demonius: We did the best we could; there was a problem.
Zazul: Acuras are really nice.
Demonius: It doesn't matter. Your guests are having fun. They don't care.
Frank Sinatra: Wow, what a jerk.
A Cowboy: Come on, Helen. Let's just go back to hell. I'm suddenly not so hungry for Acura cake.
Satan: Oh God, what's happened to me? I've never been this terrible before. By trying to have a party like those spoiled rich teenage girls on MTV, I've become like one of them.
Smalls: What the-?
Smalls: I am soo sick of this! Wait, I'm at the party.
Butters: Sure, homie. I got your back, yo.
Liane: There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?
Cartman: I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
Liane: When does it come out?
Cartman: Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!
Cartman: Noo!! Nooo!!
Principal Victoria: Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it.
Mrs. Garrison: Evolution is a theory! A hare-brained theory that says I'm a monkey! I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman!
Mr. Mackey: M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven.
Mrs. Garrison: I warn you, Principal Victoria! Those students are not prepared to hear this stuff!
Principal Victoria: Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.
Cartman: How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
Stan: It's still three weeks.
Mrs. Garrison: All right kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution.
Butters: Oh boy!
Liane: Eric, you're coming home right now!
Cartman: Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
Liane: It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.
Cartman: Oh God!
Cartman: Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
Cartman: You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.
Stan: Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.
Cartman: I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
Kyle: Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
Kenny: (What?)
Stan: Do what?
Cartman: Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
Kyle: No.
Cartman: It's simple science, Kyle.
Kyle: You'll die, retard!
Cartman: I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
Stan: Dude, no way.
Kyle: Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.
Father: Principal Victoria, we are a devout Catholic family! Do you mind telling me why my daughter now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?!
Mrs. Garrsion: I told you this would happen, didn't I?!
Principal Victoria: Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that-
Mrs. Garrsion: I hear ya.
Principal Victoria: Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class.
Mr. Triscotti: You most certainly will!
Daughter: But Dad, I want to learn everything.
Mrs. Garrsion: Well, I told you. We should leave evolution out of the classrooms.
Mrs. Garrsion: Re-replaced??
Principal Victoria: Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist.
Mrs. Garrsion: Shut up, faggot! Principal Victoria, I can teach my own class!
Principal Victoria: You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!
Mrs. Garrison: Whatever.
Mr. Dawkins: You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright.
Mrs. Garrison: Do you see monkeys at the zoo?! They crap in their hands and throw it at people!
Mr. Dawkins: Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!
Mrs. Garrison: What about the fact that if I believe in this crap, you're gonna go to hell?! Doesn't that bother you a little?
Mr. Dawkins: Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist.
Mr. Dawkins: I never covered it up.
Mr. Dawkins: AAAH!
Mrs. Garrison: Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements.
Principal Victoria: Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom.
Mrs. Garrison: What??
Mr. Dawkins: Principal Victoria, I really don't think that's necessary. This woman is very opinionated but, she does care about her students.
Principal Victoria: Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??
Mr. Dawkins: Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?
Mrs. Garrison: What?!
Mr. Dawkins: Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion.
Mr. Dawkins: I've never met a woman with so much... fire
Mr. Dawkins: Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?
Cartman: Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!
Cartman: Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.
Butters: Go where?
Cartman: You're gonna help me freeze myself.
Butters: Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
Butters: Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
Cartman: No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
Cartman: All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
Mr. Dawkins: Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys.
Mrs. Garrison: Hehyeah, almost.
Mr. Dawkins: You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist.
Mrs. Garrison: Well... Well, you know, I'm... I'm open to stuff.
Mr. Dawkins: Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing?
Mr. Dawkins: Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?
Mrs. Garrison: No, I totally get it now! Evolution explains everything! There is no great mystery to life, just evolution and God's a spaghetti monster! Thank you, Richard!
Mr. Dawkins: You're so welcome!
Mrs. Garrison: Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!
Mr. Dawkins: Oh Ms. Garrison!
Mrs. Garrison: Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard! Yeah, I'm a monkey all right!
Cartman: Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.
Alien 1: Can you... understand me?
Cartman: Where am I?
Shvek: My name is Shvek. You are safe.
Cartman: Safe where, butthole?!
Shvek: My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546.
Medic: Please be careful. You are frail.
Cartman: Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
Cartman: Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!
Cartman: I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
Shvek: We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.
Mr. Dawkins: You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here.
Mrs. Garrison: [thinking] That's my man.
Mr. Dawkins: So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen.
Mrs. Garrison: That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God.
Mr. Dawkins: Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we-
Stan: Well there could still be a god.
Mrs. Garrison: What?!
Stan: Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
Mr. Dawkins: Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right.
Mrs. Garrison: What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion.
Mr. Dawkins: Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God.
Mrs. Garrison: You're the smartest man on earth, Dick. With me by your side, there's no stopping you.
Mr. Dawkins: Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again.
Butters: Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!
Butters: Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
Linda: It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?
Butters: Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?
Dougie: Okay.
Butters: Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?
Butters: Well, like what?
Dougie: ...Like, you die.
Butters: ...Die??
Dougie: Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.
Butters: Eric! Erihic!
Dougie: You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!
Butters: He told me to!
Dougie: He's dead for sure.
Dougie: Oh my God...
Butters: What??
Butters: But I just did what he told me!
Dougie: Come on, we have to leave!!
Shvek: Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii.
Medic: It's rumored that there's one at the Museum of Technology at New New Hampshire.
Cartman: So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
Shvek: Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first.
Shvek: You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason.
Medic: Lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them. But you... are special.
Cartman: I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
Shvek: You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist.
Medic: We believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group: The Unified Atheist League.
Medic: Oh no! It's the United Atheist Alliance!
Cartman: Who are they??
Cartman: Jesus Christ!
Cartman: I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
UAA Member 1: Put me through to the Allied Atheist Allegiance!
UAA Member 1: Look, Allied Atheist Allegiance! We have the time child!
AAA Leader: Science damn you, United Atheist Alliance!
UAA Member 1: Now you see, foolish sea otters, that we are the atheists in control!
AAA Leader: It won't make a difference! This is the dawning of the sea otter! Know this, time child! I shall smash your skull like a clam on my tummy!
Cartman: What??
AAA Leader: Otters! The time has come! Sound the nafferty!
Narrator: The year is 2006, and young Eric Cartman cannot wait for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Unable to cope with the wait any longer, Eric decides to freeze himself for three weeks. But a freak avalanche makes Eric impossible to find, and so he remains frozen for 500 years.
Cartman: Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.
Otter 1: Don't let the time child out of your sight. He could try to run.
Otter Leader: Something is spooking the ostriches.
Cartman: Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
Otter Leader: Here it is! We have arrived.
Blavius: All right, Time Child, we've filled our side of the bargain. Now return with us to Otter Bay.
Blavius: NOOOO!
Otter Leader: It was a trick!
Blavius: SCIENCE DAMN YOU, TIME CHILD!
Cartman: I got it! I got the Wii!
UAA Leader: Time Child! You've returned!
UAA 1: We thought for sure you had died in the in the Phobart plant.
UAA Leader: TC, wait!
UAA 1: Science be praised. This could end the war!
Cartman: Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!
Maintenance Guy: Uhh, what kind of output does this have? This is some ancient Super-VHS output or somethin'. I can't connect it to your float screen.
Cartman: There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
Maintenance Guy: It may be the future for you, but I can't hook up anything to a float screen without at least a laser-7 output.
Cartman: I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!
K-10: Bark bark. Hello, Eric. I have missed you.
Cartman: Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.
UAA Leader: Fellow atheists: the time child has returned with information on our sworn enemies, the Allied Atheist Alliance. They have started digging for clams in sector J7. If we mount an all-out attack, we can wipe out their food supply!
UAA 2: But, those are civilian otters.
UAA Leader: We cannot tolerate the otters! Their Science is flawed! Their answer to the Great Question is different from ours.
UAA 3: Yes, but... sending out all our ships at the same time... it would leave our city exposed!
UAA Leader: ...That's why we have to be super-duper sure that nobody finds out we're doing it.
UAL 2: Praise Science. This is your chance, young Shvek, to avenge your father's death.
UAL 3: Careful, son. Just because their Science leads them to a different answer to the Great Question doesn't mean we have the right to kill them all.
Announcer: With new Glade monvert cleaner, you can make your monvert sparkle like never before.
Boy 1: Agh! I'm so bored.
Boy 2: There's nothing to do.
Cartman: Tell me about it.
Boy 3: Hey, I know! Let's crank call people in the past!
Boy 1: Huh?
Singers: Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.
Announcer: New, from Blasbro, it's Crank Prank Time Phone!
Boy Announcer: I just dial a random number on the keypad, enter a date and year on the debilibrator, and...
Singers: Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.
Cartman: Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
K-10: Why does it matter? Bark bark
K-10: Bark bark. That call is for crank calling only. Using it in the way you describe is illegal.
Cartman: I care! Where's the closest toy store??
K-10: Working, bark bark. The Jarvanian shopping complex. But it is not open yet.
Cartman: Come on! Come on!
Cartman: Ugh, finally!
Clerk: Welcome to Zeebod's Toys
Cartman: I want one of those time-phone things.
Clerk: Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?
Cartman: Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.
Cartman: Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
Clerk: This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.
Cartman: Look, I have to have one of those phones!
K-10: Bark bark, I'm sorry, Eric, bark bark.
Cartman: How about a robot? How much for the robot?
K-10: Awww.
K-10: Working, bark bark. Access.
Cartman: I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
K-10: Working, bark bark.
Blavius: The United Atheist Alliance has taken the bait! Soon they will send their ships out to destroy our decoy clam fields! And while their ships are away, the United Atheist League intends to attack them! Our plan has worked perfectly! For when the United Atheist League attacks the United Atheist Alliance, we will charge in and kill them all! Our Science, our answer to the Great Question shall prevail!
Otters: Hail Science! Hail Science! Hail Science!
Blavius: And I will personally kill the Time Child, and eat his entrails on my tummy!
Boy 4: Uh yes, hello? I'm calling for Mr. Wall?
Man: I'm sorry, there's no Mr. Wall here.
Boy 4: Oh. Is Mrs. Wall there?
Man: Nno, there are no Walls here.
Man: Oh, I see! Is this the Johnson boys from down the street?!
Man: Very funny!
Boy 5: Hi, uh, I'm a Pepper, and I'm wondering if you'd like to be a Pepper too?
Boy 4: Yeah.
Cartman: Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.
Boy 4: Oh. Okay, I guess.
Boy 5: Hey!
Boy 4: Science H. Logic! What a jerk!
Otter 1: It's the Wise One
Otter 2: The Wise One speaks.
The Wise One: This is not the path we should be taking. Will more bloodshed end anything?
The Wise One: Science, reason, is that really all there is?
Blavius: They are not a logical race, Wise One! They go around chopping down trees for tables, when they have perfectly good tummies to eat on. How logical is that?!
The Wise One: Well perhaps the great Dawkins wasn't so wise. Oh, he was intelligent, but, some of the most intelligent otters I've ever known were completely lacking in common sense. Maybe, some otters do need to believe in something. Who knows? Maybe, just believing in God makes God exist.
Otter Soldier: Kill the Wise One!
Cartman: Who is this?
Cartman: What?? Who the hell is this?!
Time Child: It's me.
Cartman: Me who?!
Time Child: Me you!
Cartman: What?!
Time Child: I'm you in the future! You have to be patient and wait for the Nintendo Wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters!
Cartman: Oh very funny, Kyle!
Time Child: It's not Kyle, it's you!
Cartman: Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.
Time Child: I'm trying to do you a favor, dumb-ass!! Just listen to me!
Time Child: Butters? Butters!
Butters: Eric? Is that you?
Time Child: Butters, Butters! Listen to me! Just just listen. I'm about to come over to your house and ask you to help me freeze myself. Do not... do t!
Time Child: No! This is not a joke! Whatever I say to you, Butters, no matter how hard I try, do not... do... what I tell you!
Cartman: Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!
Butters: Huh??
Cartman: Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!
Butters: But, you're telling me not to go with you.
Time Child: Aw dammit, just listen to me! If you freeze yourself, you're going to die!
Cartman: Suck my balls!
Time Child: No, you suck my balls!! Just listen to me for one minute!
Cartman: ...Okay, you have one minute.
Time Child: Right before you left for Butters' house, you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde Frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right?
Butters: Oh, all right then.
UAL Aide: Sir! The United Atheist Alliance has sent out all their ships. Their capital is now unprotected.
Time Child: Hello? Kyle?
Kyle: Hello?
Time Child: Yes. Hello, Kyle. It's Eric. Uh, how's it going?
Kyle: What do you want?!
Time Child: Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know, so I think maybe you're the only person who can understand this. You know how earlier today I asked you to help me freeze myself?
Kyle: I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!
K-10: Bark bark. Hello, Kyle. Bark bark.
Kyle: ... I'm hanging up now.
Time Child: No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right about now, I'm in my mom's freezer.
Kyle: Suck my balls, fatass.
Time Child: Well I don't notice anything different, KIT-9! Do you?
KIT-9: I guess not, meow meow.
Time Child: Heeeeey!
KIT-9: Meow meow.
UAA Woman: TC! We're under attack!
Time Child: By who?!
UAA Woman: We have to get to the War Room! It's the only safe place!
UAA Leader: The United Atheist League is bombing the city! We're defenseless!
Cartman: This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
Tactical Officer: Sir! The sea otters are advancing! They've broken through the east portal!
UAA Leader: You fools! This will be the end of us all!
Blavius: Then accept our answer to the Great Question, and we will withdraw.
UAA Leader: Your answer to the Great Question is illogical!
Cartman: What is the Great Question?
KIT-9: What atheists should call themselves.
Shvek: Unified Atheist League is the most logical name.
UAA Leader: >Unified Atheist Alliance makes more sense.
Blavius: No! Allied Atheist Alliance! That way it has three A's! That is the logical choice!
Shvek: So be it. We cannot agree; prepare to die.
Tactical Officer: Forward missiles launched, sir!
Cartman: I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
KIT-9: But Eric, meow meow, you knew the wife of the smartest man in history.
Cartman: Who?
KIT-9: Your teacher, the one called Garrison.
Cartman: Garrison? But he's an asshole.
Mrs. Garrison: Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!
Mr. Dawkins: Oh Ms. Garrison!
Mrs. Garrison: Dammit, who the hell is calling?!
Cartman: It's an emergency! It's an emergency!
Cartman: I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
Cartman: Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!
Mr. Dawkins: Sex-change operation??
Mrs. Garrison: Uh oh.
Cartman: Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?
Shvek: Atheism? No. We've learned to get rid of all the isms in our time.
Medic: Yes. Long ago we realized isms are great for those who are rational, but in the hands of irrational people, isms always lead to violence.
Cartman: So there is no war now in the future.
Blavius: Of course there's war. The stupid French-Chinese think they have a right to Hawaii.
All: Yeah!
Shvek: We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled.
Shvek: We explained that to you already.
COCKA-3: Goodbye, Eric. I will mess you. Squawk squawk
Cartman: I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.
Liane: There you are, Eric.
Cartman: Mom! Mom, they did it!
Liane: Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.
Liane: Who are you talking to, muffin?
Clerk: Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you.
Cartman: Hello?
Time Child: Hello? Hello? I know what you're thinking! Do not do it! You just need to be patient and wait the two months! Do you hear me?!
Stan: I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.
Stan: Yeah. Why?
Mr. Jarvis: 'Cause it's being towed.
Stan: Hey, hey! What are you doing?!
Driver: This your bike?
Stan: Yes!
Stan: No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!
Judge: Yes? Come in.
Stan: Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-
Judge: Yes! Come on, Mr. Marsh. I've been told all about your case. Impounded bicycle, $83 owed to the county. Maybe you should get a job.
Stan: What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
Judge: Whoa whoa, hold on. I've looked your case over and I think maybe we can cut a little deal here. According to your background check, when you were in kindergarten, you played on the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.
Stan: ...Yeah?
Judge: Well it just so happens that the pee wee hockey team this year needs a coach.
# 10: Who are you?
Stan: My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
# 8: Coach, I have to go potty.
Stan: All right, fine, go ahead.
# 8: ...By myself?
Stan: S- hold it a while, okay?
# 7: What does "passing" mean?
Stan: When you shoot the puck to another player.
# 3: Coach, Morgan spit on my foot!
Morgan: I did not!
Stan: All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
Stan: Why not?!
# 13: My doctor says I'm not supposed to.
Stan: What, you got asthma or something?
# 3: No, he has cancer.
# 8: Nelson has leukemia. It's already spread to his bone marrow.
Stan: Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.
# 13: But why me, coach? Why?
# 7: Coach, why do people get cancer?
# 10: Are we gonna get cancer if we play with Nelson, Coach?
Gavin: Look, why don't you just give up? You can't beat us. You really want to embarrass your players?
# 7: Our coach isn't gonna let us lose!
Park County: Yeah!!
# 6: Coach, please don't let us lose to Adams County. My daddy will beat me again.
Sharon: Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!
Randy: Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!
Stan: I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
Randy: Oh, well that's good.
Sharon: What kind of job?
Stan: I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
Stan: I'm not playing, I'm coaching.
Randy: Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
Randy: Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
Randy: Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!
Randy: What are we goin' to do, Sharon??
Sharon: What?
Sharon: Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.
Randy: Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.
Crowd: Ohhhh!
Announcer: Time is running out. Stan Marsh with a chance to win!
Kyle: You got it, Stan!
Sharon: Randy, what's wrong??
Randy: OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.
Woman: We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?
Stan: Oh
Stan: Ohhh.
Mrs. Brown: Stop it, Jack! He doesn't mean to take it out on you, coach.
Stan: ... I don't know.
Mr. Brown: Will you talk to him, coach? He looks up to you.
Stan: No, I think you oughta.
Mr. Brown: Nah, I'm just his father. But you're his coach! You're like a father to him.
Stan: Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?
Stan: Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?
Nelson: How come I have to die now?
Stan: Ogh.
Nelson: I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?
Stan: Goddammit, dude, I don't know.
Nelson: I'm sorry.
Nelson: I think so.
Stan: No- dude, I told you I can't do that.
Nelson: Well then, will you just... win for me?
Gavin: Come to surrender, coach?
Adams County: Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! ...
# 6: Sooo, if we lose we're gonna kill Nelson?
# 7: Oh Jesus, no!
# 3: I don't wanna be a murderer!
Stan: Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
# 7: If we lose are we gonna get cancer?
# 13: Oh no!
# 15: Ohhh..
# 8: Oh no.
# 6: I don't want cancer.
Stan: Let's go, Park! Come on!
Announcer: And that's the end of the game. The result is a tie.
# 10: So did we kill Nelson or not?
Stan: Hello?
Nelson: Coach.
Stan: How are you feeling?
Dr. Doctor: Oh, hello Coach.
Stan: Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?
Dr. Doctor: Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied.
Stan: Oh boy.
Dr. Doctor: He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo.
Stan: But what can I do?
Dr. Doctor: Look! He's coming around again.
Nelson: That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?
Stan: Well, ah, I mean...
Stan: Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.
Nelson: All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.
# 6: Coach! What the hell were you thinking?
# 3: We can't beat Denver County.
Stan: Well, sure we can.
# 6: Last time we played Denver they scored seven times.
Stan: Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?
# 8: No, 'cause they're gonna kill us.
Stan: They're not gonna kill us.
# 6: That's what Steve Irwin said about those stingrays.
# 3: No. In the movies, they always go out and find a kid who's really good to join the team.
# 6: Wow, he's good.
Park County: Yeah!
Kyle: Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.
Park County: Yeah!
Kyle: All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.
Randy: Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.
Stan: Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
Stan: Huh?
Official: The other Pee Wee hockey team didn't show up. There's nobody for you to play. Thanks for makin' the trip though.
Park County: We came to play.
Stan: Sso then we win?
Official: No. Nobody wins.
Official: Well, you've got nobody to play, there's nothing we can do.
Stan: But it isn't supposed to end like this!
Av 2: Yeah.
Official: Well, who are they gonna play?
Av 1: They can take our place.
Av 3: Yeah. Let 'em play the Red Wings.
Av 1: All right! Give 'em hell, boys!
The Avs: All right! Yeah!
Announcer: It's a tie game here in Colorado as we get set to start the final period. Your attention, please: for this third and final period, the Detroit Red Wings will be playing... the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.
Denver Fans: OHHHHHHHHH!
Man: Let them play!
Stan: Hey, can they do that??
Red Wings Coach: Thank you, Dad.
Fans: Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings!
Announcer: And now back to Wheel of Fortune!
Pat Sajak: All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round!
Randy: Thanks, Pat!
Randy: Yeah, they're all rooting for me.
Pat Sajak: And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home?
Randy: Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!
Jimbo: That's us!
Jimbo: Good luck!
Randy: Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
Pat Sajak: And a vowel?
Randy: Uh... Well, uh...
Pat Sajak: Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh.
Randy: I know it but I don't think I should say it.
Pat Sajak: Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.
Sharon: I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.
Randy: What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
Kyle: Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
Cartman: Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
Stan: Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
Kyle: I don't know.
Token: Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning on the news.
Stan: Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
Cartman: Ohhhhhhhh?
Stan: Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
Token: That's easy for you to say, Stan.
Stan: Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
Token: That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
Randy: Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right?
Jesse Jackson: Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists.
Randy: Y-Yes, absolutely.
Randy: Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you.
Randy: Huh?
Jesse Jackson: Apologize. Kiss it.
Randy: You want me to kiss your-
Stan: Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
Token: Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.
Stan: Well, yeah.
Stan: Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!
Butters: A midget?
Woman: Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!
Mr. Nelson: That, that words are like bullets. And if you give-
Randy: Yeah... No problem...
Randy: I just... need some aspirin.
Clerk: You aren't welcome in this store, "nigger" guy.
Mr. Nelson: Principal Victoria, I am very concerned about the behavior of one of your students.
Principal Victoria: Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey: Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson.
Mr. Nelson: You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless.
Mr. Nelson: You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing.
Mr. Nelson: He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking
Cartman: Look, look how its face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
Stan: God dammit!
Mr. Nelson: I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, "Hello, fatso!"
Craig: ...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.
Kids: "Hello, fatso!"
Cartman: Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed it up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
Black Man: Is this "nigger" guy serious?
Driver: Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!
Skeeter: Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.
Skeeter: Where you goin' "nigger" guy?
Randy: Please I, I don't want any trouble.
Skeeter: Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on "Wheel of Fortune"!
Driver: Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, "nigger" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance.
Passenger: You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im!
Passenger: Hey... That's that other "nigger" guy.
Skeeter: Huh?
Driver: Michael Richards? Well, son of a bitch!
Passenger: Mark Fuhrman?
Skeeter: Who?
Passenger: He done said the N-word in the O.J. case.
Richards: We aren't being pushed around anymore. Leave.
Richards: Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee.
Randy: What's going on here?
Scott: They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.
Richards: We're all just like you.
Randy: You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
Randy: No.
Fuhrman: Randy, we want you to join us. We have a plan to make this all go away once and for all.
Stan: Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
Token: I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!
Stan: I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
Token: No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!
Token: Nothing!
Stan: Then stop being mad!
Token: No!
Butters: C'mon now Eric, come on now.
Kyle: Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
Cartman: It's a midget, dude.
Senator 1: "Nigger guy"?
Randy: Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
Richards: Yeah! That's right!
Randy: Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
Senator 2: Uhhh, hold on a second, are you suggesting that "nigger guy" could become a slur that refers to all white people?
Senator 3: I'm certainly not a nigger guy. I've never thought a racist thought.
Most Senators: Aye!
Senator 1: Opposed?
Randy: We did it!
Field Reporter: For the first time in American history, a word has been officially banned from use.
Cartman: Say "Uncle!"
Mr. Nelson: Ung-cle!
Cartman: Hahaha, now say "Carol Anne, don't go into the light!"
Mr. Nelson: Carol Anne, don't go into the light!
Stan: What was his point?
Kyle: I have no idea.
Stan: Dude, I don't get it.
Kyle: I don't get it either.
Kyle: ...Huh?
Token: Thanks, dude.
Kyle: Is this all you brought us here to see?
Kyle: Butters is staying over tonight?
Cartman: Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
Butters: Yeah Kyle?
Cartman: Kyyyle!
Butters: Uh what do you mean?
Kyle: I mean, that if-
Cartman: What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
Butters: Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.
Butters: So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
Cartman: Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
Butters: But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.
Cartman: Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
Stan: What'cha do to Butters this time?
Kyle: Dude!
Stan: Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
Cartman: Because that makes Butters gay now!
Cartman: Eh- ...what?
Kyle: Yeah huh!
Cartman: Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
Cartman: But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
Stan: You are now.
Cartman: No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
Kyle: Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
Stan: You can't!
Kyle: Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
Cartman: How?
Kyle: Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
Cartman: Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
Cartman: It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
Cartman: You ready?
Butters: Y-yeah!
Cartman: Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
Butters: How come uh, I can't see?
Butters: Oh uh, ho yeah.
Butters: Well okay!
Stephen: Butters!
Stephen: Butters! What are you doing?!
Butters: Like what?
Butters: What's... bi-curious?
Linda: What's going on, you two?
Stephen: Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious.
Father Maxi: Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused?
Butters: ...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.
Stephen: You see?
Father Maxi: Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you.
Butters: Really?
Stephen: What can I do, Father?
Father Maxi: There is a special camp where young men who are confused, like your son, can go and be cleansed by the power of God. Many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured.
Stephen: A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.
Butters: Whoa boy! Camp!
Kyle: What are you talking about, fatass?
Kyle: You figured that out, huh?
Kyle: Except for us.
Cartman: Right, except for you.
Kyle: And all the people we tell.
Stan: Because it's really, really funny.
Cartman: ...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
Kyle: Like what?
Stan: That isn't funny.
Kyle: Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Kyle: Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
Leader: Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters.
Campers: Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters.
Director: Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be.
Director: Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?
Butters: Because I'm bi-curious?
Bradley: Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6
Director: Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
Butters: I'm bi-curious.
Bradley: Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22.
Staffer: Aw, darnit!
Cartman: Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
Kyle: Let go of me.
Stan: What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Kyle: Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture.
Kyle: I don't have it.
Kyle: Shut up.
Director: We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you.
Butters: He's bi-curious too?
Director: Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!
Cartman: Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski.
Det. Yates: If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one?
Cartman: It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
Det. Yates: Okay, what is the picture of?
Cartman: All right. It's a picture ...of me.
Det. Yates: Yes?
Cartman: No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
Det. Yates: ...I see.
Cartman: Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep.
Det. Yates: Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury.
Cartman: I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
Det. Yates: Well then, you're screwed.
Director: You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?
Butters: Well sure, I guess.
Bradley: Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.
Director: And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?
Butters: Well yeah, sure.
Bradley: So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7.
Bradley: That's... that's mine.
Director: You know this is strictly forbidden!
Butters: Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
Butters: Yes, it's all very confusing!
Liane: Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.
Cartman: Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
Liane: Oh, now why would he do that?
Cartman: Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
Liane: Ohh, that's nice.
Liane: Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.
Liane: It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.
Cartman: You, you will?
Butters: ...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
Bradley: Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble.
Butters: Awww, that's okay, Bradley.
Bradley: I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused.
Butters: Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
Butters: Wuh-what's the matter?
Bradley: I think, I, I th-, I think I like you.
Butters: Well I like you too, Bradley.
Bradley: You do?
Butters: Well yeah!
Sheila: Hello?
Liane: Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother.
Sheila: Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.
Liane: Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.
Liane: Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.
Liane: You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
Liane: She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
Cartman: Mom, she's lying!
Liane: She said she was sure, Eric.
Cartman: Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
Liane: Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.
Director: Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!
Butters: I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
Director: You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk.
Butters: Oh no, my Dad?
Director: Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you, you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?
Butters: Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
Director: We're fixing your confusion!
Stephen: There you are, Butters!
Director: Oheh- hey Dad.
Stephen: What's he done now?!
Director: Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy!
Director: Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!
Bradley: Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God!
Director: No no, we're fixing you!
Kyle: Ow! Quit it, dude!
Mrs. Garrison: Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first.
Director: Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you!
Bradley: It's too late.
Director: You get back. You're only gonna make things worse.
Bradley: I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!
Butters: You're perfectly normal, Bradley.
Director: Get back! You're just as confused as he is!
Bradley: Yeah.
Bradley: I think. I think I'd like to come down now.
Stephen: Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.
Butters: No. I like bein' bi-curious.
Bebe: Eww!
Cartman: Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
Mrs. Garrison: Eric, what the hell is this?!
Cartman: What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
Mrs. Garrison: All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about.
Bebe: Somebody might have lice?
Class: Ewww!
Mrs. Garrison: So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.
Cartman: Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
Kenny: (What? Fuck you!)
Male Louse: I mean both.
Kelly: Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.
Cartman: This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
Lead Screener: Uh oh, looks like you've got 'em.
Clyde: What?
Lead Screener: You have lice. Let's see... Clyde Harris, is it?
Clyde: Oh my God. Oh Christ no!
Clyde: Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!
Lead Screener: I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel.
Clyde: Yes they are!
President: And what do you base this on?
Travis: If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen!
Older Louse: Poodiggery and poppycock!
Travis: I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation, perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation.
Older Louse: Evacuation?! Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival. Do you know how much money we would lose? Escort Mr. Mayfield out. The President can't be bothered any further.
Clyde: This is so... embarrassing.
Girl: I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for?
Clyde: ...Sick!
Kelly: Travis? Everything okay?
Travis: Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our babih. I want to name her... Hope.
Kelly: Hope?
Kelly: What it, it's just rain.
Kelly: My God, Travis, they're all dying!
Travis: Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!
Louse 4: What the hell is it?!
Kelly: Travis!
Travis: Kellih! Hang on!
Kelly: I can't... hang on!
Kelly: Nooooooooooo!
Mrs. Garrison: Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?
Cartman: Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
Mrs. Garrison: With what?
Mrs. Garrison: Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken.
Stan: Somebody in this class?
Mrs. Garrison: Uh, yes.
Class: Ohhhhh.
Mrs. Garrison: That doesn't matter, it's over.
Red: I wanna know who it was, too.
Mrs. Garrison: It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!
Class: Yeah!
Bebe: And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!
Craig: How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!
Butters: Yeah! Dumb girls!
Travis: How many survivors?
Louse 7: Just the six of us. And the Vice President.
Louse 8: What do we do now?
Craig: Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.
Cartman: Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
Cartman: Me?!
Kyle: This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
Stan: You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
Kyle: Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
Bebe: Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.
Kyle: It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
Clyde: Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
Louse 9: Mark? Mark, you have to hang on.
Travis: This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet.
Louse 8: How?
Louse 9: The forbidden zone... We'll be exposed. We'll die out there.
Travis: We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!
Louse 10: Getting rid of us? You-you mean like it knows what it's doing?
Travis: Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times!
Louse 9: I'm not leaving my husband.
Louse 11: Yeah huh-I'll take my chances here.
Vice President: I wanna go too.
Travis: Not a chance.
Vice President: Look, I know I messed up, all right? But I think you're right. If we can get out of the forest, we might find another place to live.
Jimmy: Ur ur re- ur really?
Cartman: I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
Kyle: Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
Craig: Yeah. That's true.
Jimmy: I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide
Token: Yeah. Me neither.
Kyle: All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
Cartman: Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
Butters: Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
Kyle: It doesn't prove anything!
Clyde: Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.
Cartman: Kenny!
Kyle: No way.
Travis: It's real. Real as my love for my unborn babih.
Vice President: So what exactly is your plan, Travis?
Travis: Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.
Louse 12: Travis. Travis, you're, so wise, so strong. If we make it out of this, I'd like to... be with you.
Louse 12: She was a lucky woman to have you.
Travis: Why you murdering bastard!
Vice President: Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk!
Travis: What the hell do you want, Vice President?!
Clyde: What? What are you gonna do to him?
Cartman: What, Clyde?
Clyde: I... nothing.
Token, Craig: Yeah!
Mrs. Garrison: Yello?
Clyde: Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.
Mrs. Garrison: What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!
Clyde: Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!
Travis: What are you going to do?
Vice President: I'm gonna go back to the village, start to rebuild, mate with the females, become... President!
Travis: Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead!
Vice President: It was a disaster! Disasters happen!
Travis: Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my babih!
Travis: Damn you! Why?!
Cartman: Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
Craig: All right, let's do this!
Clyde: You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?
Kenny: Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!
Clyde: Wait, wait!
Craig: He had cooties and he lied about it!
Clyde: What?
Kyle: I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
Clyde: Wait a-wait a minute, what?
Stan: You had head lice?
Cartman: Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
Craig: I thought I was the only one.
Butters: Me too.
Kenny: Dudes!
Mrs. Garrison: Welcome to our class, Baahir.
Baahir: Thank you.
Mrs. Garrison: Why don't you take a seat in Kyle's empty desk for now?
Cartman: Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
Mrs. Garrison: Eric, that's enough! Not all Muslim people are terrorists!
Cartman: No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
Cartman: Get online. I need you to check something for me.
Kyle: Dude, leave me alone.
Cartman: Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
Cartman: Get online now!
Kyle: Over a hundred.
Kyle: White Stripes
Kyle: What?
Cartman: He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
Barbrady: Hello?
Barbrady: From what? Who is this?
Cartman: I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
Barbrady: Are you serious?
Cartman: If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
Barbrady: Like what?
Cartman: Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
Barbrady: Oh jeez.
Mrs. Garrison: What the hell?
Butters: Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
Kyle: Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
Cartman: Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
Kyle: I guess so.
Cartman: Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
Kyle: Wuh what doesn't follow?
Kyle: Okay.
Cartman: Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
Agent: Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today.
Cartman: Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
Mr. Thompson: What do you know?
Cartman: He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
Mr. Thompson: I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me!
Cartman: I said I will only talk to the President!
Mr. Thompson: Look, if you have information of a threat, you could-
Cartman: LALALALALALALALA!
Mr. Thompson: I will have you arrested for-!
Cartman: LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
Aide: Call is coming through now, Mr. President.
Bush: Hello?
Cartman: President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
Bush: Huh? Who.
Cartman: Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
Bush: Hildog?
Aide: Yes, I understand. I'll let Ms. Clinton know.
Hillary: What is it, Brian?
Brian: Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today.
Hillary: Is the thread credible?
Hillary: No. No, I will not be bullied by terrorist threats. Your men do a good job, Brian. I have faith that any thread will be taken care of accordingly.
Driver: We've reached the rally site, Hildog.
Aide 2: Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Chris: They know about the bomb!
Blond Russian: That is impossible! We took every measure to assure the bomb was hidden from sight.
Chris: Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened.
Blond Russian: That bomb must travel with the Clinton rally to Boston!
Chris: The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!
Blonde Russian: Then we have no choice. We have to move up the attack.
Chris: I understand, comrade.
Blonde Russian: Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour.
Cartman: Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
Kyle: So then maybe you're wrong.
Cartman: Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
Kyle: Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
Cartman: Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
Kyle: God damn it Cartman!
Brian: What?!
Brian: My God, they hid it under the stage?!
Otis: Oh my God. Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...
Mr. Thompson: In her what?
Agent: In her snatch, sir.
Mr. Thompson: What?!
Hillary: What is goin' on? I wasn't finished.
Mr. Thompson: Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson with the CIA. We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch.
Brian: A what?!
Mr. Thompson: A snatch. It's the technical term for vagina.
Brian: No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!
Mr. Waters: Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters. It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke.
Hillary: What is goin' on, Brian?
Brian: Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz.
Brian: What do we do? Can we disable the timer?
Mr. Thompson: It won't have a timer. Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him.
Brian: But then that means...
Mr. Thompson: Yes. If we don't find that detonator, everyone in the town of South Park is going to die. For-ever.
Mr. Thompson: Do we have that phone trace?
Cartman: Yes, Mr. Thompson?
Mr. Thompson: Well, we've just arrived in your town.
Cartman: Why? Did you find something?
Mr. Thompson: Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz.
Mr. Thompson: That's right. It's controlled by a remote detonator. We have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off.
Mr. Thompson: We're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop.
Mr. Thompson: Oh, hey.
Stan: Dude, we totally got let out of school.
Kyle: I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
Stan: Russian?
Stan: So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
Kyle: No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
Stan: Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
Mr. Hakeem: What is going on? What have we done?
Mr. Thompson: They claim they don't know anything about an attack.
Cartman: Big surprise!
Police Officer: Sir, first pass of the house, we didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere.
Mr. Thompson: Mr. Hakeem, where is your son?
Mr. Hakeem: We thought he was at school. He's not at school?
Brian: You're doing great, Ms. Clinton.
Hillary: Do they know how long, Brian? How long before the snuke in my snizz goes off?
Brian: They'll find the detonator, Hildog.
Aide 3: We can't wait for them to find the detonator. If we can get to the bomb, me-maybe we can deactivate it. Can't somebody go and take a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz?
Chris: Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?
Agent 2: Mr. Hakeem, we need to know where your son is!
Mr. Hakeem: I tell you, I do not know.
Cartman: Let me have time with him.
Female Agent: What are you going to do?
Mr. Hakeem: Wuh-what detonator are you ta-
Cartman: You can make it stop!
Kyle: Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
Kyle: Hey.
CIA Vice Head: This apartment is being absorbed by Homeland Security!
Kyle: ...Homeland Security?
CIA Vice Head: Look, your little game of goin' over people's heads is over! You could still work, but from now on you answer to me, you got that?!
FBI Leader: 'Scuse me, who's in charge here?!
CIA Vice Head: I am!
CIA Vice Head: That's outrageous! On whose orders?!
FBI Leader: On order of the Secretary of Defense! You had your shot, now I'm in charge!
Mr. Hakeem: What are you going to do to my wife?!
Cartman: Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
Mrs. Hakeem: We told you: we don't know.
Female Agent: Did he just inject himself with apple juice?
Cartman: Where is your son?!
Mrs. Hakeem: Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!
Mrs. Hakeem: Hallo? Hallo Baahir. Where are you? Who it But-ters?
Cartman: Butters.
Mr. Hakeem: Ogh! You filthy little rapscallion!
Cartman: We got him! I know where he is!
Female Agent: All right, where? We'll send our people in.
Mr. Thompson: You're not going alone.
Kyle: Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
CIA Leader 2: Are you tellin' me how to do my job?
Kyle: Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
CIA Leader 2: Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube and cross-reference it with JDate!
Chase: Checking.
Stan: Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!
CIA Leader 2: Where's the intel from?
Female Agent 2: We just read it on Drudge Report.
Kyle: Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
CIA Leader 2: We do this my way! I'm the one in charge!
Butters: Oh hey Eric.
Baahir: The what?
Cartman: You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
Cartman: Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
EOD Leader: No, it's too dangerous! That snatch has not seen action in over 30 years! It could be toxic!
Cartman: Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
Cartman: That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
Cartman: Uhh yes, of course?
Vladimir: America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?
Cartman: The Russians?
Vladimir: Before that.
Cartman: The Germans?
Vladimir: Before that.
Cartman: The Germans again?
Vladimir: Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!
Cartman: You can't possible mean...?
Queen Elizabeth II: The Russians are ready to set off the diversion. Full sail.
Captain: Full sail, Your Majesty?
Aide 3: All right, Brian, this is it. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch.
EOD Leader: God help him.
Aide 3: What do you see, Brian?
Brian: It's dark... cold...
Aide 3: You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as you can... Y-you have to look inside the snizz.
Aide 3: You're doin' great, Brian. Hang in there.
Aide 3: Say again, Brian.
Brian: Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!
EOD Leader: Brian? Brian, what's happening?
Hillary: Hoh my!
Kyle: I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
Female Agent 2: The British?
Agent 4: Loyalist Red Coats!
Chase: Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account! It does list an address in South Park!
Kyle: All right! MapQuest the address!
Chase: I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.
Kyle: Good thinking
CIA Leader 2: Sir, we have the terrorists' location. IM'ing you now.
Baahir: Please. Think about what you are doing. The British are just using you; you're going to die.
Vladimir: Yes, but we will be rich.
Vladimir: How did they find us?
Mr. Thompson: We know about everything! Your diversion to help the Red Coats is over!
Agent: The power went out!
Vladimir: Oh crap.
Captain: The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!
Soldier: How?
Queen Elizabeth II: Yes?
Captain: Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution.
Kyle: Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
Cartman: Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
Baahir: Really?
Cartman: Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
Kyle: ...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
Cartman: But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
Cartman: Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
Kyle: ...That is so missing the point.
Cartman: Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
Kyle: The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
Cartman: Yes or no, Kyle?!
Kyle: No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
Butters: Awwwww.
Randy: [inside] ...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
Stan: Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
Randy: Wha... what do you mean, "Why do we do this?" It's Easter!
Randy: Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.
Stan: Yeah, but why?
Randy: Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.
Stan: So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
Randy: That's right.
Randy: Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!
Randy: What is wrong with him?!
Cartman: And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
Mall Bunny: Ahh, don't you think that's-
Cartman: Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
Stan: All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
Mall Bunny: Huh?
Mall Bunny: Look, kid ahh, I'm j-, I'm just a guy in a costume.
Stan: I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
Mall Bunny: Huhuh, Easter's just Easter. Just, just go with it, kid.
Randy: Hang on, I'm taking a crap.
Stan: Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!
Randy: What?
Gray Hare: Randy?
Randy: Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
Purple Hare: Ohhh.
Randy: Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
Randy: I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!
Stan: Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
Randy: Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.
Randy: I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
Stan: Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
Randy: Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!
Stan: So what is the secret of Easter?
Randy: I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.
Randy: I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.
Stan: Grandpa's in it too?
Randy: Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
Stan: Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
Randy: You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.
Randy: Dammit.
Hare 1: Hey Bill.
Hare 2: Evenin' Marcus.
Hare 3: Heh heh hey, look at you!
Hare 4: Hey everybody.
Hare 5: Stan Marsh, welcome! You must be very excited.
Stan: Must I?
Marvin: There he is! There's my grandson!
Stan: Hi Grandpa.
Marvin: I'm proud of ya, Billy.
Stan: ...Stan.
Pink Hare: Tonight, we determine if a new member is worthy of protecting the Secret. Bring out... the rabbit.
Pink Hare: All hail the cute rabbit, Snowball!
Pink Hare: Stan Marsh, are you ready to hear the secret of Easter?
Stan: Yeah.
Randy: Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.
Stan: Yeah, I wanna know already.
Stan: Where am I supposed to go?
Layman: Where is the rabbit?!
Hare 6: Where are you taking us?
Stan: Help.
Kyle: What happened?
Stan: My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
Kyle: ...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
Kyle: Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.
Randy: Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?
Randy: You...
Kyle: The history of Easter.
Stan: Just bread...
Kyle: It kind of looks like... an egg.
Kyle: Who is Saint Peter?
Stan: He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
Teabag: Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely.
Kyle: I don't see it.
Stan: He looks like a guy.
Kyle: I don't believe it.
Teabag: Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive.
Kyle: So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
Pope Benedict: You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit?
Randy: You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
Pope Benedict: Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell!
Randy: It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
Layman: I'm sorry I couldn't bring you the rabbit, Your Holiness, but they know where it is!
Pope Benedict: The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?!
Randy: I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.
Layman: Take him to be tortured!
Pope Benedict: Tortured, huh, but Bill, all this... torturing and ninjas, it just doesn't seem very Christian.
Randy: No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!
Stan: I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
Stan: They found me!
Kyle: So what now?
Stan: If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
Kyle: You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
Kyle: I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
Announcer: Live, from the Vatican, it's our Easter Vigil coverage.
Pope Benedict: Bill, this seems extreme.
Bill: The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.
Italian Cardinal: Your Holiness, a child has arrived with a the rabbit!
Randy: Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!
Pope Benedict: Yes, hand it over!
Stan: First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
Pope Benedict: We promise.
Bill: We swear it, on the cross.
Randy: Just hand over the bunny, Stan!
Stan: You said "hand over the bunny."
Randy: No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
Stan: Hey, what the hell!
Pope Benedict: Bill, we have zeh rabbit, it's all we need.
Bill: Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These "whores" must be punished in front of everyone!
Kyle: You swore on the cross, fatso!
Randy: Oh, we should've seen that coming!
Pope Benedict: Bill, I'm not sure that double-crossing people is very Christian.
Bill: It is what Christ would've wanted!
Pope Benedict: It... can't be.
Singer: He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!
Cardinal: Jesus, we thought you died. In Iraq.
Jesus: I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.
Jesus: Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan.
Purple Hare 2: Ohh, that's me Neato!
Bill: Kill him!
Pope Benedict: What?!
Bill: He goes against the Church. He must die!
Pope Benedict: All right, that does it, Bill. I'm pretty sure that killing Jesus is not very Christian.
Pope Benedict: I am the Pope!
Jesus: What is your problem, guy?!
Reporter: A strange turn of events here at the Vatican: Pope Benedictus has stepped down, ushering the new era of... Pope Bill Donohue
Pope Benedict: Forgive me, Jesus.
Jesus: We'll never get out in time to stop him!
Kyle: Don't you have any superpowers?
Kyle: What?
Kyle: N-no way! Do it yourself.
Jesus: Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!
Kyle: Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
Jesus: My son, there is no time! Do it!
Kyle: Eric Cartman can never know about this.
Jesus: I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter.
Kyle: ...Jesus?
Cardinal: Sorry, little bunny.
Tourist: Jesus?
Jesus: Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent!
Bill: Why won't you go away?!
Jesus: One man cannot be the voice of the Church!
Bill: Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!
Crowd: YAAAY!
Stan: All right Jesus!
Italian Cardinal: Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it.
Randy: Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.
Stan: Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
Randy: That's my boy.
Kyle: Oh God, here we go again.
Mrs. Garrison: All men care about is sex! I spent two hours getting ready for that stupid date! And when the bastard checks out my body, he just says, "Hey, did you used to be a guy or somethin'?" I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!
Stan: Uh oh, this isn't good.
Cartman: Have you lost your mind?
Stan: Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
Mrs. Garrison: Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done!
Butters: But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
Mrs. Garrison: If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?!
Stan: Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
Kyle: Our whole weekend is shot.
Kenny: (What the hell are we going to do?!)
Cartman: You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
Stan: We don't?
Cartman: No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
Cartman: Que paso? Que paso? Looking for work? S? Trabajo?
Laborer 2: Okay.
Laborer 1: Sure.
Cartman: Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.
Laborer 2: Okay no problem. That's no problem.
Laborer 1: Yeah, we can do that.
Laborer 5: S, la samuraisia.
Cartman: Okay, gracias.
Stan and Kyle: Gracias.
Stan: Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
Cartman: Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
Woman: Are you okay, hon?
Woman: Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious.
Mrs. Garrison: Tell me about it! I can't even stretch at a normal gym without some guy trying to stare down my vage.
Woman: I'm Allyson.
Mrs. Garrison: Oh, I'm Janet. Janet Garrison. Sorry I'm so pissed off.
Allyson: No, I like it. You seem like a very strong woman.
Janet: Yeah, I've been told that.
Allyson: How come I've never seen you down at the girl bar?
Allyson: Oh you'd love it. It's the only bar in town where women like us can hang out and be ourselves. It's called "Lebow".
Allyson: Hi Linda, hi Kate.
Woman 2: Hey Allyson.
Woman 3: Who's the new girl?
Woman 2: Allyson always goes for the butch ones.
Janet: Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.
Janet: He-yeah. Done what?
Allyson: Yeah. I... thought you understood that.
Allyson: I'm sorry. I thought you knew what "girl bar" meant.
Allyson: Janet, I'm really sorry. It's just that at the gym you said you didn't like being with men, so I thought you were a-
Janet: I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!
Allyson: Have you... never even... thought... of being... with another woman?
Allyson: There are a lot of ways to make love, Janet.
Janet: I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.
Janet: Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!
Janet: Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson!
Allyson: Janet, you're crazy!
Janet: Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!
Kyle: They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
Laborers: S, s.
Kyle: What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
Laborer 1: Eet starts there the old man, and his job is to catch the feesh, so he get in the boht, to try and catch feesh.
Laborer 2: Saw he catch the feesh, but the feesh is very strong, so the old man, cannot reel in the feesh.
Laborer 5: So then he fight the feesh. Some more. And he finally catch the feesh.
Kyle: He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
Stan: That's it, that's the whole story?
Laborer 1: S.
Cartman: All right, did you write the four essays?
Cartman: Okay, let's have 'em.
Laborer 4: Have what?
Kyle: You said you all wrote essays.
Laborer 1: Well, my ese lives in Miami. I wrote to him like you said, but I don't think he got the letter yet.
Laborer 2: I wrote my ese in Albuquerque.
Kenny: (Uh oh...)
Kyle: Dude, we're totally fucked now!
Cartman: Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
Laborer 1: We thought it was kind of strange.
Kyle: This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
Stan: You guys, school starts in ten minutes!
Kyle: Jimmy, did you finish your book report?
Kyle: We're dead.
Cartman: Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
Stan: Again?
Butters: You have to be careful with scissors.
Cartman: That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
Class: Yay!
Tracy: Hi Janet.
Janet: Hey Patty.
Patty: What's up, Janet.
Lesbian 4: You guys. You guys, stop it. Listen to me, everybody. I got some bad news.
Lesbian 5: What is it, Katie?
Katie: They're closing down the bar. For good!
Linda: Closing it down? They can't do that.
Janet: Yeah, this is our home.
Katie: Well it's true, I just talked to the owners. They've sold the bar to Persians.
Janet: Persians?!
Tracy: So where are we supposed to go?
Janet: We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!
Janet: Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!
Mayor McDaniels: You're a lesbian now?
Janet: That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!
Mayor McDaniels: The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.
Janet: Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!
Lesbians: Yeah, that's right!
Mayor McDaniels: I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.
Mayor McDaniels: Mrs. Garrison, get out of here.
Tracy: Well, here's to some great times at this place.
Lesbian 7: Yeah. Guess we'll just have to find somewhere else to hang out.
Janet: Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!
Allyson: Well, what are we supposed to do, Janet?
Janet: We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them "We aren't leaving Les Bos."
Katie: Actually, it's "Lebow".
Emir: Hello, my name is Emir Hadi. My boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar.
Lesbian 6: Yes, we are.
Emir: Well, we want to assure you that when this place becomes another Club Persh, you will all still be 100% welcome. All they want is to make the place really nice. We're going to put down some lovely blue carpet, and gold curtain rods.
Janet: I knew it! I knew it!
Emir: But you are still welcome to come. My boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way.
Janet: Would you allow straight people in? Men?
Emir: Well... we would allow whoev-
Emir: Look uhh, we don't have to offer you anything, so... I don't know why you're being so difficult. This is crazy.
Emir: Ohhhhh!
Anchor: As a group of lesbians in Colorado are refusing to allow the new owners of their bar in.
Lesbian 8: Good for them!
Narrator: The Persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in.
Narrator: The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the Persians from entering.
Big Woman: There's so many of them.
Persian 2: Lesbians! Stand aside. We're coming in to redecorate it!
Janet: The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!
Persian 2: All right! Come on! They can't stop all of us! Huuu!
Persian 2: Come on, seriously, let us in!
Janet: Never!
Janet: Lesbohhhs!
Lesbians: Huok! Huok!
Narrator: The Persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss.
Persian 2: Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move. We could not get inside to redecorate.
Narrator: And with that the Persian club owner came to a realization.
Xerxes: I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself.
Janet: Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.
Allyson: Well that's great, Janet, but what now? We can't just stay here pushing them away our whole lives.
Janet: We can't? I think it's pretty fun.
Linda: We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.
Janet: Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.
Allyson: Whattaya mean?
Janet: If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!
Allyson: But who's gonna spy on them for us? We don't know any Persians.
Janet: It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.
Janet: Que paso? Que paso? Looking for work? S? Trabajo?
Laborer 1: Yeis.
Laborer 2: We looking work, s.
Janet: All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.
Laborer 2: Okay.
Laborer 1: Sure.
Allyson: Janet, how is this gonna work? They don't look Persian.
Lesbian 6: Wow!
Janet: All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.
Laborer 1: Okay.
Laborer 5: No problem.
Laborer 2: Yes.
Janet: And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.
Janet: Take positions, Lesbos!
Janet: No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.
Linda: Really?
Allyson: How can you tell?
Janet: Let them through. It's okay.
Laborer 3: Hola, como estas?
Laborer 4: Hola.
Janet: Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?
Laborer 4: Ahh, no. They're not doing anything illegal.
Janet: A-are you sure?
Laborer 1: No, but we did find out a kind of secret about the person in charge.
Laborers: S.
Allyson: Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here. He wants to talk to you and you alone.
Janet: It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.
Xerxes: Why are you lesbians being so difficult?
Janet: Because we're protecting the only home we have.
Xerxes: I don't know why you have to be all superlame about this.
Janet: You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.
Janet: I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.
Xerxes: You don't understand. Women can't be the boss in Persian culture. Nobody can know about this.
Xerxes: You do? Seriously?
Janet: Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?
Janet: Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!
Xerxes: Ohh, that feels so supercool!
Janet: Yeah, scissor!
Xerxes: Ohh, I'm a new woman!
Narrator: And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails.
Janet: Thanks for everything, Xerxes.
Xerxes: No. Thank you, friend.
Allyson: Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now?
Janet: The school hired a substitute to cover for me.
Laborer 2: S.
Laborers: S. S. Yes. Yes. That's right.
Laborer 4: S.
Stan: These guys are pretty good.
Cartman: All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
Kyle: Fine.
Bum: Spare some change?
Kyle: Really?
Cartman: Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
Stan: Yeah, it's all set.
Clyde: He won't make it.
Kyle: Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
Bum: Oh! Aww.
Kenny: (Yehes!)
Kyle: God damn it, that wasn't my idea!
Fire Chief: Well, I, I short of had an idea.
Mayor McDaniels: Please, Mr. Valmer.
Other Members: Oh, that's a good one. Good idea. I like it.
Randy: Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.
Mr. Valmer: Ohh, that's a good one.
Mr. Mackey: Nice one, Randy.
Gerald: Like it.
Aide: That's like recycling.
Mrs. Testaburger: All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me!
Randy: You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.
Homeless Advisor: Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more.
Bum: Got any more?
Stan: Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
Kyle: I don't know.
Cartman: There's a bunch outside my house too.
Stan: I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
Kyle: He did?
Cartman: Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
Kyle: Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
Cartman: You what?!
Stan: Kyle, what were you thinking?
Kyle: I don't want you to jump them, retard!
Bum 1: Spare some change?
Randy: No, sorry, I don't have any change.
Randy: No!
Bum 7: Spare some change?
Bum 7: All right, God bless you, sir.
Randy: I just gave you change!
Gerald: Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.
Jimbo: Randy? Randy, what happened?
Announcer: This is a News 5 Special Bulletin, with Chris Swollenballs.
Randy: Help! Help us!
Stan: Dude, it's our dads.
Kyle: Oh my God.
Chris Swollenballs: In the meantime, South Park citizens are being advised to stay indoors and protect their change.
Chris Swollenballs: What the? You can't be in here.
Bum 9: Ya got any change, sir?
Chris Swollenballs: No I don't have any change. How did he get in here?
Bum 10: Chaaaaange?
Cartman: You see what you did, Kyle?!
Cartman: They're everywhere!
Stan: Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
Cartman: Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
Stephen: And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere.
Gerald: If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.
Bums: Change? Change sir? You got some change?
Bum 12: Change, sir?
Stephen: What happened?
Homeless Advisor: Go away, I I don't have any change.
Stan: Are you the head of Homeless Studies?
Homeless Advisor: Yes. Who are you?
Stan: There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
Cartman: All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
Homeless Advisor: Jump them?
Cartman: I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
Kyle: Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
Cartman: I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
Kyle: You barely made it over one, fatass!
Stan: Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
Kyle: God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
Randy: We don't have any change! Go away!
Linda: Anything, Stephen?
Randy: Find another place to hide, Steve!
Steve: I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.
Stephen: We can't just leave them out there.
Steve: Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change.
Linda: You have to let them in, Randy.
Randy: There isn't enough food for more people up here!
Stephen: This isn't happening!
Bum 13: Could you spare some change, sir?
Homeless Advisor: They feed on our change. They need it in order to keep them moving
Bum 14: Is that... is that some spare change?
Homeless Advisor: Somehow they're able to take... our change... and turn it into nourishment, sustenance.
Bum 14: Spare some of that change, sir?
Bum 14: Spare some change?
Bum 15: Chaaaaange?
Kyle: What's it doing?
Homeless Advisor: It's dying.
Cartman: Cool.
Homeless Advisor: I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did. And they were able to stop it.
Homeless Advisor: Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!
Cartman: Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
Bum 16: Change?
Bum 17: Spare some change?
Bum 18: Change?
Gerald: Stop it! I really do need change!
Bum 16: Me too. Change?
Jimbo: No. We can't be.
Randy: Face it, we're gonna starve!
Linda: No, no wait, there's still a box over here.
Randy: Those are cherry! Ich!
Gerald: What? You do?
Randy: How? Call the fire department.
Linda: Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay.
Stephen: Ask her what's happening.
Jimbo: What happened, Glen?
Linda: Randy, what are you doing?
Randy: He's homeless now. We aren't safe.
Glen: I'm not like them.
Randy: Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
Randy: If we have to! Siddown Glen!
Glen: Randy, you can't just-
Randy: SIT... doowwwnnnn!
Stan: We, just came to ask a question.
Man 2: You homeless or homeowners?
Kyle: We're nine.
Man 1: Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!
Stan: Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
Cartman: Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
Kyle: Shut up, Cartman!
Man 1: Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
Cartman: Youu heard about that?
Cartman: Thirty was hard enough.
Stan: Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
Cartman: Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.
Man 1: That's right, yes.
Stan: What?
Man 1: And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!
Man 1: Right. But we survived.
Christine: You sonothatitch! You tried to kinn me!
Dennis: I had to, Christine, you were homeless.
Christine: No, I wasn't honeless yeh stukid asshole!
Dennis: Christine, I can't understand you.
Christine: Yeah! Gecause you durned my yits oth!
Dennis: I nurned your rip sauce?
Christine: No! You durned my yits oth!
Stan: Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
Stan: No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
Kyle: That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
Kenny: (What are you gonna do?)
Kyle: We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
Randy: A bus! A bus is coming!
Stephen: I knew they'd come back for us!
Linda: All right!
A Woman: Yeah.
Stan: All right, I'm turning around
Stephen: Why are they turning?
Kyle: All right, hit it.
Stephen: They're... they're leading them away!
Jimbo: We're gonna be all right!
Gerald: Cha-a-ange?
Bum: Eughuhuh.
Stan: Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.
Mom: Yes, I'm sorry. My son has Tourette's Syndrome.
Clerk: Tourette's Syndrome?
Mom: It's a neurological disorder. He-he can't control what he says.
Clerk: Oh...
Thomas: All right Mom- Bitch! Ass bitch!
Thomas: No. Cocknose!
Cartman: What's your problem, kid?!
Cartman: What?
Mom: People with Tourette's can't control certain tics. It's it's like a sneeze.
Thomas: Asshole ASSHOLE.
Mom: It's okay, Thomas. They understand.
Man 1: Poor kid.
Clerk: Yeah.
Clerk: It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.
Clerk: Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?
Liane: It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.
Cartman: Puh- pussy!
Liane: Oh...
Liane: Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?
Doctor: That doesn't seem likely. Tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.
Cartman: ...Cocksucker!
Cartman: Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
Liane: Oh Doctor, can you help him?
Cartman: But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
Doctor: Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve.
Cartman: Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!
Kyle: Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?
Butters: Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
Kyle: What?
Principal Victoria: It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.
Kyle: You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!
Kyle: Who cares about saying whatever you-?
Cartman: Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
Craig: If I could say "asspussy" to the counselor I would be sooo happy.
Mrs. Garrison: Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?
Cartman: Dicktits!
Mrs. Garrison: Ih if we apply what we've just learned, we see that all negatives can-
Cartman: Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
Kyle: Will you knock it off already?!
Cartman: Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
Kyle: Don't push me, asshole!
Mrs. Garrison: Principal Victoria, it's just that Eric has become such a distraction I, I don't think I can teach my class anymore.
Cartman: Kyle please! I'm sorry!
Kyle: Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
Mr. Donaldson: This is the kind of intolerance you teach at this school, Principal Victoria?!
Principal Victoria: No.
Mr. Donaldson: You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!
Kyle: L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
Thomas: Aw shit!
Kyle: Dude...
Mr. Donaldson: Your mom would not be better off if you were dead, Thomas. Even if people like Kyle here think so.
Kyle: Aw, come on!
Mr. Donaldson: So then you apologize for what you said before?
Sheila: Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.
Gerald: Well Kyle?
Cartman: Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
Cartman: You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
Sheila: Oh, thank you Eric.
Announcer: Next week on Dateline NBC: it's a Dateline special report.
Hansen: Go ahead and take a seat. Take a seat right over there.
Predator: Oh God, Whoa no.
Hansen: What are you doin' here?
Predator: I'm just' bein' stupid, I guess.
Hansen: But now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to Tourette's Syndrome. It all started when I received this touching letter from a brave little boy in Colorado.
Dr. Doctor: Well, what food have you been eating?
Randy: How painful is "painful"?
Randy: Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
Sharon: Randy!
Stan: No way!
Randy: Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?
Stan: No, never.
Sharon: Why?!
Sharon: No, we are flushing the toilet right now-
Randy: Hey guys!
Gerald: Hey Randy.
Stephen: Oh, hey Randy.
Stuart: Are you feelin' better?
Randy: Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.
Jimbo: You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.
Randy: I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
Stuart: A football? That's amazing.
Stephen: I've never heard of one that big.
Stuart: Oh my freaking Lord.
Skeeter: That did not seriously come out of your ass.
Randy: Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.
Gerald: Jesus...
Gerald: It's... other-worldly.
Stephen: Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!
Sharon: What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!
Randy: The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.
Sharon: Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!
Chubby Official: It appears to be legitimate, based on the photo. We estimate that the crap is over eight and a half Courics!
EFSM President: Hm, enshnusen?
Chubby Official: Verron snusunarich.
EFSM President: What was your primary diet for this poo, Mr. Marsh?
Randy: Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
Chubby Official: I believe I detect some cabbage as well?
Randy: Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.
EFSM President: It is a tremendous crap, Mr. Marsh.
Sharon: For the love of God!
EFSM President: Your crap officially weighs... 8.6 Courics
Randy: Courics...
Chubby Official: The standard measuring unit for human feces. One Katie Couric is approximately two and a half pounds of excrement.
EFSM President: The current record is a crap weighing 7.5 Courics.
Randy: But that means...
Third Official: That's right. You are the new world's champion!
EFSM President: Well, I guess we'd better call the old champion and let him know his record has just been broken.
EFSM President: Yes, Bono, sir, we wish to inform you that your record for biggest crap has just been broken.
Bono: What?! That's impossible! How big was it?
Randy: Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!
Broloff: Thank you, Senator. For over a hundred years, the European Fecal Standards and Meas-
People in Crowd: Oh! Bono? Cool!
Broloff: Could we play the tape on the big screen, please?
Crowd: Whoa!
Man: Bo-no! Woo-ooo!
Stan: Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.
Stan: Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.
Sharon: Come on guys, lasagna's ready.
Sharon: What are you talking about?
Sharon: Randy, this is ridiculous!
Sharon: Wha? Wha?
Stuart: 'Cause he's Bono, that's why.
Stephen: But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!
Randy: Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
Randy: Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
Skeeter: Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy!
Stuart: With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?
Stephen: Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!
Gerald: That's what we're here for.
Jimbo: Come on, Randy, what do you say?!
Anchorman: Tonight, a possible attack on Iran may mean the beginning of a new war in the Middle East.
Sharon: Oh no.
Anchorman: But first, the record for the world's biggest crap: will it again be broken?
Female Anchor: Is this really newsworthy?
Anchorman: You just don't understand.
Female Anchor: You're right. I don't.
Bono: Hello, hello.
Broloff: Marsh is attempting to break the record again. We thought you should know.
Bono: He can't beat my nine and a half Courics!
Broloff: Well he's going to try.
Bono: Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich.
Broloff: Bono, we've never had that rule before.
Bono: I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!
Randy: Oooooo.
Stephen: That's great, Randy!
Randy: Can I, can I see it?
Randy: Ahhh...
Randy: In Zurich?
Gerald: They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
Assistant: I'm sorry Mr. Marsh, I I cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition. It is never safe to fly during your turd trimester.
Stan: Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?
Stan: Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
Bono: Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?
Stan: That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
Bono: I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.
Stan: All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
Stan: Agh!
Bono: Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!
Stan: I take it back!
Bono: Say I'm not number two!
Stan: You're not number two!
Stan: What is wrong with that guy?
Chubby Official: It must be quite a crap.
Stan: What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
Butler: Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before!
Stan: So?
Stan: He's the record.
Assistant: The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean!
Randy: But then, does it still count?
Bono: Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out!
Broloff: I believe that's true. We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but, if you cannot crap out the crap, it's not really a crap.
Jimbo: There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.
Randy: I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.
Broloff: Well congratulations, Bono, it appears your record is intact.
Bono: I had a feeling it would be.
Bono: Get him out of here!
Third Official: What are you talking about, young man?
Stan: Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
Bono: It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!
Broloff: It's too late, Bono. The boy has learned the truth.
Chubby Official: Herr Broloff, what do you know of this?
Bono: Poppa no! Say nothing more!
Bono: No Poppa... No Poppa...
Stan: Dude.
Broloff: My little crap has accomplished many things. But he could never shed the fact that he was really... a number two. So he spent his life trying to be number one, in everything.
Stan: That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
Chubby Official: You have blemished this noble society's good name, Herr Broloff.
Third Official: My God...
Chubby Official: It must be over a hundred Courics!
Stan: Dad, are you all right?
Kyle: This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
Kyle: Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
Kyle: This is fucking retarded!
Cartman: Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
Cartman: It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
Kyle: You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
Stan: Dude...
Jimmy: Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun.
Butters: Wow.
Stan: Cool.
Craig: No way.
Token: Whoa.
Jason: Wow.
Leprechaun: You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!
Craig: Dude.
Stan: What is this place?
Fanciful Mayor: This... is Imaginationland.
The Boys: Butters.
General Deckter: Terrorists have just attacked... our imagination.
Butters: Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
Butters: Huh?
Fanciful Mayor: NO! You passed out and peed your pants!
Stan: Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
Kyle: We just... went on a balloon ride.
Specialist: There must have been some kind of portal or doorway.
Stan: Dude, we don't remember.
Specialist: It was the Chinese, wasn't it?
Kyle: ...What?
Stan: No.
General Deckter: That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?
Specialist: It is better than ours?
Stan: Your what?
Kyle: Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
General Deckter: Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?!
General Deckter: THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!
Stan: If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
Elderly woman: You okay, kid?
Cartman: NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
General Deckter: Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called "Project Imagination Doorway."
Stan: That's not very imaginative.
General Deckter: According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has.
Lead tech: But we're close, sir. We're real close.
General Deckter: They've been saying that for over forty years.
Kyle: Ah I guess.
Lead tech: What was the sequence that got you inside? We know there's some kind of... resonance code, but we can't figure it out.
Kyle: Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
General Deckter: Song? You didn't say anything about a song before.
Lead tech: What song?
Stan: The Imagination song?
Lead tech: That could be it. The fractal converter has never worked because it was waiting for a multitonal code!
General Deckter: Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go?
Operator: Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something.
Kyle: No, no dude, it went up there.
Lollipop King: Mayor, Mayor, what are we supposed to do?
Fanciful Mayor: Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times.
Butters: Really?
Snarf: Mayor, what are we supposed to do, shnarf shnarf?
Fanciful Mayor: Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope!
Lollipop King: Castle Sunshine?
Orc: We are free! Now all of Imaginationland is ours!
The Minotaur: Not all, foolish orc! There are still parts of Imaginationland we don't control.
Freddy Krueger: Tomorrow, we shall build our own castle right on this spot!
The Minotaur: Who put you in charge, Krueger?! I am the most evil character here!
Critter: Yeah. You're all right, Squirrelly Squirrel.
Woodland Critters: Yaaaay!
The Minotaur: What evil imaginary characters are they?
Creature from the Black Lagoon: They were dreamt up by some fourth grade kid as part of his Christmas Story..
Squirrelly Squirrel: Now come on y'all. We can't waste time arguing, there could still be survivors out there. We need to hunt them down, and kill them.
Rabbity Rabbit: And eat their flesh!
Beavery Beaver: B'hut first we should rape them!
Beary Bear: How about we kill them, and then rape their bodies so we can use their blood as lubricant?
Cartman: Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
Cartman: Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
Stan: Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
Lead tech: It's open! It's open!
General Deckter: All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!
Butters: How much further to Castle Sunshine?
Butters: What was that?
Strawberry Shortcake: Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah!
The Minotaur: Now kill her!
Freddy Krueger: What do you mean? We cut out her eyeball.
Jason Voorhees: Yeah, that's super hardcore.
Squirrelly Squirrel: Now come on y'all. We can do better than that.
Beavery Beaver: Hey! I know! Let's all pee in her empty eye socket!
Deery Deer: Let's make her eat her own eyeball, and then pee in her empty eyesocket.
The Minotaur: Nobody here has AIDS!
Woodland Critters: Awwww!!
Beary Bear: But we've got to have AIDS before we pee in her eyesocket!
General Deckter: All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready?
Soldiers: Yes sir!
General Deckter: Are you ready, Kurt Russell?
General Deckter: Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard!
Tech 1: Sir, we have a security breach!
General Deckter: What?!
Tech: There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
Kyle: Cartman??
General Deckter: Who the hell are you?!
Cartman: That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
General Deckter: Get him out of here!
Kyle: I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
General Deckter: All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here.
Deckter: You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it.
Cartman: Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
Kyle: I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government!
Kyle: Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
Kyle: Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
Kyle: Just get to it already!
Lead tech: Entering the portal in five seconds.
General Deckter: Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?
Kurt Russell: Check 1, 2.
Tech 3: They are inside the imagination, sir.
Lead tech: Awww, an imaginary talking squirrel.
Techs: Awww.
General Deckter: Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack.
Kurt Russell: Wait a minute, eh. The squirrel has friends. Oh why, why it's a whole bunch of woodland critters.
Kurt Russell: There's a talking bear and a beaver, uh... the, they seem to be Christmas critters. Well hello. Yes, hi.
Stan: Get them out of there!
General Deckter: What?
Stan: Tell them to get away now!
General Deckter: What's the matter?
Kurt Russell: Oh the... cute little bear's eyes are starting to glow red now... Uh hello there, little animals, do you happen to know how to huh? OW! AAAAAAAHHHH!
General Deckter: Kurt Russell, what's going on?!
Kurt Russell: They're raping mee!! They're raping meee!!!
General Deckter: Get out of there, Kurt Russell!
Kurt Russell: They're raping all of us! Whoaho! Oh it hurts! They're raping us and it huuurts! Waaagh!
Cartman: I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
Kyle: Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
Guard: Everyone to the main hall now! Go!
Cartman: Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
Cartman: No! Goddammit no!
Snarf: Boy snarf snarf, my feet are really gettin' tired snarf.
Butters: Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?
Perseus: What imaginary character are you?!
Lollipop King: The Lollipop King? From the Lollipop Forest?
Snarf: And I'm Snarf. Snarf, snarf snarf snarf.
Butters: Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
Perseus: What's a "Butters"?
Snarf: The Mayor brought him and some other kids into Imaginationland just before the terrorist attack.
Perseus: So YOU came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists! That seems like quite a coincidence!
Butters: I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
Perseus: You caught the Leprechaun? Take him!
Snarf: Perseus! He's not against us snarf snarf!
Operator: What is it?!
Tech 4: Its like a... half man half bear!
General Deckter: Reverse the doorway! Send it back through!
Butters: Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
Perseus: That is for the Council of Nine to decide!
Lollipop King: Don't worry, kid, the Council of Nine consists of some of the most highly-regarded imaginary characters in all Imaginationland
Aslan: Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate.
Zeus: Yes. Their power outmatches ours. If they are giving us a chance to leave we must take it!
Aslan: And what say you, Morpheus?
Morpheus: How our we to know that they will let us go? Their offer could be a trap.
Glinda: Perhaps we must flee to the Temple of Alderon. Surely they wouldn't chase us there.
Perseus: Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but this boy has infiltrated from the real world.
Aslan: Bring him here!
Paramedic: I'm sorry, young man.
Cartman: Kyle?
Paramedic: Well... at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls.
General Deckter: He's gone, little boy.
Paramedic: Charging.
Paramedic: Clear.
Aslan: I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.
Zeus: What are you saying, Aslan? That if we are to take back control, we might-?
Morpheus: Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key.
Butters: Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
Luke Skywalker: If you ever wanna see your home again, little boy, you'll have to rise to this challenge.
Butters: But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
Aslan: It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right.
Tom: Sir? Are you sure about this?
Aslan: You have a power here that you have yet to understand.
Official 1: Yes, we see it, Mr. Gore.
Doctor: He's recovering, but there's been some trauma to his brain. The boy says he's been hearing imaginary voices.
Stan: Hello?
Kyle: Stan?
Kyle: Cartman, what's happened?
Kyle: No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
Kyle: Arh!
Kyle: Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
Kyle: Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
Aslan: Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!
Butters: What powers? Ah I don't understand.
Gandalf: You are real. You are a creator. That means you can imagine things into existence here.
Butters: I c-I can?
Aslan: Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.
Butters: How?
Glinda: You just have to focus your mind. Imagine Santa and nothing else.
Butters: How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
Luke Skywalker: Think only of one thing. Imagine it. Believe in it.
Butters: I'm trying!
Zeus: You must believe in Santa!
Aslan: BELIEVE IN SANTA! RIGHT NOW!
Butters: GAA HAA!
Cartman: Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
Kyle: Cartman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
General Deckter: We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild.
Reporter 1: Our imaginations are running wild and we weren't told?!
General Deckter: By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination.
Reporter 2: Is nuking our imagination really prudent?
Reporter 3: Aren't there other, more peaceful ways to get our imagination under control?
Reporter 4: Couldn't we trying sending Kurt Russell into a portal to our imagination to try and reason with the-
General Deckter: We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters!
Reporter 5: ...A-ooch
Anchorman: The Pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real, the military doesn't need Senate approval to nuke them.
Hippie 1: That's bullcrap, man! You can't nuke our imagination!
Hippie 2: Don't nuke our imagination bro! WOOO!
Anchorman: Mike, does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination?
Anchorman: Yes, I believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiff's balls in that case.
Mike: That's right, Steven, yeah.
Kyle: Oh for the love of God!
Stan: Hello? Can anybody hear me?
Kyle: Stan! Dude, is that you?
Stan: Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
Kyle: No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
Stan: ...Oh that makes sense.
Kyle: Dude, what's happening?
Aslan: There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW!
Butters: Santa. Saaanta.
Luke Skywalker: Think. Jolly old Santa. Red suit, white beard.
Cartman: How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
General Deckter: Thank you.
Kyle: Oh no.
Chief Justice: This of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past, including the famous Cartman v. Broflovski ballsucking case.
Cartman: ...What?
Steven: So it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation, one they are calling "Operation Nuke the Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway."
Stan: Kyle? What's happening?
Kyle: The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
Stan: What?! You can't let them do that!
Kyle: What am I supposed to do?
Cartman: Where are you going?!
Kyle: I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
Cartman: Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
Aslan: Then the day is lost.
Santa: What? What happened?
Luke Skywalker: You did it, kid!
Aslan: Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield!
Aslan: Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day!
Kyle: Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
Kyle: Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
Guard 2: You pot-smokin' hippies aren't gettin' through here, so back off!
Hippie 4: Stop that nuke!
Hippies: Stop that nuke!
Aslan: Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!
Perseus: Aslan! We're losing the battle!
Aslan: Cavity Creeps?
Wonder Woman: What can destroy the Cavity Creeps?
Perseus: Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control.
Robin Hood: Yes!
Gandalf: His powers are getting stronger. We might just have a chance here.
Stan: No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
Gandalf: Never mind! The battle is almost won! We can deal with him later.
Luke Skywalker: What?
Butters: Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?
Stan: So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
Aslan: We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!
Stan: The Chosen One?
Butters: Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.
General Deckter: All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books.
Tech 1: Sir, we have a security breach!
General Deckter: What?!
Tech 3: There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
General Deckter: What?
Cartman: You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
Lab Tech: Imaginary things are things made up by people, like Santa and Rudolph.
Tom: Yeah, and they detract from real things, like Jesus.
Tech 1: Maybe Jesus is imaginary too.
Tom: Ooooh, you'd better not say that! You'll go to hell!
Tech 7: It's possible that hell is also imaginary.
Lab Tech: What if heaven is imaginary? We'd be nuking heaven.
Tech 3: Yeah, but it wouldn't be real.
Lab Tech 2: So it'd be all right.
Cartman: Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
Tom: Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary, but Jesus and hell are real!
Tech 3: Well then, what about Buddha?
Lab Tech 3: Awww, see? Now you're being intolerant, Tom.
Tech 7: Am I real?
General Deckter: All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!
Kyle: Nothing.
Stan: What??
Stan: Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
Kyle: They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
Kyle: No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
Jesus: Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus.
Kyle: Oh boy...
Jesus: What seems to be the problem, my child?
Luke Skywalker: No eh, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker.
Luke Skywalker: Look, I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you remember when I brought down the Death Star. I m, I mean, that seemed impossible too, right?
Kyle: Yeah, I guess.
Superman: Kyle, this is Superman.
Kyle: Hi Superman.
Superman: I know that saving people can be a big responsibility, but no matter what it takes, it's worth it.
Superman: You can do this, Kyle. How hang on, because Hercules wants to talk to you.
Kyle: Oh God...
Superman: Yes, God is here too. He's gonna talk to you right after Captain Crunch.
Popeye: Gaw guguh, getskug off of me!
Computer: Missile launch in one minute.
Cartman: Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
General Deckter: Prepare for launch...
Tech 1: Sir, we have a security breach!
General Deckter: What?!
Tech 3: There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
Cartman: Kyle?
General Deckter: The hell are you doing back here?!
Kyle: Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
General Deckter: Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!
Kyle: You have to stop!
General Deckter: There's been an abort, Mr. Gore.
Lollipop King: That's it, Aslan! The evil characters have fled!
Jesus: He did it!
Fanciful Mayor: The evil characters! They're all behind the wall again.
Stan: Dude! How did you do that, Butters?
Butters: Well I just... used my imagination.
Kyle: Cartman, don't!
Stan: Dude.
Lollipop King: Oh my God.
Kyle: I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
Cartman: No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
General Deckter: That's true. You did.
Santa: Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.
Kyle: I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
Butters: Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
Steven: You WERE in Imaginationland, Butters! We've read all about it in the paper! The question is, what were you doing in Imaginationland when you were supposed to be helping your mother clean up the basement?!
Linda: You are grounded, mister!
Steven: Oh yes you are!
Sharon: Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.
Randy: They can play guitar now?
Sharon: No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.
Randy: Ohhh.
Sharon: If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.
Randy: Hey yeah...
Kyle: Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.
Butters: Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
Cartman: Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
Stan: Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.
Randy: But... But this is real.
Cartman: Real guitars are for old people.
Butters: They're gonna do it!
M.C: You have broken a hundred thousand points! You. Are. Rock stars!
Stan: Dude, we are total rock stars now!
Man: Stan Marsh?
Stan: Yeah?
Man: I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
Randy: No way!
Mr. Kincade: Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points.
Stan: That'd be awesome!
Mr. Kincade: Well, what do you think?
Producer: I like it. That's these boys playing?
Producer: Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?
Stan: Wow, this is a huge party.
Producer: Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.
Kyle: Oh my God!
Producer: Would you boys like to meet him?
Stan: Are you serious??
Producer: Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
Jay: Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys.
Guest: Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere?
Producer: You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
Producer: You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.
Tom Shane: That, would be impressive.
Stan: Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
M.C.: You Rock!
Kyle: D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
Stan: Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.
Stan: Really? That'd be sweet.
Stan: What, you mean, Kyle?
Mr. Kincade: Look, you score a lot higher than him; there's no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score.
Stan: But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
Thad: Yup.
Mr. Kincade: He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.
Stan: Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
Mr. Kincade: Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history.
Butters: Wow wee, look at him go!
Stan: ...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.
Stan: This is um, Thad Jarvis.
Thad: Sup?
Kyle: Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?
Stan: Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
Kyle: But it's our game. We bought it together.
Stan: I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
Kyle: Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
Stan: Don't put this all on me, Kyle!
Cartman: Oh my God this is so awesome.
Stan: You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
Stan: Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
Craig: Dude, this game rules.
Brett: Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it?
Stan: It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.
Brett: Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress.
Stan: Hero-Heroin Hero?
Stan: And there's no score? No crowds?
The Dragon: Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on.
Producer: How are they coming?
Mr. Kincade: No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days
Stan: Ugh. Damint.
Thad: Dude, sup. Did you practice last night?
Mr. Kincade: Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play.
Stan: Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
Thad: No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.
Mr. Kincade: Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?
Stan: We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
Stan: You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
Mr. Kincade: Stan, what is the matter with you?
Mr. Kincade: What is this?
Stan: Man...
Mr. Kincade: Are you playing Heroin Hero?
Stan: Just, just a little.
Stan: I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!
Mr. Kincade: You'd better pull your act together, because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!
Stan: No problem.
Older Boy: Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!
Kyle: I'm not done yet.
Younger Boy: Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system?
Kyle: No. You're thinking of somebody else.
Younger Boy: Yeah, sure. He's the kid that scored a hundred thousand points.
Older Boy: How come you're playing here now?
Mick: You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this.
Kyle: Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
Mick: Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little and... maybe you can play it for free.
Kyle: I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
Mick: Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all.
Kyle: Thanks, Mick.
Stan: Huh? What, uh?
Mr. Kincade: You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!
Stan: The dragon. Where did it go?
Token: Go Stan!
Cartman: All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
Token: Yeah, Stan!
Craig: Dude, what's the matter with him?
Craig: Oh man, I can't watch this.
Brett: There he is! So, did you break a million yet?
Stan: No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
Brett: Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top.
Stan: I just wanna find something else to play.
Stan: I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?
Stan: Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
Stan: Please, it- it won't take long.
Stan: Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
Kyle: It was pretty fun, wasn't it?
Kyle: Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
Stan: I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
Stan: What, you mean it?
Kyle: I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
Mick: Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?
Randy: Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh.
The Dragon: Come on, come on. You almost got me. Catch me. Come on.
Stan: Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!
Randy: Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.
Stan: No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
Randy: NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
Stan: Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
Cartman: 'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
Butters: Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!
Cartman: What?
The Boys: Oh, let's go! Cone on, let's go!
Craig: They did it!
Jimmy: Oh my sweet J-Jesus!
Stan: That's it?
Stan: Dude, Butters, calm down.
Craig: So who do they say is the cutest?
Butters: I dunno.
Token: Who do they say is the ugliest?
Stan: Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
Clyde: If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.
Kyle: You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
Craig: You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
Cartman: Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
Craig: You don't think they put the fat tub of lard at the bottom?
Cartman: No, because chicks know I'm not fat, I'm buff! They probably put you at the bottom of the list 'cause you have fucked-up teeth! Or Kenny 'cause he's poor.
Kenny: (They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)
Cartman: Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
Butters: You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
Cartman: All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
Cartman: You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
Bebe: That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
Cartman: Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him?
Cartman: Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can out think them.
Cartman: Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
Cartman: Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
Cartman: Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time". When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
Butters: You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
Clyde: All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!
A Boy: Hurry hurry!
Craig: Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I?
Clyde: What number am I on?
A Boy: Is it set up?
Stan: It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
Stan: And then Token, and then me.
Token: I'm number two? Wow.
Kyle: No way.
Stan: Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.
Kyle: I'm last? Last?
Stan: Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?
Kyle: I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
Butters: Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
Linda: Way to go, champ.
Stephen: Well, guess we don't have to ground him.
Sheila: Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.
Kyle: The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
Sheila: What? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
Kyle: Look, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I-I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
Kyle: Oh God! I do?
Gerald: But he has his mother's nose.
Sheila: Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.
Clyde: Hey, what's goin' on?
Two Girls: Hey Clyde.
Clyde: Hey.
Anne: Hi Clyde.
Girl: Oh, not much, just hanging around-
Blonde Boy: Hey.
Big-Eared Boy: I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry.
Kyle: Yeah.
Big-Eared Boy: Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground!
Fat Girl: We're not?
Kyle: No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
Bushy Eyebrows Boy: Hey yeah.
Stan: Uh, Wendy. Could I talk to you?
Wendy: This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.
Stan: Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
Wendy: Which one? We make lists all the time.
Stan: The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
Wendy: Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's not just something we do flippantly! There's protocol!
Stan: Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
Bebe: Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.
Red: If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?
Bebe: Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
Girls: Sunshine.
Lola: Deliberating "Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse"? Millie has the floor.
Blond Girl: I don't think anyone here disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Teresa's, but it doesn't make it the cutest.
Bebe: The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.
Lola: Sunshine sparkle. Wendy has the floor.
Heidi: Is she crazy?
Wendy: Go ahead.
Stan: Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
Red: You thought you should be number one?
Stan: NO.
Bebe: Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!
Wendy: He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
Bebe: I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
Girls: Sunshine.
Kyle: Who said that?
Kyle: Abraham Lincoln?
Clyde: Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.
Abraham Lincoln: Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed.
Kyle: But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
Abraham Lincoln: You must be patient.
Kyle: Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
Abraham Lincoln: Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you.
Kyle: I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
Stan: I have no idea what you're talking about.
Red: Oh, hey Wendy.
Wendy: Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?
Wendy: I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-
Stan: That didn't sparkle with her, did it?
Jerry: Do you like to put this on your True-Value card today?
Wendy: Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.
Lola: Why would she do that?
Wendy: Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.
Lola: Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's father owns the shoe store at the mall? A lot of us have always wanted to date Clyde to get free shoes, but we couldn't, because he wasn't popular enough.
Wendy: So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!
Jenny: Bebe?! Who do you think authorized the buyout?!
Jenny: She's dating Clyde now. Nobody loves shoes more than her.
Stan: What's going on?
Wendy: When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-
Jenny: Do you really think they'll believe you over the heads of the committee?! We'll simply generate a new list! "Biggest Liars"! And put you at the top!
Lola: Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go! And keep your little mouth shut!
Wendy: What?
Yamal: He said he gonna burn the school down to the ground.
Kyle: Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
Stan: The list was a forgery, Kyle!
Kyle: Huh??
Cartman: AHHHHHH.
Dentist: Well, there's no doubt about it. Those tonsils need to come out.
Cartman: What?
Liane: Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?
Dentist: It's a very simple operation. We'll just put you to sleep, Eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free!
Cartman: No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
Cartman: No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
Dentist: Well then I guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either.
Cartman: ...Ice cream?
Dentist: It'd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who aren't scared of hospitals.
Liane: What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?
Liane: Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey.
Liane: That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!
Liane: I'm so proud of you, Eric.
Cartman: All right, so where's my ice cream?
Liane: Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor.
Cartman: You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
Doctor: No, it's not. Eric, I'm afraid that we've accidentally infected you with the AIDS virus.
Liane: ...What!?
Cartman: What's that supposed to mean?!
Doctor: During the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. A mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with HIV. It was a one in a billion fluke.
Cartman: I HAVE AIDS?
Doctor: Not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes AIDS. We are very sorry.
Liane: Oh, my poor little baby!
Cartman: Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
Cartman: No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
Principal Victoria: Boys, please take a seat.
Principal Victoria: Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV.
Butters: Oh no.
Doctor 2: He's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion. The disease is in very early stages and completely manageable, but he's naturally a bit scared.
Kyle: Cartman has HIV?
Doctor 2: We need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from Eric. You can still give him hugs and even kisses. Don't be afraid of him, just-
Kyle: Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
Principal Victoria: All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?
Kyle: ...No. Way.
Cartman: God damn it, this sucks ass!
Butters: Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
Cartman: Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
Doctor 2: No, you're not going to die, Eric. AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment and-
Cartman: Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
Liane: Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?
Waitress: This is everyone. We didn't sell that many tickets.
Butters: Great benefit, Eric!
Jimmy: The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.
Cartman: So this is it?
Cartman: Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
M.C.: With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman.
Cartman: Just bring out Elton John already!
M.C.: Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit.
Waitress: It's all right, we got somebody better: Jimmy Buffett!
Cartman: Jimmy Buffett?!
Cartman: Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
Liane: Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.
Cartman: Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!
Cartman: Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.
Stan: Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.
Cartman: Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
Stan: Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
Cartman: No you don't!
Stan: He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
Cartman: Ironic how?
Stan: Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
Butters: Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.
Butters: Okay, but... what are you going to do?
Cartman: Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
Butters: I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
Cartman: Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
Butters: I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
Cartman: I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
Butters: Wow, you really know what you're doing.
Kyle: Wagh.
Dr. Doctor: No, it isn't strep...
Sheila: Oh, well there's a relief.
Dr. Doctor: ...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?
Sheila: No, why?
Kyle: What? No?!
Sheila: Doctor, what are you saying?
Kyle: What?
Sheila: HIV?
Dr. Doctor: It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt.
Sheila: No, that's impossible!
Sheila: Kyle? Kyle!
Kyle: I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
Cartman: Kyle, what?!
Kyle: Why do I have HIV?!
Clyde: ...Oh...
Cartman: Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
Kyle: What did you do?!
Cartman: Nothing!
Kyle: Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
Cartman: Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
Cartman: Kyle!
Principal Victoria: All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?
Principal Victoria: What?
Kyle: He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
Principal Victoria: Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?
Cartman: Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
Mr. Mackey: Eric, that is not appropriate behavior, m'kay? You cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease!
Principal Victoria: That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.
Kyle: An apology?!
Principal Victoria: You're sorry for what, Eric?
Cartman: I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
Principal Victoria: That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.
Mr. Mackey: Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?
Kyle: A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
Kyle: There is no cure, you asshole!
Cartman: No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
Kyle: What hope?!
Cartman: Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
Kyle: You're lying!
Cartman: NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
Kyle: Magic Johnson?
Cartman: He was a basketball player.
Kyle: So what?!
Cartman: We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
Clerk: Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each.
Cartman: Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
Clerk: ...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.
Cartman: Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
Kyle: Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
Kyle: NO!
Clerk: Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
Cartman: We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
Clerk: Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?
Flight Attendant: We're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. What kind of cancer did you say you have again?
Cartman: Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
Flight Attendant: I'm so sorry
Flight Attendant: Hm, I don't know. These days I think I'd rather have AIDS than cancer.
Magic: You boys both have the virus? Are you sure?
Cartman: We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
Cartman: Kyle, we need to try to find a-
Kyle: WHAT PART OF BEING INFECTED WITH A DEADLY DISEASE DO YOU FIND FUNNY?!
Kyle: KNOCK IT OFF RIGHT NOW! THIS ISN'T FUNNY! AT ALL!
Kyle: Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
Magic: Well, not at all.
Kyle: But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
Magic: Sure.
Kyle: Dude.
Magic: Oh, oh yeah, I- I don't trust banks. I sleep with all my money.
Kyle: You sleep with money. Every night?
Magic: Yeah, I like to keep it close b- ...You don't think that..?
Scientist 1: The cash does seem to retrain the HIV cells from stabilizing.
Scientist 2: Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it.
Kyle: Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
Mitch: Then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether.
Magic: I have enough cash for all three of us! We should give it a try!
Scientist 2: Na-noo, it's ridiculous. We need FDA approval, control studies! I'm sorry, but this is impossible!
Scientist 2: I suppose we could try to distill Magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it's very risky.
Cartman: Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
Cartman: All right!
Scientist 3: What is it?
Driver: Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!
Kyle: Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
Announcer: Live, from Chicago, Illinois, it's Decision 2008.
Stan: Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
Cartman: Yeah, but we totally don't.
Moderator: And so, Mr. Obama, why don't you tell us your stance on military spending?
Barack Obama: Well, my opinion is that-
Anchorman: Britney Spears has been spotted camping in the Colorado mountains, and one report claims that she has taken a piss... in the forest. Robert Pooner has more.
Cartman: Aw dude, that's our town!
Randy: She's such a train wreck!
Butters: Aw, poor girl.
Kyle: A hundred thousand dollars?
Cartman: That's enough to buy slaves!
Ron: Britney is said to be now hiding out in a South Park motel. Aand now back to the stupid Democratic debates.
Hillary Clinton: ...and spearchuckers.
Kyle: It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
Kyle: A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
Stan: Oh no.
Kyle: Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
Photographer 1: Join the club.
Photographer 2: Yeah, all you amateur photographers are makin' this tougher on the professionals!
Guard: Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs.
Stan: Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
Guard: You are?
Guard: Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are here and they've brought you a squirrel.
Kyle: We did it guys!
Stan: I told you that would work!
The Boys: Yehehahah, all right!
Kyle: Ahall right!
Kyle: All right. Butters, go get next to her.
Butters: I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
Stan: Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
Kyle: All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
Stan: Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
Britney: I've got a better idea.
Stan: You do?
Guard: Hey, everything all right u-. Oh.
Stan: We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
Kyle: How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
Kyle: Whew.
Stan: Oh, thank God.
Doctor: But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone?
Kyle: Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
Doctor: I don't want you making her upset.
Stan: We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
Kyle: Oh my God!
Stan: Oh no!
Kyle: Oh, God, what have we done?!
Announcer: It's Britney Watch! Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
Chris: No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out.
Doctor: Damn it, she can't handle any stress right now!
Britney: Guglo.
Manager: Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.
Doctor: Damn it you have to take her out of here; she can't be around all this right now.
Britney: Right. We need to take her home. Boys, can you give me a hand with her?
Photographer 3: Hey look!
Stan: Jesus Christ!
Stan: Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
Manager: That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away.
Kyle: What?!
Manager: All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it.
Kyle: Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
Female Aide: God, what a train wreck.
Stan: Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.
Britney: Gogehah.
Manager: E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.
Britney: Egeul-gageol
Sound Engineer: Gah, she's so stupid.
Stan: What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
Stan: No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!
Britney: Okel?
Announcer: Live, from Las Vegas, it's the MTV Video Music Awards
Singers: The way she fee-els. [Britney leans over, and another dancer stands her up again. She warbles some more] Love inside.
Man: Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing.
Singers: Temporary. [Britney warbles some more. Two male dancers come by and turn her around so the camera can focus on her ass] So hot! [a few moments she gets a solo segment and four male dancers fawn over her]
Reporter: Disaster at the MTV awards. People are ridiculing Britney Spears. Her performance was awful, Tom. She looked tired, she looked fat, she didn't have a head. It was just completely phoned in. No doubt, Tom, that girl has major issues.
Stan: We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
Kyle: Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
Ron: Oooooh, ouch!
Anchorwoman: Oh boy, now, Leslie, this seems like a really bad camel toe offense.
Robert Pooner: She was sportin' toe like never before, Brian. I, I don't know what's wrong with that girl, but, it's a slap in the face to camels all over the planet.
Ron: Those close to Britney say they are very worried and want to bring her home safe. And now back to the local news.
Ron: Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts.
Kyle: Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
Stan: Dude, they're never gonna let us through.
Kyle: Yes they are! I have an idea.
Paparazzo 2: Britney? Where'd she go?
Reporter: Hey, wait a minute. Where's her camel toe?!
Paparazzo 5: Ooo, psych!
Paparazzo 7: What do you think all this effort has been for?
Officer: She must... die.
Background Singers: Hetus. Alte omnebus. [the photographers begins to join in] Virtu e poquebus. [other adults join in this nonsensical Latin chant]
Narrator: Little Stanley was tired and hungry. But he knew that for Britney Spears to be safe, he had to get her to the North Pole.
Elderly Man: Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town.
Kyle: What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
Bob Summers: Well nobody wants her to die, little boy. We all simply... need her to. Do you understand?
Kyle: NO!
Paparazzo 8: Look, kid, throughout history people have found it necessary to engage in... human sacrifice.
Bob Summers: In ancient times, humans would commonly pick one lovely girl, adorn her with jewels, treat her like a goddess, and then... watch her die.
Paparazzo 9: We like to think we're more civilized now, but the truth is our lust for torture and death is no different than it was in gladidator times.
Paparazzo 10: Only difference is that now we like to watch people put to death through magazines and photographs.
Canadian Paparazzo: It's a damn shame too. Old ways were bettah. Used to be we just picked someone by lottery and then stoned them to death.
Woman: Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
Kyle: You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
Man: Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest.
Paparazzo 11: All right, everyone's about here.
Stan: Oh no!
Britney: Ohhh thoooo!
Gerald: It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.
Kyle: Be a good boy? You know all about this?
Stan: Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
Kyle: She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
Randy: For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.
Canadian Paparazzo: Sacrifice in March, corn have plenty starch.
Kyle: Corn harvest!
Randy: We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.
Stan: All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
Manager: The kid is right. This has gone on too long.
Paparazzo 12: Yeah. She was supposed to have killed herself a long time ago.
Farmer: And harvest is coming soon.
Woman 2: Come on, hurry up.
Doctor: She's dead.
Gil: Mornin' Bill.
Bill: Mornin' Gil.
Randy: An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it "The Choking Game", hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?
Mr. Mackey: Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?
Butters: Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
Stan: That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?
Kyle: You guys are wasting your time.
Stan: Yeah, this is not gonna work.
Cartman: Okay, ready Kenny?
Kenny: (All set.)
Kenny: (Woah.)
Stan: Do you feel anything?
Kenny: (Hey cool! Check it out!)
Father: I see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits.
Kenny: (Yeahhh!)
Father: Then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of Varnov. Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.
Cartman: Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
Kenny: (You fucking asshole!)
Cartman: Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
Kyle: Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!
Stan: What titties?
Kyle: Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
Stan: Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
Kenny: (I almost... touched them.)
Kyle: Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
Gerald: Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
Mr. Mackey: Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day.
Cartman: Oh God, I'm bored already.
Stephen Abootman: That's right: spirit! What is it that makes Canada so important?
Lumberjack: It's like the world doesn't respect Canada at all, eh?
Stephen Abootman: That's right! And I think it's time for Canada to show the world just how bad things would be without it! Together we can send a message! It's time for Canada ...to strike!
Woman 1: Did you say strike?
Stephen Abootman: Yes! Every Canadian join me! Join together!
Man 2: Canada, on strike.
Man 3: Canada, on strike.
Swiss Delegate: Ahhh, when you say "Canada is on strike", what exactly do you mean?
French Delegate: Who exactly are you to authorize this strike?
Stephen Abootman: I'm Stephen Abootman! Leader of the WGA!
French Delegate: The WGA?
French Delegate: What exactly does Canada want?
Stephen Abootman: We want: more... money!
Japanese Delegate: More money from where?
Stephen Abootman: Just more money! You know! Canada doesn't get enough money! Other countries have lots of money; we want, we want some of that money! Hu- how about- the Internet? The Internet makes lots of money! So give us some of that money!
Aide 1: Yeah! Give us Internet money!
British Delegate: A Mister A- Abootman, you seem to- not understand how ...global economics works. I think that-
British Delegate: I'm afraid we can't.
Husband: That's right; we're a very progressive couple.
Kyle: Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.
Cartman: We don't care. *urp*
Kyle: You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
Stan: Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!
Butters: Yippie!
Butters: Aww, this one again?!
Stan: God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!
Terrance: Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.
Phillip: Oh? Does it run on electricity?
Phillip: Not as fat as your face!
Butters: Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
Cartman: God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
Kyle: There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
Peter Griffin: You think that's bad? Remember the time I sang "La Cucaracha" for Paul McCartney?
Canadians: We want more! We want more!
Terrance: Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.
Stephen Abootman: Go home?! You can't leave the picket line!
Terrance: But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.
Stephen Abootman: Look, guy, we are to stay strong! If you don't stand with your fellow Canadians, then you are a rat!
Terrance: Don't call me a rat, buddih!
Stephen Abootman: I'm not your buddih, friend!
Phillip: He's not your friend, guy!
Stephen Abootman: I'm not your guy, buddih!
Terrance: He's not your buddih, friend!
Kyle: We totally think you should have more money.
Kyle: Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
Stephen Abootman: Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?!
Kyle: The Internet?
Stan: What'd they say?
Kyle: They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
Cartman: How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
Butters: Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
Kyle: We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
A Nun: Oh my.
Cartman: There's more people viewing it!
Stan: This is going great!
Tom: And in other world news, the leader of Japan today is calling for an increase in military spending.
Aide 1: How come they never mention anything about us?! When are they gonna get to the strike?!
Stephen Abootman: Don't worry, the strike is big news. I'm sure it will be one of the top stories.
Tom: In other news tonight, it the Internet video that has already seen over ten million views. A young confused-looking boy dancing and singing a song called "What What (In My Asshole)".
Stephen Abootman: Aw damn it that's not news! What about us?!
Phillip: Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?
Stephen Abootman: We'll win! We'll just have to stay resilient!
Phillip: Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.
Terrance: Yeah, let's give it up, guy.
Stephen Abootman: Don't call me your guy! I'm not your guy, friend!
Terrance: Well I'm not your friend, buddih!
Stephen Abootman: Well I'm not your buddih, guy!
Woman 2: Wait! Here it is! Turn it up! We're on!
Stephen Abootman: All right! Shh! I told you, I told you, listen, listensh, listen listen listen.
Tom: In a shocking turn of events, it now appears that thousands of people from Denmark are flooding into the United States with hopes of taking the place of the striking Canadians.
Stephen Abootman: What?
Female Reporter: Do you really think you Danish can replace the Canadians?
Danish Man: Well, where we come from it's pretty cold too, ja. We like hockey and nobody really pays any attention to us.
Danish Woman: Nobody knows where Denmark is.
Danish Man: Right. So when you think about it, we're the Canadians of Europe.
Stan: Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
Clerk: Take a number and wait with everyone else.
Cartman: Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
Tron Guy: Hey, I know you. You're the "What What (In My Asshole)" kid.
Stan: It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
Cartman: Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
Butters: Uhhh a few hundred thousand?
Chocolate Rain Guy: Huh, mere peanuts. Chocolate Rain has done gangbusters. Theoretically, I'm a millionaire.
Cartman: Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
Kyle: Wait we're working on it.
Kyle: Sir, we're doing everything we can.
Kyle: We don't want you to die.
Chocolate Rain Guy: I don't think so. Nothing takes priority over Chocolate Rain.
Star Wars Kid: Oh, here he goes with the ego again. Who crowned you the top Internet star?!
Chocolate Rain Guy: I did. When I became bigger than all you bitches.
Chocolate Rain Guy: You'd better shut your fuckin' mouth, Laughin' Baby!
Afro Ninja: Did you all forget about Afro Ninja? My Internet thing was bigger than anybody's. I made over a hundred million theoretical dollars.
Star Wars Kid: Well Sneezing Panda is theoretically worth billions!
Numa Numa Guy: Haw!
Kyle: Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.
Tron Guy: Hai Hayaaa!
Butters: Are we gonna get tested on this?
Principal Victoria: Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.
Cartman: Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
Principal Victoria: Any other volunteers, perhaps?
Principal Victoria: All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.
Kyle: You're not the teacher, fatass.
News Anchor: But the scientists say the process could help thousands of people who've become disfigured and need ears or noses.
Mrs. Garrison: Holy Freaking Jesus.
Mrs. Garrison: Doctor, what about a penis?
Researcher 1: Well, a penis is something a man puts into a woman's vagina.
Mrs. Garrison: No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA, could you grow a penis on a mouse for me?
Researcher 1: You don't understand: doing this stuff is very expensive. And we've never tried a penis before; there's no guarantee it would work.
Principal Victoria: Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.
Cartman: Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
Mr. Mackey: Uh, "commend" means you've done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay?
Principal Victoria: These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.
Cartman: That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
Cartman: Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
Kyle: You're not an awesome teacher!
Cartman: Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
Kyle: The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
Cartman: Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
Kyle: Kenny's!
Cartman: Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
Cartman: Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
Class: Ohhhhhhhhhhh.
Mrs. Miller: This may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez
Teen Boy 2: What the hell is thiiis?
Cartman: I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
Researcher 1: Iii think you're going to be very pleased with the progress, Ms. Garrison.
Mrs. Garrison: Wow! My penis looks great!
Researcher 1: Yes. It's a fantastic penis. Congratulations.
Mrs. Garrison: How long before it's ready?
Researcher 1: Welll, it still has some forming to do, but fairly soon.
Mrs. Garrison: Whoa no!
Cartman: Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
Teen Boy 3: Hey man, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Teen Boy 4: Yeahhhh.
Cartman: Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
Teen Girl 1: Hey, I don't wanna be called a cheater!
Cartman: No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
Teen Boy 6: This is bullshit. I don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat.
Kyle: What?
Teen Boy 6: Hey, I walked out of your class, teacher. Look, I don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating.
Teen Boy 7: Sure thing, Mr. C.
Cartman: Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
Teen Boy 6: You cheated!
Teen Boy 6: Fuck you, man, you can't do that!
Linda: A penis is loose in our kitchen!
Stephen: A penis?
Linda: Yes! It just ran across the floor!
Stephen: Now darling, calm down.
Linda: Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!
Linda: There! There, you see it?
Stephen: Oh, it's just a little penis, darling.
Butters: Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!
Stephen: Your teacher's penis?
Stephen: Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?
Teen Boy 6: I thought that... well maybe I can give cheating a try.
Class: "I mis-interpreted the rules."
Cartman: Good. Again.
Class: "I mis-interpreted the rules."
Cartman: Again!
Class: "I mis-interpreted the rules."
Cartman: Now you sound like white people!
Mrs. Garrison: What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside?! Why didn't you call me?!
Stephen: Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out.
Mrs. Garrison: Well now how am I supposed to find it?! It could be anywhere!
Woman: Eeeek! Eeeeeek!
Husband: Carole, get down from there!
Woman: Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!
Husband: I'm sure that penis is way more scared of you than you are of it.
Cartman: The answer to #27 is 5.
Cartman: The answer to #28 is 14.
Class: "The answer to #28 is 14."
Melita: There isn't any point to all this. I won't be going to college. I'm pregnant, all right? I just found out, and Eduardo isn't going to help me raise it.
Melita: No. I'm Catholic. I think abortion is wrong.
Cartman: Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
Melita: That cheating is good?
Melita: I don't know, Mr. C.
Mrs. Garrison: That's right.
Officer Harris: Long whiskers or short?
Mrs. Garrison: Short, and little fluffy ears.
Officer Harris: Fluffy ears, okay.
Mrs. Garrison: Think you got it, Mitch?
Officer: Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner.
Sgt. Yates: What is it?
Officer: Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese.
Woman 2: A penis!
Penis: Someone somewhere is feelin' my despair
Mouse: Feelin' my despair
Penis: And this same moon is
Penis, Mouse: [together] making them think of that-.
Mitch Harris: There's not a chance now.
Cartman: Uh what?
Teen Boy 8: Monitor us in a private room?
Teen Boy 3: Now they're gonna know we've been cheating all along.
Teen Boy 2: I knew it man! You made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing!
Cartman: Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
Teen Girl 1: Yeah, come on, we can do this, guys.
Cartman: You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
Teen Boy 6: Uh, can we say something?
A Teacher: Whoa uh wait, uh, hang on a second. My wife had ovarian cancer, so she can't have babies.
Stan: Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
Sharon: Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!
Sharon: Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime.
Shelly: Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!
Shelly: Why do you hate me?!
Randy: Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone.
Sharon: No, mister, it's time for night-night.
Randy: But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-
Stan: What the hell?
Stan: What?
Randy: My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?
Stan: My Internet's not working either.
Shelly: I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
Gerald: Randy. What happened?
Randy: Our house... It has no Internet.
Gerald: Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
Kyle: Ih it's not working.
Kyle: I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
Gerald: But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
Randy: Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!
Kyle: I have to get online before school.
Stan: What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.
Randy: Right, Starbucks!
Gerald: Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
Stephen: Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?
Randy: No! Nobody's is!
Randy: Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
Clerk: Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya.
Kyle: It's not working here?
Randy: Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.
Man 2: No, don't. You're wasting your time.
Randy: How do you know?!
Man 2: Because we just came from there! There was nothing! Not one scrap of Internet!
Gerald: How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
Stephen: Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report.
Gerald: We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
Man 3: What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?
Anchorman: Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news. It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4. We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back.
Randy: Jesus, it's statewide.
Gerald: It could be nationwide.
Gerald: No Internet... anywhere...
Sharon: What's the matter?
Stan: Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
Randy: You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
Gerald: Randy, where will you go?
Randy: We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
Gerald: You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
Randy: Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!
Stephen: It could come back.
Stephen: Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?
Randy: Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
Transient Man 1: Where are you from, old-timer?
Old-Timer: Kansas City. Had me a store there. Kind of... computer supply store. When the Internet went, the stores went too.
Transient Man 2: Things will be different when we get out to Californee. Soon as we get us some Internet we can all rest easy.
Transient Man 3: Why sure, Silicon Valley. They gots a whole mess of Internet up there. 'Say a man can practically roll around in it.
Transient Man 4: When I get to that Internet I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight. 'Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it.
Transient Man 1: Well I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just stahrt e-mailin'. Just keep on e-mailin' till my fingers are sore to the bone.
Transient Man 5: You folks all headin' to Silicon Valley?
Randy: That's right. We need to get online.
Transient Man 5: Haha. "Get online" he says.
Shelly: Amiiir... I miss you so much...
Worker: Name?
Randy: Do they have Internet here?
Worker: Name?
Randy: Marsh.
Worker: Service provider?
Randy: NetZero.
Randy: So is there Internet here?
Randy: Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.
Stan: All right!
Refugee Man 3: Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name. Each family gets 40 seconds o' Internet per day.
Randy: Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
Volunteer 1: Well it's all we got, so we gotta make do.
Refugee Man 4: Look, honey, we ordered us some books on Amazon.
Volunteer 2: All right, time's up.
Volunteer 2: Next? Brady, John H.
Randy: Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.
Anchorman: Oh yeah, a fax!!
Anchorman 2: Oh a fax!
Anchorman: It's a fax, it's a fax! It's a fax, it's a fax!
Anchorman: Oh! it says, "The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it."
General: Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working.
Scientist 1: We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly.
General: Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!
General: What's wrong with it?
Scientist 2: See that flashing orange light in the middle? It's supposed to be solid green.
Volunteer 2: All right, time's up.
Volunteer 2: Next? Nelson, Peter T.
Volunteer 3: Look, we're just tryin' to get by here. Everyone's gotta take what they can get.
Volunteer 3: So jack off.
Volunteer 3: What do you want us to do? Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?!
Randy: Three minutes would be plenty.
Shelly: What number are you, turd?
Stan: Eight fifty one.
Stan: Hey! Mom!
Randy: Yeah, how'd you know?
Refugee Man 5: Lots of us fellas came here for that reason. We all got used to seein' lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy.
Randy: I know, right?
Refugee Man 5: Anyway, we got us a simulator. You just call out what you wanna see and then say "click".
Refugee Man 5: Well, sorry. And that'll be $49 on your credit card.
Anchorman: We, we now have a reporter on the scene. Uhl-let's go live!
Field Reporter: Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again.
Kyle: I think... I know what's wrong.
Shelly: This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!
Stan: It's gotta be our turn soon.
Volunteer 2: All right, folks, it's bed time. No more Internet for today.
Woman: A little closer!
Refugee Man 2: What is that?
Refugee Man 4: Sounds like someone's bein' attacked by a tiger.
Randy: Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Stan: Dad?
Sharon: Randy!
Volunteer 2: You son of a bitch!
Scientist 1: All clear for procedure.
Scientist 2: Look! The flashing yellow light is steady green now!
Scientist 1: He did it!
Scientist 3: I've got Internet!
Scientist 4: Me too!
Transient Man 5: I've got Internet.
Transient Man 6: Me too!
Shelly: What?
Amir: It's me. Amir.
Shelly: O... kay.
Amir: Your family came here too, huh?
Amir: So uhhh, I guess I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back home.
Shelly: Yeah, okay. Sounds good.
Pioneer Paul: Hi, kids, and welcome to my village. I settled here in 1864 with my mahr and pahr. Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange clothes like you all are wearin'. And what's that fancy yellow horse carriage you got out there?
Stan: Ughh.
Kyle: This is gonna suck.
Cartman: Let's be partners, Kenny.
Stan: Naw, I'm with Wendy.
Mr. Garrison: Eric, partner with Butters.
Cartman: God damn it!
Cartman: That isn't necessary!
Mr. Garrison: Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!
Cartman: You can let go now, Butters.
Cartman: Butters, come on!
Stan: Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
Wendy: Thanks, Stan.
Pioneer Paul: Damn it Chad!
Gunsmith: Why howdy, partners, I'm the town gunsmith. You see, in our time it's pretty violent. See them holes in the walls? That's so we can put rifles through to protect us from Injuns.
Cartman: I wanna shoot an Indian.
Butters: Do you see any Indians?
Cartman: Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
Butters: Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
Cartman: Fine, then let go of my hand!
Butters: Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
Cartman: Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
Butters: I'm not lettin' go!
Cartman: Fine, then you're comin' with me!
Cartman: Butters, let go God-damn it!
Pioneer Paul: This here is our general store. It's where I buy all my supplies an' sich.
Clerk: Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.
Wendy: Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then.
Clerk: What do you mean "back then"? Don't forget, it's 1864.
Kyle: Right. Except for it really isn't.
Kyle: What's that?
Stan: Sounds like police sirens.
Leader: We lost them, we lost them!
Injured Man: Damn pig cops!
Wendy: What's going on?
Leader: Everyone down on the ground NOW!
Pioneer Paul: A phone? Why, what's a phone? We ain't never hearda sich a thing.
Stan: What?!
Kyle: Come on, this is serious!
Pioneer Paul: Eh storehand, you ever heard of this fancy shmancy phone?
Clerk: Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time.
Stan: Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!
Pioneer Paul: If you mean the law, only law around here is town sheriff McLawdog. You see, 1864 is a time of growth and development in the Old West.
Cashier: Aww, aren't you two cute holdin' hands. Are you special little buddies?
Cartman: Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
Butters: We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
Wendy: Over here. This looks like an office.
Pioneer Paul: Well, what a straaange contraption.
Kyle: What's the number to dial out?
Pioneer Paul: Dial out? Partner, them are some funny words you're usin'.
Clerk: Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-
Clerk: Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time.
Pioneer Paul: I'll say.
Kyle: I got through. Hello, police?
911 Operator: Nine one one, what's your emergency?
Kyle: There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
911 Operator: Taken hostage where?
Kyle: The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
911 Operator: You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?
Cartman: Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
Cartman: Yeheah, we're wired up!
Butters: Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
Cartman: Aw, just a few more things.
Butters: No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
Blond: How did they find us?!
Police Chief: All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage.
Blond: How did they find us?!
Police Chief: All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage.
Lieutenant: Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter!
Police Chief: Everyone stay on your toes! These are professionals we're dealing with here!
Officer 1: What did they rob, sir?
Police Chief: A Burger King.
Balding Man: No. Don't forget we've got these too.
Kyle: Why aren't the cops coming in?
Wendy: They must be negotiating.
Pioneer Paul: Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots.
Stan: Wait, you have guns here?
Pioneer Paul: Sure. Sheriff got lots of rifles in his office.
Stan: Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
Pioneer Paul: All righty. Come on, storehand.
Cartman: Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
Butters: We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
Cartman: Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
Butters: Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.
Butters: What?! They called the cops?!
Cartman: They must have realized we left. Damn.
Butters: Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
Cartman: Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
Butters: You just got me busted forever!
Cartman: Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
Cartman: All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
Butters: No.
Cartman: Butters?
Butters: Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
Leader: Keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts. Everyone check in at two-minute intervals. I hope you have good news, Ohrlich.
Ohrlich: The police have us completely surrounded on all sides. There's no way we're gettin' out above ground without being spotted.
Leader: Above ground?
Leader: So if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police. Excellent.
Ohrlich: One more thing, Frans: I want my share of the take now.
Ohrlich: I was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel. Then you take the loot to Berlin and I never see you again. I want my cut.
Frans: I'm going to ask you again, what is the door code to the tunnel?!
Smithy: I...
Frans: Yes?
Worker: No. Please. Don't hurt me.
Frans: Give us the code to that door and we can leave!
Frans: God damn it you people are fucking insane!
Kyle: I don't believe it.
Officer 2: Sector Bravo, no activity.
Butters: Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
Butters: That looks dangerous.
Butters: Oh gosh in heaven.
Butters: Whoa!
Cartman: Save me!
Cartman: ... Oh dude, laaame.
Frans: Frohlich, check in. Have you found any other employees?
Walsky: We found this guy in the jail of the sheriff's office.
Murderin' Murphy: Y'are all gettin' it for puttin' me in that thar jail!
Woman: Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.
Pioneer Paul: You're just gonna have to kill us, mister, 'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all.
Kenny: (What? Hey, let go.)
Kenny: (No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
Butters: I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
Cartman: Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
Butters: Let's do it!
Woman: I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.
Frans: God damn it!
Kyle: Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!
Kyle: Stan?
Kenny: (God damn it, someone help me!)
Frans: Wha-what are you doing?
stan: I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
Pioneer Paul: That's right, Murderin' Murphy. He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa.
Murderin' Murphy: They killed my pahr!
Stan: I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
Pioneer Paul: Y-y-yeah, I understand that.
Clerk: Finally, a fella that talks some sense.
Stan: If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
Pioneer Paul: Oh, well uh, I reckon the easiest number to remember for any big safe door lock would be... 1864.
Clerk: Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.
Mr. Garrison: No, you got your door code, let us go!
Butters: Yeah, it sure has.
Cartman: Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
Butters: Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
Cartman: Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
Butters: Been a hoot all right!
Walsky: Get your hands behind your head!
Cartman: What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
Butters: Huh uh.
Walsky: Do what I tell you!
Butters: Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
Walsky: Let go or else I'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go!
Cartman: Butters.
Walsky: Now!
Butters: AAAAH!
Stan: Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
Murderin' Murphy: Yeah.
Stan: He done killed yer pahr.
Mr. Garrison: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Officer 3: Whoa, no, no!
Officer 2: Hostages are secure at the park entrance!
Murderin' Murphy: I got you now, Pioneer Paul!
Woman: Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!
Pioneer Paul: We made it!
Woman 2: Oh God, I can't wait to get out of this dress.
Pioneer Paul: Uh, listen, if anyone still wants to know, the phone is in the administration building, you dial 9 to get out, and there's actually a back exit behind the horse troughs. Good night everybody, thanks for coming. We did it, guys!
Gunsmith: Let's go to TGI Fridays and get some jalapeo poppers!
Murderin' Murphy: Yeah, that'd be great!
Man 1: All right!
Man 2: Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeo poppers.
Man 3: Let's go, huh.
Wendy: Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.
Stan: I know.
Police Chief: Come on you!
Frans: You're hurting my arm!
Police Chief: Too bad! You'll be going away for a long time. Was it worth it?
Frans: In a way, it was. I might not have gotten away, but... at least I learned a lot about Pioneer life in the Old West. Those early settlers didn't have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today. To think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin' as simple as washing your clothes. Pioneer Village has a lot to teach us all.
Cartman: Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
Kenny: (Damn.)
Kyle: Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
Stan: Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
Stan: How?
Stan: You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
Butters: Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
Butters: Uhuh, Eric.
Cartman: Butters, I need your help.
Butters: Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent.
Cartman: The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
Butters: The Chinese?
Cartman: I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
Butters: Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
Cartman: You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
Butters: Why are they gonna kill my parents?
Butters: I don't want my parents to die.
Butters: Well sure.
Kyle: No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
Stan: Let's get out of here!
Kyle: We can't just leave!
Stan: Come on!
Stan: Oh God!
Kyle: Somebody do something!
Clyde: Why are they doing this?!
Kyle: Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
Kyle: WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
Jimmy: We can't help him now.
Butters: Well I thought it was pretty good.
Butters: I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
Butters: But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
Butters: Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.
Cartman: It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
Greeter: Uh, can I help you?
Butters: Yeah.
Cartman: Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
Butters: Stay calm, Eric.
Cartman: So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
Butters: Fing fong ting tong.
Cartman: Ting ton teetong.
Jimmy: And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen.
Stan: Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
Spielberg: Hold him, Lucas! Come on!
Stan: No, stop! Raape!
Cartman: All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
Butters: Okay, okay.
Cartman: Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
Butters: Huh, invasion pran.
Father: 'Scuse me, miss?
Greeter: Yes sir?
Father: These people won't leave us alone.
Father: You aren't Chinese.
Cartman: Oh my God...
Butters: We're busted! Uh what do we do??
Greeter: Okay, why don't we go...
Butters: A gun?
Cartman: Hold the gun on them Butters!
Butters: I don't want a gun, Eric!
Cartman: They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
Butters: Oh jeez...
Patron: This is stupid. I'm leaving!
Cartman: Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
Cartman: Shoot him, Butters!
Butters: No!
Cartman: You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
Patron: Ow! A-Ah! A-Ooowww!
Cartman: Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
Butters: Huh?
Cartman: That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
Butters: But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
Kyle: I love you too.
Stan: Wh-why?
Stormy: You don't have a case here. You can't really say that Spielberg and Lucas raped Indiana Jones in the new film.
Stan: Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
Kyle: Indy deserved more than that!
Spielberg: COME ON BIG GUY!
Father: Look, we don't know what you're talking about. There's no Chinese plan to take over America.
Captain: You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you.
Butters: Uhwhat?
Officer: The President?
Captain: All right men, come on. We're going in.
Cartman: Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
Cartman: God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
Butters: Aw, I did it again?
Stormy: It's all right there in front of you, Detective. Five sworn statements from these... brave boys. It's now up to you.
Det. Yates: Are you nuts?! I'm not going out and arresting Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
Stan: But they raped Indiana Jones!
Jimmy: ...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?
Indy: Drop?
Spielberg: Just take 'em right off.
Indy: Uh what do you guys want?
Indy: We-eee!
Spielberg: Squeal louder. Weeee!
Spielberg: Louder louder! Weeee!
Indy: No...
Spielberg: Yes, sir! Come on, squeal! Weeeeee!
Butters: They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
Butters: Uh, not exactly.
Butters: Well it's not where I aimed, honest.
Cartman: Dude...
Butters: I seriously didn't mean it.
Butters: What? Uh where are you going, Eric?
Butters: By, by my, by myself?
Lucas: Hm this is bullshit!
Det. Yates: Boys, we got 'em.
Kyle: What?
Stan: So, what now?
Jimmy: Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this?
Clyde: What do we do?
Kyle: We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
Captain: Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out.
Father: There's nothing to sort out! These kids need to be put in jail!
Officer 1: Sir! Sir, it's over. They got 'em.
Captain: Got who?
Officer 2: They got 'em. It's over.
Father: That means... they'll never be free to rape again.
Officer 4: I love you.
Butters: So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
Wendy: Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
Wendy: This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!
Butters: I don't wanna get killed by boobs.
Wendy: Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
Cartman: I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
Wendy: What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!
Cartman: Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
Wendy: I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
Cartman: Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?
Wendy: That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!
Wendy: You think you're tough?
Wendy: I'll smack the shit out of you!
Cartman: Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
Wendy: After school! We fight after school! You got that?!
Cartman: You're gonna fight me after school?
Wendy: That's right!
Cartman: You're a chick, dude.
Stan: What?
Kindergartners: Yaaay!
Butters: Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
Token: She is pissed off.
Cartman: She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
Jimmy: Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
Cartman: Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
Wendy: What?!
Wendy: What?
Wendy: If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!
Wendy: No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!
Wendy: Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
Cartman: Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
Wendy: I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
Michael: So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend.
Stan: I guess so.
Michael: Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends.
Craig: Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off.
Jimmy: I'll bet she is!
Wendy: What?!
Wendy: You really think that's gonna work on me?!
Wendy: You can't bribe your way out of this!
Wendy: No you don't.
Cartman: Eat my underwear?
Wendy: That's right.
Wendy: Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!
Cartman: No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
Wendy: You fucking suck so hard!!
Wendy: Oh my God!
Wendy: No!
Cartman: Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.
Stan: What?
Cartman: You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
Stan: Yeah?
Cartman: Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
Cartman: Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
Stan: Really?
Stan: Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
Bebe: Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!
Mr. Garrison: And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
Clyde: I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.
Mr. Garrison: Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?
Cartman: What?! That's ridiculous!
Butters: But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
Cartman: That's not why I did it.
Craig: Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?
Butters: That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"
Cartman: Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
Craig: Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow.
Jimmy: Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
Butters: That way it won't matter if you get detention.
Mrs. Testaburger: Wendy?
Wendy: Yeah?
Wendy: What? No!
Wendy: You don't understand. He said horrible things.
Mrs. Testaburger: Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that?
Mrs. Testaburger: Wendy, you tell this little boy you aren't going to hurt him!
Wendy: Mom, you don't-
Mrs. Testaburger: Now, young lady.
Wendy: I'm not going to hurt you.
Mr. Testaburger: If there is any word of you fighting at school it's over for you, missy! Do you understand?!
Wendy: Yes sir.
Mrs. Testaburger: We're so sorry about this, Ms. Cartman.
Mrs. Testaburger: It won't happen again.
Cartman: Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
Butters: Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
Cartman: Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
Bebe: Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?
Wendy: I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
Cartman: Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
Butters: Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
Cartman: I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
Bebe: Come on Wendy, kick his ass!
Butters: She chickened out!
Cartman: Told you guys.
Stan: Ugh, I'm glad that's over with.
Jimmy: I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.
Cartman: What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey
Mr. Garrison: Okay Eric, that's enough you smartass!
Principal Victoria: Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman.
Wendy: No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight.
Principal Victoria: Oh no? Are you sure?
Wendy: Yes ma'am!
Wendy: Ma'am?
Principal Victoria: When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!
Bebe: She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!
Cartman: Butters, get out of here!
Butters: But Wendy's coming to fight you.
Clyde: Oh boy here we go!
Craig: All right, let's DO IT!
Cartman: Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
Kids: Ohhhhh!
Butters: Fuck him up, Wendy!
Stan: Dude, we never thought you were cool.
Cartman: That's not true. You're just saying that.
Kyle: No, really. We've always thought you suck.
Jimmy: Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.
Cartman: You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
Carig: No, it's true. We've always hated you.
Butters: Well, yeah.
Craig: What?
Kyle: I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
Kenny: (Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)
Cartman: Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
Kenny: ('Cause girls like shaved balls.)
Kyle: Girls like shaved balls?
Kenny: (Yes they do.)
Cartman: What girl is gonna see your balls?
Cartman: Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
Stan: I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
Cartman: Shut up already!
Stan: They're in London too?
Sharon: All right kids, dig in.
Stan: Where's dad?
Stan: Why?
Sharon: Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
Sharon: Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
Shelly: Turn it off, Dad!
Stan: You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
Cartman: So?
Stan: So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
Cartman: How much?
Stan: Over two hundred bucks.
Kyle: Two hundred dollars?
Cartman: Really? Are you sure?
Kyle: ...Become a Peruvian flute band?
Stan: Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
Stan: Yeah!
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Cartman: Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
Craig: ...Fine.
Cartman: Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
Craig: ...Yeah.
Cartman: Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
Craig: What do you guys want?
Craig: You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
Cartman: And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
Cartman: Craig, don't be an asshole.
Stan: All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
Man 1: Wow, that's such cultural music.
Man 2: Very cultural, yes.
Kyle: Gracias.
Kyle: This is awesome!
Cartman: No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
Kyle: God damn it!
Cartman: No! No es bueno! [grabs the siku and throws it away. The band stops playing. The siku player looks at his empty hands and goes after the siku]
Stan: Jesus Christ!
Cartman: No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!
Senator 1: A pan-demic?
Michael Chertoff: Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands. We will need every resource available to see this through.
Senator 2: Excuse me, but... aid other countries?
Michael Chertoff: Senator?
Senator 2: With all due respect we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands! Let other countries fend for themselves!
Soldier 2: Let's go! Get 'em out!
Soldier 3: Clear out, move! This is a Homeland Security operation, people, let's go!
Stan: Hey, back off!
Kyle: Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
Guard: Get back! I'm not buying any of your damned CDs!
Stan: No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
Guard: I said I'm not buying any God damned CDs today, you got that?! I'm sick of it!
Kenny: (Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)
Michael Chertoff: Attention Peruvian flute bands
Translator: Atencione bandas de flauta Per.
Michael Chertoff: We appreciate your cooperation and patience.
Translator: Cooperacion y peciencia es apreciado.
Michael Chertoff: Tomorrow you will be boarding ships...
Translator: Maana sera el embarque de barcos...
Michael Chertoff: ...which will take you to Guantanamo Bay.
Translator: ...que la lleva a viajar Guantanimo.
Michael Chertoff: There you will spend the rest of your lives.
Kyle: Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
Stan: Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
Sharon: Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?
Mrs. Tucker: No, I'm telling you. This isn't like Craig at all. I'm really worried.
Mr. Tucker: You've checked with the police?
Gerald: Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!
Randy: Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.
Sharon: Well then stop being an idiot and help!
Mr. Tucker: Maybe the boys all ran away. Were any of your boys upset about anything?
Gerald: All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
Sheila: That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
Mrs. Tucker: What is that supposed to mean?
Sharon: To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.
Sharon: I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-
Mr. Tucker: Like every kid doesn't have some problems!
Sheila: Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.
Mrs. Tucker: Oh my God
Mr. Tucker: This is ridiculous!
Gerlad: That's not ridicul-
Michael Chertoff: Calm down people, we still have work to do! We have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again!
Official 1: We don't know where they came from, sir. We... we've been researching, but we... can't figure it out.
Official 1: Hmm...
Michael Chertoff: The country is in the name!
Official 2: No. Sir, we checked the entire map. There isn't a country called Peruvian anywhere.
Official 3: Peh-roo.
Michael Chertoff: Now I want a plan in place to take out Peru once and for all!
Official 1: Is that really necessary, sir? It seems a little extreme.
Soldier 2: Yeah.
Chief Aide: Sir, you'd better come quick. One of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape.
Stan: This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
Michael Chertoff: Right. You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a llama, but you're not a Peruvian flute band.
Stan: We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
Kyle: We just wanna go home.
Kenny: (Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)
Michael Chertoff: Which tourist location were they playing at?
Chief Aide: An outdoor mall in Colorado.
Stan: We we speak English!
Cartman: And we're white.
Chief Aide: I don't know what to make of it sir. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Clearly they are a Peruvian flute band and yet they... aren't. They play pan flute music like the others, but they talk and act like ...one of us.
Michael Chertoff: I agree. They're obviously some kind of... hybrid.
Official 1: A hybrid? Ah how is that possible?
Chief Aide: Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated with one of our females. Who knows?
Official 1: Sir?
stan: Help you how?
Craig: Can we please just go home, sir?
Stan: Kyle, calm down.
Kyle: You know I can't go there, Stan!
Michael Chertoff: You don't have a choice! Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.
Musician 2: Por favor! No podemos ir! Estamos aqu para proteger a ustedes!
Musician 3: S.
Other Musicians: S. No podemos ir. Si, protectores.
Thompson: They're saying something like, "You can't send us away. We are the protectors."
Soldier 3: Protectors from what?
Musician 2: La muerte peluda! La muerte peluda!
Soldier 3: What does that mean?
Thompson: I think he said, "the furry death"?
Musician 2: La muerte peluda! La muerte peluda!
Anchorman Tom: The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world. Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade and Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect.
Anchorman Tom: Paul Paul, what do you see?
Kyle: That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
Stan: Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
Craig: You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?
Cartman: There's no talking to this guy.
Stan: All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
Craig: That would be great. Thank you.
Kyle: This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
Kenny: (Because they're trying to take over the world?)
Kyle: Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
Randy: Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
Sharon: Oh my God.
Randy: What's going on?
Mr. Garrison: They're all over the place!
Randy: What are?!
Randy: Oh my Gohhhd!
Michael Chertoff: You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis, did you know that?
Davis: Sir?
Davis: You... You... knew this was going to happen.
Stan: We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
Kyle: Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
Cpt. Taylor: I don't get it. They said the military would meet us here.
A Voice: This is Connor in Washington.
Cpt. Taylor: Hey, Connor, the place that Homeland Security told us to start the operation, there, there's nobody here to meet us. It's like they sent us to no man's land.
Connor: Jesus they're everywhere!
Cpt. Taylor: What are everywhere?
Connor: ...so furry! They're attacking... every city... ha- people dying... Ha-... guinea pigs... all over! Agh.
Stan: Guinea pigs?
Sharon: Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.
Sharon: Guinea pigs?
Reporter: Reports of attacks are coming in from major cities all over the world.
Randy: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
Randy: Gotta get out!
Cpt. Taylor: ...Yes, that was the order.
Kyle: And that makes sense to you?
Cpt. Taylor: Nope, not at all.
Cpt. Gabriel: Actually, the whole rounding up of the pan flute bands didn't make sense to any of us either.
Stan: None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
Craig: Oh, that's awesome.
Kyle: So we've gotta find another way out of here.
Cpt. Taylor: It's starting to look that way, yeah.
Craig: This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.
Cartman: You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Cartman: Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
Michael Chertoff: What about the pan flute bands? Are they on their way to Guantanamo Bay?
Official 1: ...Sir, we believe we have bigger problems right now than pan flute bands.
Michael Chertoff: Have they been loaded onto the boats or not?!
Official 2: No sir. We diverted all the resources away from the pan flute bands to deal with the guinea pigs.
Randy: Oh Jesus!
Shelly: It's gonna kill us!
Randy: Here we see a view from outside the bus.
Cpt. Gabriel: I don't know, Lemsky. This entire area of Peru isn't even charted on the maps.
Cpt. Gabriel: Take a look at this! They look like... beehive combs.
Cpt. Taylor: Oh my God.
Stan: Dude, what is this place?
Cpt. Taylor: It's like... an unknown valley that time forgot, where everything grows huge.
Craig: That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.
Kyle: Yeah. Stuff just happens.
Craig: Stuff just happens.
Kyle: That's right!
Craig: You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.
Cartman: That's right.
Craig: You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.
Cpt. Taylor: Look, wherever we are, I think we'd better keep moving.
Cpt. Taylor: Ohhh stop it, make it stohhhp!
Randy: All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.
Butters: Hello, heh.
Linda: What is that? Chris, what is that?
Stephen: Oh God look!
Sharon: Those aren't guinea pigs.
An Anchorman: And we are now getting word of giant bees. The giant bees have been seen in the U.S. and Europe.
Kyle: Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
Cartman: What is it?
Kyle: I don't know. It's old.
Stan: Let's see what's in there.
Craig: "Let's see what's in there." That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say "Let's see what's in there."
Stan: It might be a way out, Craig!
Kyle: Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
Kenny: (Yeah. Totally.)
Kyle: Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.
Cartman: Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
Cartman: Dude, it's Craig!
Craig: What?
Stan: Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?
Craig: I have no idea.
Craig: I don't know.
Top Official: There is now word of huge beehives forming in cities across the U.S. and Canada. Europe and China are reporting deaths by guinea pigs in the tens of thousands.
Michael Chertoff: And how are the efforts to contain all this going?
Top Official: Uh, sir?
Michael Chertoff: Ah I'm sorry, I just thought of a funny joke.
Official 1: Oh, a-hah.
Michael Chertoff: All right, get the jets ready. I need to get to Machu Picchu.
Soldier:: Uh, Machu Picchu, sir?
Michael Chertoff: Yes, I need to be taken to Machu Picchu! Have you lost your hearing?!
Official 1: But S-sir, what could possibly be at Machu Picchu to help the-
Sharon: Can we get out through the highway?
Soldier 5: The highway is unreachable; there's guinea rats all over it.
Mr. Garrison: Guinea rats?
Mr. Garrison: What do you mean "guinea rats"?
Soldier 5: Look, there are guinea pigs, but there's also guinea bees, guinea rats. I've even seen some guinea spiders out there.
Stephen: Look, I, I think we need to find a way out under the city.
Mr. Garrison: In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.
A Woman: Oh my God!
Townsman 3: Something's inside the store!
Townsman 5: God they're everywhere!
Townswoman 1: Travis! No!
Randy: You can't help him!
Stephen: There's something over there!
Townsman 7: It's a guinea bear!
Townswoman 2: Kill me!
Shelly: Mom, I can't see.
Sharon: What what what what?
Stan: Let's head over this way, guys.
Kyle: Hear that? It sounds like water.
Cartman: Yeah, it's coming from up there.
Cartman: Dude, that's awesome.
Craig: No.
Stan: Wait, whattaya mean no?
Craig: I'm not following you guys any more.
Stan: Dude, we we have to go check this out.
Craig: Why?
Stan: 'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
Craig: Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because "that's just the way it is."
Stan: Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
Craig: I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.
Kyle: How do you do that?
Stan: Craig, dude, wait up.
Craig: No.
Craig: ...Nope.
Craig: Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.
Randy: It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys.
Randy: What is it?
Shelly: Oh my Gohhhd!
Randy: Oh no, I'm way too startled!
Sharon: Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!
Soldier 6: What's he doing?
Cartman: Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
Soldier 6: Sir, ih-is everything all right?
Michael Chertoff: Shoot them!
Soldier 7: Shoot them?
Michael Chertoff: They're a Peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained.
Michael Chertoff: I said shoot them!
Kyle: Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
Top Official: Maybe we should look at it, sir.
Michael Chertoff: Damn you Craiiig! You just don't ever stop, do you?!
Craig: I didn't say anything.
Top Official: You're, you're some kind of monster.
Stan: Jesus Christ!
Michael Chertoff: Dargh, no!
Craig: Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.
Cartman: That guy's an asshole!
Kyle: Yeah, what a dick!
Kenny: (I fuckin' hate Craig!)
New Director: What now?!
Top Official 2: The former director of Homeland Security, that turned out to be a guinea pig? It attacked the guards, got out of its holding cell.
New Director: My God, are you telling me..?
Obama: It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America.
Randy: Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!
Obama: Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. We will name him "Sparkles".
Obama: Where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we cant, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can.
Mrs. Harris: We did it!
Mr. Adler: Everything is going to be awesome now!
Randy: This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
Linda Black: I don't even know what to do now.
Stephen: Oh, shut up!
Crowd: Looosers!
Butters: We lost?
Supporters: No no! Noo nooo!
Butters: Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
Linda: Stephen!
Stephen: It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead.
Linda: You don't know that, Stephen!
Mr. Garrison: We'll probably be dead by sunrise!
Randy: WOOOO Obama!
Mr. Garrison: Get out o'here!
Stan: No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
Reporter 1: Uh Mr. President, over here!
Reporter 2: Congratulations!
Reporter 3: Great start, great job!
Reporter 4: Change!
Reporter 5: Great job, Mr. President!
Reporter 6: Great job, Obama!
McCain, Obama: Boom, baby!
Obama: You played it perfectly, there was no way.
McCain: It's McCain, we did it! Obama is President.
Davis: Yeah, so I've heard. You guys are out of your freakin' minds, you know that?
McCain: Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours.
Davis: Sure. Hard part's over, right?
McCain: Actually, the hard part's just starting.
Reveler 2: Obama yeah, I can't believe it!
Randy: O ba ma! O ba ma!
Revelers: O ba ma! O ba ma!
Crowd: Obama!
Barbrady: Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!
Reveler: ...party Obama!
Barbrady: Come on, time to go home.
Randy: What are you? A McCain voter?
Crowd: Yeah!
Crowd: Obama! Obama!
Barbrady: No! No! Hey, stop it!
Stan: Jesus Christ...
Quincy: Bravo Obama and McCain. Ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally pulled it off!
McCain: Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever.
Neely: I knew it! I knew when you two ran for President you were just working an angle.
Obama: Always workin' the angles.
McCain: My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history.
Obama: The Hope Diamond, rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world. Going street value, Middle-Eastern market, of course, two hundred and ten million dollars.
Davis: Two hundred ten?
McCain: Million.
Quincy: No no no, the Hope Diamond is ungettable. Every thief in the world knows that.
Davis: So you go in from the roof, drop into it from the top.
Obama: Can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse.
Neely, Davis: Boom, baby!
McCain: You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on.
Quincy: So you both run for President because one of you has to win, and you've got your access to the tunnel.
McCain: And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours.
Quincy: This all sounds very risky.
Neely: And we are.
Kyle: Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
Kyle: What?!
Stan: Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
Stan, Kyle: NOO!
Chief of Security: All right, everyone, I'm turning in for the night. Go to standard security, team 3.
SS Agent: Sir! S-sir, we have a bit of a problem.
Chief of Security: What?
SS Agent: The new President-elect is here. Eh he wants into the Oval Office.
SS Agent 2: They're all, they're all right through here, sir.
Obama: Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys?
Chief of Security: Good, sir.
Obama: I'd like to see the Oval Office, please?
Chief of Security: Right now?
Obama: I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I wanna redecorate, if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff.
Obama: All right, McCain. I'm in.
Reveler 3: Yehhheheah!
Reveler 4: Change.
Reveler 5: Change.
Randy: Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.
Stan: No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
Randy: We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.
Stan: Dude, he's wasted.
Randy's Boss: Oh, hello Marsh.
Randy's Boss: Huh?
Randy: You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!
Randy's Boss: Hey, I voted for Obama.
Randy: Obama's not talkin' about you!
Reporter 1: Uh Mrs. Palin, have you seen or heard from John McCain?
McCain: Hello Sarah, it's McCain.
Obama: I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. I should be almost below the museum.
Palin: Just make sure you don't blow the transformers along with the tunnel because it will trigger the five-four laser system! And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Gary shuts down the grid. I'll be there in thirty.
Obama: God she's awesome.
Guard 1: What's that noise?
Cartman: There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
Jimmy: Yeah. Where the hell have you guys ...been?
Craig: Peru.
Millie: Bridon Gueermo? Oh he's such a dream!
Red: I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody.
Girls' Table: - Together as one -
Mr. Mackey: Dialog
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, now right-click on menu item "Equate O" and type in "input y".
Stan: No, I'm on the Japanese side.
Cartman: Oh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
Stan: Dude, what?
Butters: There's vampires in the school!
Stan: What?
Butters: Vampires. I've seen 'em.
Stan: Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!
Red: Not a cheat if you rank up.
Kyle: Butters, there's no such thing as vampires.
Cartman: All right Butters, well you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
Butters: Really? Do you think that's best?
Cartman: Yeah, now get out of here.
Cartman: Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
Lead Vampire: Isn't this cool? This time of day nobody's in the gym. We should make this one of our official South Park Vampires Club hangouts.
Spiky Vampire: That's an awesome new coat, Mike. Looks totally badass.
Vampir: Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now.
Spiky Vampire: Oh, that's cool.
Vampir: Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire, in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se.
Spiky Vampire: Heh, yeah, I'm gonna be a hybrid vampire, both psi and sanguinarian.
Butters: That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
Bloodrayne: Lunchtime's almost over. Should we drink some more blood?
Other Vampires: Yeah! Cool!
Vampir: Ummm, what are you doing?
Bloodrayne: That kid was really scared of us.
Vampir: That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se.
Pete: What the hell are those kids doing?
Henrietta: Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?
Pete: Are they trying to be Goth?
Michael: No, they're vamp. They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice.
Henrietta: But they can't dress like that. That's our style.
Midnight Vampire: Hey, Tommy Petros is thinking he might wanna be a Vamp kid too.
Vampir: Tommy Petros? Is he cool?
Bloodrayne: Yeah, he's cool enough.
Pete: So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?
Vampir: We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se.
Michael: Aren't you Mike Makowski?
Vampir: That's Vampir Makowski now.
Henrietta: You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!
Sparkly Vampire: Hey, we're just as dark as you guys, maybe darker!
Pete: Really. Do you guys even smoke?
Vampir: Of course not. Smoking's bad for you.
Other Vamps: Yeah.
Vampir: You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se.
Butters: Mom, mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
Butters: Oh no, what'd I do this time?
Linda: You just march on in there.
Butters: I have no idea, sir.
Butters: Uh, I'm sorry, Dad. I-it's just I've been really preoccupied lately. See, there are these kids at school, they were-
Stephen: What keeps a family together, Butters?!
Butters: A well-organized pantry.
Butters: Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
Stephen: You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!
Sparkly Vampire: What is that kid doing?
Vampir: So?
Butters: O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
Vampir: What?
Butters: Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.
Cowlick Vampire: You're not cool enough to be one of us.
Butters: Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
Vampir: We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.
Butters: Yes! Yes, anything else?
Midnight Vampire: I want some Cheetos.
Butters: Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
Singer: I'm not part of your society. I don't follow your fads and rules. Doctrines...
Boy 1: Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?
Michael: So lame. So... lame...
Henrietta: You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.
Little Vamp: See? Isn't it cool back here? It's all dark and isolated.
Shades Vamp: This would be a great place for a Vampire meeting.
Henrietta: Get out of our space, you little twerps!
Pete: More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?
Butters: Yeah, I guess.
Vampir: Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave.
Butters: Well I'm sick of bein'- bein' pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
Butters: Whoa.
Butters: I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
Linda: What on Earth?
Stephen: That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!
Principal Victoria: Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this "vampire" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.
Pete: ...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.
Principal Victoria: I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the "in" thing right now, but-
Pete: We aren't trying to be popular!
Vampir: Oh, oh no, are we in trouble?
Principal Victoria: I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-
Vampir: Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se.
Michael: Allison Merch is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop.
Boy 1: It went this way?
Michael: So we're back to that, are we?
Firkle: Shit.
Butters: I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
Cartman: Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
Liane: You all right, sweetie?
Liane: What's going on?
Cartman: Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
Liane: Oh dear.
Cartman: Yes.
Michael: I walked into the cafeteria today. Rebecca Miller and Philip Russ were dressed like vampires drinking Clamato juice with four kids from the football team.
Firkle: Jesus.
Pete: It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening, I mean... why now?
Michael: Doesn't matter why. Pretty soon, the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happy-go-lucky vampire wannabes.
Henrietta: It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.
Pete: Whattaya mean?
Henrietta: I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.
Pete: Does your mom know you took her car?
Henrietta: Do I care?
Michael: All right, this is probably good enough.
Michael: What should we do with him?
Pete: Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.
Vampir: (No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)
Vampir: (I'm not really a vampire.)
Pete: If we get the right packaging, we can just FedEx him somewhere far way.
Michael: How about we send him to Transylvania?
Pete: No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.
Henrietta: If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.
Butters: What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
Stephen: AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!
Butters: I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
Michael: I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires.
Henrietta: He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.
Henrietta: Leave us alone!
Pete: They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!
Waitress: Looks the same to me.
Pete: I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.
Henrietta: Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village Inn from us too.
Pete: Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. Freakin' vampires beat us.
Henrietta: Get away, douchebag.
Butters: Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
Pete: What are you talking about?
Pete: Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?
Butters: Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
Michael: Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything.
Pete: How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!
Henrietta: Well, I think we all know what has to be done.
Michael: Yup.
Clerk: Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
Spiky Vamp: What the hell are they doing??
Stephen: What?
Butters: Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
Linda: We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.
Stephen: That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.
Butters: What's that, Dad?
Stephen: Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!
Butters: Uh oh.
Stephen: Butters, you are grounded!
Butters: Aw, dang it![walks up the stairs to his room.]
Michael: Fuck all of you.
Cartman: Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
Stan: I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
Kyle: Yeah, it's just so astounding.
Craig: Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend.
Kyle: This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
Jimmy: Well, so, w-who is she?
Cartman: Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
Stan: What?
Stan: Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
Butters: Um, does Kenny like her?
Kyle: I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
Butters: Oh, no. Oh, geez!
Butters: Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
Kyle: What?!
Butters: It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. "Tammy Warner is a total slut!"
Cartman: That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
Jimmy: Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me.
Butters: Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?
Kenny: (Oh, hi, guys.)
Stan: Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
Kenny: (What about her?)
Kyle: Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
Kenny: (But what?)
Kyle: W-well, we've heard that she's...
Cartman: Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
Tammy: Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school?
Kenny: (Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)
Tammy: TGI Friday's?
Kenny: (Yep. I like the food!)
Kenny: (Jonas Brothers?)
Clerk: There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.
Kyle: Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
Kenny: (Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)
Stan: A B.J.?
Kyle: You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
Kenny: (Of course, dude!)
Stan: Yeah, dude, that's gross.
Kyle: What kind of protection?
Kenny: (I'd like a box of condoms, please.)
Clerk 2: Box of condoms. Certainly, little boy. What kind would you like?
Kenny: (Uhm, I'll take one of those.)
Kyle: Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
Kenny: (No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)
Joe: Bay-bay! I'm hot.
Nick Jonas: He's hot.
Joe: Tell me how was I to know?
Jonas Brothers: You'd take your love and go.
Joe: Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...
Jonas Brothers: To put my arm around you?
Joe: The seasons change.
Kevin Jonas: Bay-bay!
Joe: And the world goes round.
Nick: The world goes round and round and round.
Nick: Love you, bay-bay!
Kevin: Bay-bay!
Tammy: Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!
Usher: And, uh, you too, little girl in the red.
Tammy: They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God!
Usher: All right, right this way, girls.
Girl in Puppy T-shirt: Why do you think they called us back here?
Fat Girl: They must-a wanna have sex with us.
Tammy: What? You think so?
Fat Girl: Sure, they're a band. They called us back here so we can give them blowjobs.
Girl in Puppy T-shirt: Well, I'm not doing it! Just 'cause they're rock stars doesn't mean I'll do that!
Girl in O T-shirt: Yeah, I'm not giving a blowjob to anybody!
Joe: Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience.
Nick: Yeah, you were getting a little crazy out there.
Fat Girl: Let's just get to the blowjobs.
Joe: Blow whats?
Nick: And see if you'll wear purity rings from now on.
Joe: We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.
Kevin: And it means we stay away from bad stuff and avoid people who swear and watch naughty TV shows.
Nick: That's just how we roll.
Kevin: Yeah.
Joe: So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?
Kevin: And be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll.
Cartman: Well well well, here he comes. It's B.J. McKay and his best friend Bear.
Kyle: What's that?
Kenny: (A purity ring.)
Cartman: Purity ring?
Kenny: (Yeah, it's a purity ring.)
Kyle: ...Well, what does that mean?
Kenny: (It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
Stan: Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a B.J. before you got too old an-
Kenny: (I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
Kyle: Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting B.J.s anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
Kyle: Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
Butters: Uh, what's that?
Stan: They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
Purity Boy 1: Yeah, we found out that once you wear purity rings, it's best to hang out with other couples that do. Got more in common. Isn't that right, Sarah?
Purity Boy 3: Sure is sweet.
Director: Aaand cut. Great video shoot, guys.
Joe: This is bullpucky!
Kevin: Yeah, we've had it, Goshdarnit!
Director: Uh oh, looks like we've got a problem.
Joe: Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!
Kevin: Yeah, you tell 'em, Joe.
Disney Exec 1: Boys, I know you're tired, but the purity rings are important to the company's image.
Joe: We don't care about the company.
Director: And you're gonna say that to the boss's face?
Kevin: We aren'--we aren't afraid of him.
Disney Exec 2: Well, I hope you're right, because the boss is on his way here. Now.
Kevin: Let's be strong, guys.
Mickey: So uh, I guess we have some issues, haha?
Kevin: We... need to talk about something.
Mickey: Oh boy! I just love flying all the way to Colorado to hear about your problems, haha.
Joe: Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings.
Mickey: Oh Gosh, fellas, let me explain this to you one more time. You have to wear the purity rings because that's how we can sell sex to little girls, haha. See, if we make the posters with little girls reaching for your junk, then you have to wear purity rings or else Disney Company looks baaad, haha.
Joe: Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.
Mickey: The rings stay on!
Nick: No, sir.
Kevin: No, Mr. Mouse.
Stan: Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
Kyle: We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
Stan: Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
Kyle: It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
Kyle: Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
Kenny: (Yeah...)
Announcer: Live from Five News Studio in Colorado, it's Good Mornin' Denver.
Joe: Hello.
Host: Now, tell us what you're doin' here in Denver, guys.
Joe: Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel.
Host: Now, guys, a lot has been made about your "purity rings". Can you tell us about those?
Nick: Uh huh.
Joe: Yeah. Uh huh.
Kevin: Yeah.
Nick: Yeah.
Stan: Excuse us. Excuse us.
Girl 2: Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
Host: That's great stuff, boys. You like takin' the Jonas Brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?
Cartman: Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
Stan: Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
Joe: Huh?
Kyle: What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
Kyle: Cartman?
Voice 1: Fifteen minutes, that's fifteen minutes, people!
Voice 2: Get another mic on that drum kit!
Stan: We... don't work for anybody.
Cartman: The hell did you do to us?!
Male Host: Truly a night of magic as we're set for the biggest concert event of the year!
Female Host: In about ten minutes, the Jonas Brothers are going to take the stage in what Disney is calling "the most pure and innocent rock event of the millennia."
Blonde Girl: Do we put the 3-D glasses on now, da-da?
Father: Not yet, Katie.
Male Host: Everyone around the country is tuning in to see Disney's latest kid pop stars.
Male Host: We understand the Jonas Brothers are getting ready. What's going on backstage must be exciting.
Stan: We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
Kyle: We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
Mickey: You're lying! I'll cut you up, haha!
Joe: You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.
Kevin: We've all angered God.
Audience: BOOO!!
Mickey: Now now, take it easy, haha. Here's the Jonas Brothers.
Mickey: No! Stop! Bring them back here!
Roadie: It's over, Mr. Mouse. Everyone's tuning out.
Reporter: Tom, the Disney Jonas Brothers 3D Television Special has failed, costing the Disney Company millions, and once again Mickey is pissed off and throwing a fit.
Tammy: Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring.
Tammy: Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.
Tammy: Oh I feel better already!
Kenny: (Me too!)
Tammy: What say you and me... go to TGI Fridays?
Father Maxi: And so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection. This young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee... For the world of oral sex is a world...
Kyle: Well, now we know.
Cartman: And knowing is half the battle.
Josh: Lisa I had a really great time tonight.
Lisa: I did too, Josh.
Josh: Would you... mind very much if I kissed you?
Lisa: O-hoh, yes Josh. Yehehessss!
The Coon: You aren't raping anyone tonight!
Lisa: Ah!
Josh: Oh! Ow! Wugh! Oh!
Josh: Ugh! L-lisa! Call me! Oh! Ow!
Officer 1: Here's that file on the Rodriguez case, detective.
The Coon: Don't let the city's peacefulness fool you, commissioner! It's too quiet.
Sgt. Yates: Oh, not this kid again.
Officer 1: Hey, you get out of here. Out.
Sgt. Yates: What?
The Coon: I think the Mayor might be involved. It's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash.
Officer 1: He's gone.
Sgt. Yates: Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents!
Officer 1: Jail's full, sir.
Sgt. Yates: All right, stop it!
Stan: Who's the Coon?
Kyle: ...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
Kyle: ...Dude, what?!
Cartman: He's not a fag!
M: Nuh uh.
The Coon: Yeah huh! You heard of the Coon and now you're being a copycat. Is that your name? Copycat?
M: I am Mysterion.
The Coon: Mysterion? That's fucking retarded! You just gave yourself away, Craig! Only you would think of a name that dumb!
Mysterion: I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.
The Coon: Yeah? Well you cannot know my true identity either.
Mysterion: I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.
Mysterion: I really don't care who you are.
The Coon: Oh all right Kyle! Yeah, took me real long to figure it out! Only you, Kyle, would be a buzzkill, and try to steal my thunder! You don't care about stopping crime, you're just doing this... 'cause you hate me, Kyle!
Mysterion: Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?
Maitre D: Got everything you need here, sir? Okay on beverages, buffet items?
The Coon: Yes, it's fine!
Maitre D: Great. Hey, I just want to say that the Airport Hilton really appreciates your continued business.
The Coon: What do you mean "continued"? You don't know who I am!
Maitre D: Aren't you that little boy who had his ginger pride rally and his AIDS benefit here, before?
The Coon: No, I'm not that kid!
Maitre D: Oh. Oh oh really? Oh my bad. I'm actually relieved. That kid was kind of a douchebag.
Liane: Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?
Cartman: I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
Cartman: I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
Anchor: Tonight an incredible story of an unknown child in South Park who has taken to the streets in an effort to fight crime.
Man 1: Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak.
Woman 1: He jumped down from the fire escape stairs, and then he just ran off. We barely got a look at him.
Man 2: To me it looked like Mysterion to me. Everyone who's seen Mysterion, say yeah!
Man 3: Well I, I think he's kind of a symbol for the town, you know? A, a symbol that everyone who's sick of crime can uh can rally behind.
Cartman: Fuckin' butthole!
Cartman: You gotta be kidding me!
Anchor: If you have any idea about the true identity of Mysterion, please call the 9 News Hotline.
Sgt. Yates: Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have?
Mysterion: There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.
The Coon: Dude, seriously? I'm gonna kick the shit out of you if you don't stop!
Mysterion: This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-
Mysterion, The Coon: Answer the call to save her.
The Coon: That's what I'm supposed to say! I know it's you, Kyle. Just stop!
Stan: Not really.
Stan: Dude, what the hell?
Clyde: Yeah, so do I.
Cartman: What?! Why?
Clyde: I don't know, it's just a cool costume.
Cartman: It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
A Voice: Hahahahahahahahaaa... Look what the cat dragged in.
The Coon: Come out where I can see you!
A Voice: What's the matter, Coon? Nervous?
Professor Chaos: Oh I'm close. And I'll put an end to him, and all of you goody-two-shoe heroes!
The Coon: I'm not on his side!
Professor Chaos: O- oh careful General Disarray.
The Coon: Agh- Stop it! You, you... butthole! Knock it off!
The Coon: Listen to me! I want to... help you... get rid of Mysterion!
Professor Chaos: But you both fight for justice and good.
The Coon: Yeah, but he's a fuckin' dick! I want him gone just as much as you do!
Professor Chaos: Very well. I will show you what we know about Mysterion's identity, but if this is some kind of setup-
The Coon: N- I'm the good guy, Chaos. I don't betray people.
Mysterion: Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.
Kyle: Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.
Mysterion: Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.
Kyle: Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
Kyle: Who? Me? Why?
Professor Chaos: This way! We will now show you our secret headquarters of DOOM.
The Coon: You guys have your own storage facility?
The Coon: I'll take a Sprite.
The Coon: You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...? Do you, do you still have that "Who Is The Coon?" T-shirt I gave you?
Professor Chaos: Oh yeah, I think it's around here somewhere. Uh, using our photos we are tryin' to pinpoint Mysterion's identity.
The Coon: Why is Cartman crossed out? He, he could be Mysterion.
The Coon: Alright, al, alright, alright, look, Chaos. Just set up a video camera. I know how we can put an end to Mysterion once and for all.
Anchor: Since the threat was issued there has been no sign of Mysterion. Where is Mysterion?
Professor Chaos: Hey Coon w-we aren't actually gonna blo- blow up anything, are we?
Professor Chaos: But you really wanna blow up a hospital? I mean, a-aren't you a good guy?
The Coon: Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos.
Professor Chaos: Aaah, a m m Mysterion, I b-, I beg you, I mean ah, judahadahada...
Mysterion: Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!
Professor Chaos: Waaugh!
Man 5: What is that?
Man 6: Look! Mysterion and Professor Chaos are fighting!
Officer 4: I think I can get a shot at Chaos, sir.
Professor Chaos: Yeah, we did it!
Reporter: The impossible has happened. Mysterion, beloved protector of the city, is dead. Who will save us now?
Man 10: Isn't that Bruce Vilanch?
Man 11: Be careful Bruce Vilanch! There are superhumans fighting right over there!
Professor Chaos: Okay sorry sorry! I'm sorry! I give up! Please, I give up!
The Coon: That was great teamwork, Mysterion. South Park is safe. Until next time.
Mysterion: What next time?
Sgt. Yates: Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante!
The Coon: Don't you think he knows that?! But superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good.
Man 12: Don't show your face, Mysterion!
Man 13: You have to be a symbol!
The Coon: So that the next terrorist can threaten South Park if he doesn't unmask himself?!
Crowd: Ohhh.
The Coon: I knew it was you! 'Member I even said it before!
Mr. Garrison: Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion.
Stan: Do I really have to do this, Dad?
Randy: Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.
Stan: But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
Benny: Okay, next please.
Benny: How can I help you, young man?
Stan: I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
Stan: Uh, what?
Benny: It's gone. It's all gone.
Stan: What's all gone?
Benny: The money in your account - it didn't do too well, it's gone.
Stan: What do you mean? I have a hundred dollars.
Benny: Not anymore you don't. POOF.
Stan: Well, what can I do to get back my money-?
Benny: I'm sorry sir, but this line is for bank members only.
Stan: I just opened an account.
Benny: Do you have any money invested in this bank?
Stan: No, you just lost it all!
Stan: Hey!
Benny: Hello Mrs. Farnickle, how are you today? Making a deposit are we? Great, we can just put that into your retirement account and make it go to work for you aaaaand it's gone.
Mrs. Farnickle: What?
Benny: Sorry, yeah, that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have money with the bank. Next please.
Stan: Dad!
Randy: Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
Announcer: This is a 9 News Special Report. RECESSION: A NATION IN PERIL.
Anchor: An economic crisis has hit South Park and the nation like never before. Another South Park bank has closed down, leaving thousands of people in debt.
Darryl Weathers: First the money started goin', and now everyone's gettin' laid off work! They took arrr jawbs!
Worker 1: They took our jobs!
Worker 3: Deeekerrdrrr!
Worker 4: Deeerkerrrrrrdrrrr!
Randy: Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
Sharon: You said we had to be careful with our money. I've got nothing for a food budget.
Stan: Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
Stan: Yeah, I think I get it.
Orator 1: And so why is our economy failing us? Because the government kept interest rates too low for too long! The government took our economy for granted and now we are all here paying the price! How long will we sit and watch our economy fall... As the people we must...
Orator 2: ...An angel came to me and so I say to you: Do not listen to the Wall Street brokers! For they are the ones that put us in this situation! Fat cats with corporate greed! They are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom! Our responsibility is...
Cartman: And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
Man 1: He's right.
Clerk: Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?
Stan: Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
Stan: What?
Clerk: I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?
Stan: So?
Clerk: Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.
Stan: Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
Gerald: What can we do, Randy?
Man 3: Yes tell us.
Man 4: Tell us.
Man 5: Tell us what to do.
Man 6: Tell us, Randy, what we should do!
Man 7: What should we do, Randy?!
Kyle: Well this sucks!
Clyde: Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
Kyle: You want something new every week, fatass.
Kyle: My fault?
Cartman: The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
Kyle: Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
Cartman: Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
Man 8: We best speak with the Council, and tell them... a young Jew is speaking heresy towards the Economy.
Receptionist: Can I help you?
Stan: I wanna return this Margaritaville.
Josh: Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?
Stan: No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.
Josh: Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah.
Stan: What?
Josh: Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm.
Stan: Wall Street?
Josh: Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah.
Stan: So?
Stephen: The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills.
Father Maxi: You've really done an amazing thing, Mr. Marsh. People have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the Economy's mighty sword.
Randy: I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.
Skeeter: We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online.
Randy: Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
Man 9: Council, I bring news of discord! A young Jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the Economy!
Randy: What?!
Man 9: He was saying that... your ideas are false and the Economy is not vengeful. He was rallying people to spend more!
Father Maxi: Spend more?! What mockery is this?!
Randy: Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?
Man 10: 'Scuse me, we need to borrow your squirrels.
Man 10: You have sinned!
Mr. Garrison: Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Please.
Kyle: What's going on?
Man 10: Garrison, you have brought your filth to this town for the last time!
Kyle: What did he do?
Man 11: Your teacher was caught buying a KitchenAid Stand Mixer at Bed Bath & Beyond!
Man 10: Move aside, kid! He must pay for his stand mixer.
Kyle: Come on, this is ridiculous!
Man 10: What's ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the Economy?!
Stan: 'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?
Stockbroker: Margaritaville?
Stan: My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
Stockbroker: Oh, that makes sense.
Stan: It does?
Stockbroker: You see, son, we lump thousands of these Margaritaville installment plans together into Margaritaville-based securities, then chop those securities up in a way that we could sell them to banks.
Stan: So I can return it to a bank?
Stockbroker: Nope, because a bunch of people like you are defaulting on their Margaritavilles so the government had to buy the Margaritaville assets from the banks.
Stan: What?!
Man 11: By all reports, the young Jew is not letting up! He is still going around convincing people to have faith in the Economy by shopping!
Randy: We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?
Stephen: Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us.
Father Maxi: Are you retarded, Stotch?! The Economy is omnipotent! Which means it can do anything! So saying it would be limited to one Son is fucking stupid!
Randy: That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!
Man 12: Well then, there's only one option: we have to kill the Jew.
Father Maxi: Yep, I think we gotta kill the Jew.
Treasurer 1: Uhh, how can we help you, young man?
Stan: I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
Treasurer 1: Ohhh that makes sense.
Stan: Nnnaaargh!
Treasurer 1: No problem. We just need to consult the chart. We can determine your property's value and we'll be done.
Treasurer 2: Excellent news, sir. We've determined the investment value of your Margaritaville to be... ninety trillion dollars.
Stan: What?!
Jimmy: Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out.
Kyle: I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
Butters: Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
Jimmy: Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.
Stan: Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
Treasurer 1: What, you think it's worth more?
Stan: No, dude, that doesn't make sense!
Treasurer 2: Well, you don't get ninety trillion dollars, but the chart says that's what it's worth.
Treasurer 2: What is it now?
Treasurer 3: Another insurance company is about to go under; if they do, people could lose millions!
Treasurer 3: Sirs, another insurance company is going under!
Treasurer 1: Bailout!
Treasurer 3: Most prudent move is a bailout!
Man 13: It's a miracle.
Randy: What is this? What's going on?
Randy: What's he doing?
Darryl: Hey thanks, kid, this is really nice of you.
Randy: But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
Man 15: So that people will have money to spend.
Kyle: It's okay, Ma.
Man 17: He's dead.
Cartman: Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
Wendy: Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?
Stan: What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!
Wendy: What day?
Butters: The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
Clyde: They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.
Red: Oh God, that show is so dumb.
Cartman: Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
Tweek: Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!
Bebe: Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!
Jimmy: We're finally gonna learn the shocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.
Wendy: God they're so stupid!
Stan: Oh boy!
Butters: This is gonna be great!
Craig: I've been waiting for this all week.
Butters: Oh boy!
Craig: Dude, I was here first.
Butters: Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!
Announcer: You are watching the Canada Channel, the only channel in Canada.
Announcer: ...will not be seen tonight, so that we may bring you this Queef Sisters Special!
Cartman: What?
Doctor: Alright Queef Sisters, it's time for your yearly PAP smear and vag exam.
Katie: Alright Doctor.
Katherine: I'm ready, Doctor.
Cartman: What the fuck is this?!
Doctor: Now listen heauh! If you queef in my face, then I refuse to be your gynecologist!
Katherine: I'm sorry, doctor. I had air trapped in my vagina.
Katie: Huhuhuhu!
Katherine: But doctor, what if I have cancer?
Butters: They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
Katie: Doctor, my sister is just being difficult. Maybe you can just examine my cervix instead.
Katherine: Oh Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry.
Katie: I guess so Katherine.
Cartman: Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
Phillip: What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
Terrance: Queef Sisters?!
Network President: That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out.
Terrance: You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!
Phillip: That's sick!
Network President: You think farts are funny; why not queefs?
Terrance: Because babies come from there!
Network President: Eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! You know, women empowerment and the get-go. So we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale!
Cartman: No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
Stan: We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
Cartman: You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
Clyde: I threw up on my way home.
Stan: You tell 'em, Cartman!
Red: What happened?
Kyle: It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
Bebe: Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
Bebe: I can't believe they're this upset.
Red: God, they're annoying!
Annie: I don't even know what a queef is.
Wendy: It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.
Annie: Oh.
Red: You know that girl Samantha Dunskin, she can make herself queef whenever she wants.
Bebe: Really?
Wendy: Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
Cartman: And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
Kyle: Robbed us of our innocence.
Cartman: Yes, that's good.
Wendy: Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you.
Stephen: Butters?
Sharon: Why? What happened?
Sharon: ...So?
Randy: Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
Stan: Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
Randy: I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.
Stan: It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
Randy: Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.
Gerald: How did this happen?
Stuart: Where were the teachers?!
Mrs. Testaburger: Whoa, whoa whoa, wait a minute. Are you saying we're all here just because a girl queefed on a boy?
Man: Just?!
Thomas: We're here to find out why?!
Katherine: Oh hello Regis.
Regis: So, uh, gals, ...you seem to really like queefing.
Regis: But I mean really, isn't queefing a bit juvenile?
Katie: Men enjoy farts, so why shouldn't women enjoy their queefs?
Network President: Terrance and Phillip, you've put on a terrific show for many many years. You've made Canada Channel what it is today. You're fired.
Terrance & Phillip: Fired?!
Terrance: Brian, don't do this!
Phillip: You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!
Randy: What was that?
Randy: Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?
Randy: Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
Randy: Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!
Stan: Stop it, Mom!
Randy: Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?
Randy: Sharon! Marsh!
Sharon: Ex-cuse me.
Sharon: Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!
Randy: That's completely different!
Stan: Yeah it's different, Mom!
Sharon: Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.
Sharon: But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.
Sharon: Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!
Katie: Look Katherine, I made queef cookies!
Katie: Oh my God! Look, Katherine! It's Canadian television stars Terrance & Phillip!
Phillip: May we come in, please?
Terrance: Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.
Terrance: All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!
Katie: Why kill us? We love you.
Terrance: Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!
Katherine: Oh. Well I suppose if we're going to die, we should die by the hands of our idols.
Terrance: Your idols?
Terrance: Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.
Cartman: Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
Butters: Oh. Hey fellas.
Cartman: We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
Butters: Aw thanks.
Stan: Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
Butters: Ohhhhh ohhhhh!
Kyle: Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
Butters: My, my picture?
Cartman: You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.
Phillip: Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!
Terrance: No, that was me, Phillip. I farted.
Terrance: Phillip?! I'm Terrance!
Katie: What? I thought you were Terrance.
Phillip: No, I'm Phillip!
Stephen: A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil.
Stan: On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
Other Women: That's right! We do.
Cartman: Sick! Stop it, lady!
Randy: Jesus Christ!
Phillip: Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!
Terrance: Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.
Phillip: She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!
Terrance: SICK!
Katie: Well what's the big deal? I've been queefing in this bed the entire time.
Phillip: Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.
Terrance: Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
Phillip: Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.
Randy: Alright son! Yeah!!
Stan: Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
Randy: Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.
Randy: There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
Randy, Stan: And realize we've been keeping women down.
Mr. Mackey: They have power and they have courage.
Stephen, Butters: And we must all stand by the belief.
Gerald, Kyle: That a woman is strong, and she has the right to queef.
The Males: Fly free. Free to queef aloud; fly free. Let every queef show that youre proud.
Randy: You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
The Males: You are woman now, and you are free to queef.
Cartman: It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
Mr. Garrison: They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.
Cartman: Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
Jimmy: Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week.
Jimmy: Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.
Jimmy: Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
Jimmy: ...So the Pope says, "What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?"
Cartman: Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
Cartman: Yeah, I like fishsticks.
Cartman: What, dude, you got something?
Jimmy: Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?
Cartman: Yeah.
Jimmy: You like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
Cartman: Yeah.
Jimmy: Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?
Butters: Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.
Jimmy: Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde.
Cartman: Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
Clyde: Hey.
Butters: Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
Cartman: Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?
Cartman: Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
Token: Yes.
Cartman: What are you?
Mr. Garrison: Hey, hey Mackey? Do you like fishsticks?
Mr. Mackey: Fishsticks? Yeah, I l- I like fishsticks, m'kay?
Stephen: Oh hey Peterson, buying fishsticks, I see.
Peterson: Yeah, I like fishsticks.
The Guys: Yes.
David Letterman: And so uhhh, hey Paul, do you like fishsticks, Paul?
Paul Shaffer: Uhhh, sure?
Anchor: It is quite possibly the funniest joke over conceived, and its origin is unknown. The fishsticks joke crosses all border, all races, all ages and ethnic groups and is slowly uniting our country. In fact, the only person who appears to not get the joke is rapper Kanye West, who becomes furious when people use the joke on him.
Kanye: Yo, that is messed up, yo! I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain't no fish! Alright?!
Tom Snyder: You. Really. Don't. Get it.
Kanye: Hey man, I'm a genius, alright?! I'm the most talented musician in the world! If I was a homosexual, or a fish, I would know!
Tom Snyder: You're a rapper.
Kanye: Yes.
Tom Snyder: An entrepreneur.
Kanye: Yes.
Tom Snyder: And you like fish dicks.
Kanye: Yes.
Tom Snyder: You're a gay fish.
Kanye: No! I am not no gay fish!
Tom Snyder: Just gay?
Kanye: I'm not gay and I'm not a fish! Man!
Kanye: Damn right I'm male.
Tom Snyder: A male that likes fish dicks.
Kanye: Yeah, I like fishsticks.
Tom Snyder: You like to put fish dicks in your mouth.
Kanye: Yeah.
Tom Snyder: You're a gay fish.
Cartman: And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
Kyle: We know, Cartman!
Cartman: Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
Jimmy: P-patent?
Cartman: Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
Jimmy: Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.
Kyle: Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
Jimmy: Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh...
Kyle: Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.
Jimmy: Actually it was potato chips.
Kyle: I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
Jimmy: W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room.
Craig: Then just give him half.
Kyle: What?
Craig: I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.
Kyle: Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
Craig: Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.
Kyle: No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"
Craig: Just give him half.
Doctor: He does not have gills.
Kanye: You hear that? No gills! So I can't be a fish. And I'm a genius voice of a generation so I'm not gay! So that is that! Alright?! It's over! Now are there any questions?
Reporter 1: Do you like fishsticks?
Kanye: Love 'em!
Conan O'Brien: Alright, recently... Recently we've all come to know the fishsticks joke as probably the funniest, most awesome joke ever, but who originally came up with it? Well here's your answer. Joining us tonight, the brains behind the incredible fishsticks joke, the one and only Carlos Mencia.
Conan O'Brien: So Carlos, you've got a show on Comedy Central, a stand-up tour, where did you have time to come up with this classic joke?
Jimmy: Really?
Cartman: Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
Jimmy: Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.
Cartman: But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!
Jimmy: Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.
Cartman: What?!
Jimmy: Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.
Cartman: Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
Cartman: Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?
Jimmy: Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'.
Cartman: Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
Sarah: Here's some fishsticks guys. I hope you like fishsticks.
Jimmy: Wow, thanks Eric.
Jimmy: Is that... Is that how it happened?
Cartman: Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
Jimmy: I'm... I'm sorry?
Announcer: Here he is, y'all! Give it up for Kanye West!
Audience: Gay fish! Gay fish! Gay fish!
Kanye: Just doesn't make any sense, yo. Why is everyone calling me a gay fish?
House: Kanye, look, we all think it would be better if you would just drop it. Ya-you know, I mean, ih-if you don't get it, you don't get it.
Aide 1: Kanye, really...
Kanye: I don't need anyone tellin' me "play on words"! I'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius!
Cartman: Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
Kyle: Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.
Kyle: You know what, Cartman? I believe you.
Cartman: You do?
Cartman: Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?
Jimmy: Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.
Jimmy: Hey, that'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.
Jimmy: Hey, you're really onto something there.
Sarah: Hello Eric. Have some chips, because you're totally not fat at all.
Jimmy: Right. And then I say, "Yeah."
Cartman: So then I can say, "What are you, a gay fish?"
Sarah: What is that?
Wendy: And he's not fat at all.
Cartman: Thanks you guys!
Cartman: Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.
Kanye: Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable, and fishsticks are crunchy?
Aide 2: Yo Kanye, KANYE! We found him money.
Kanye: Found who?
Aide 2: You told us to track down whoever started the whole fishstick thang. We found out who, dawg.
Kanye: You're just sayin' that now 'cause you're scared.
Mencia: No man it's truuue. I stole it maaan. I took credit for it 'cause I'm not actually funneee. Come on, maaan, do you know what it's like? Being a comedian but not being funneee? Come on, Kanye, I just take jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent, maaan.
Kanye: Think you can make fun of me? I'm a genius! I'm the voice of a generation! What are you?!
Mencia: Nothing! Look at me maaan. I'm not funny, I steal jokes, my dick don't work maaan. I got to piss in a plastic bag, man, I got no dick.
Kanye: I ain't gonna hurt you. I pay people to do that for me.
Mencia: 'Cause... 'cause you like fish dicks, man. Come on, maaan. Don't you get it? Please, just get it, maaan.
Ellen: So guys, I gotta ask: how did you come up with this incredible joke?
Jimmy: It was just a-
Cartman: Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
Ellen: But guys, this joke is so... perfect. Can you explain how nobody thought of it before?
Jimmy: Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-
Ellen: That's so great. And, and are you crying, Jimmy?
Cartman: Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
Jimmy: It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
Cartman: Yeah, that was kewl huh?
Jimmy: Eric, there's something I really need to know.
Cartman: Whassat?
Cartman: So... here it is.
Jimmy: How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
Jimmy: Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are.
Kanye: Aw right. Everyone knows who I am! I wanna know how this got started!
Jimmy: Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-
Cartman: Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!
Jimmy: Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-
Cartman: Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
Cartman: Hello Jim.
Jimmy: Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!
Jimmy: I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.
Cartman: Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
Wendy: You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman.
Jimmy: Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!
Cartman: Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
Jimmy: What?!
Cartman: You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
Jimmy: Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?
Cartman: Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
Kanye: What? I, I still don't get anything.
Cartman: All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
Jimmy: Rih, r-r-really?
Jimmy: Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding.
Aide 2: Yo Kanye! You sure about this?
Sharon: Hey guys, it's almost 2 a.m.
Sharon: Well it's way past time for bed.
Randy: Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!
Sharon: Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.
Stan: Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
Stan: What is that?
Randy: It's, uh it's nothing, really.
Reporter: Tom, I'm standing outside the Hadron particle super-collider in Switzerland, where authorities are shocked and baffled over the theft of a superconducting bending magnet created for use in tests with particle acceleration.
Stan: Tells?
Randy: When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.
Stan: Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
Official: Alright, car weighs in at 15 ounces. Do you hereby swear that you used parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit and only parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit?
Mr. Hollis: Well well, look son, it's the Marshes.
Randy: Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?
Randy: One point five?
Announcer: This is Nine News at Ten.
Agent Marx: Stan Marsh?
Stan: Yeah?
Agent Clark: Young man, what we are about to tell you is a matter of national security. Yesterday every country and embassy on Earth was contacted by... an alien life force.
Stan: Alien?
Stan: What does it want?
Agent Clark: We believe that they intend to welcome us into the Galactic Federation of Planets. They will want to meet the people who discovered warp speed for our species.
Stan: Dad they aren't here for that.
Agent Clark: Mr. Marsh, we were just telling your son that thanks to you, we have made first contact with alien life.
Agent Marx: NASA's confirmed that an alien ship has entered our solar system and it is headed here.
Randy: So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.
Randy: Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?
Randy: Hullo?
Britain: Godspeed, Mr. Marsh.
France: Ze nation of France iz with you.
Japan: Good ruck witha 'harien, Mista Marsh.
China: Prease say herro froma China.
Randy: That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.
Randy: He's got a gun!
Randy: What do you want?
Judge: Fine. He can build you what you want. All he needs is the official Pinewood Derby kit. Right Marsh?
Randy: Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.
McGee-zax: What's takin' so long?! You're stallin'!
Stephen: Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone.
Randy: Hello?
Italy: They justa blew up our government building! Ya got to hurry!
Britain: Mr. Marsh, why won't you finish the Pinewood Derby car?!
Randy: Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
Stan: Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.
McGee-zax: Aw zahts, it's the intergalactic police.
Officer 1: 'Scuse us, Earthlings, but uh, we've been in pursuit of a criminal from the Xenon galaxy. Fella by the name of Baby Fark McGee-zax?
Officer 1: Well, ya think anyone else on your planet might have seen him?
Randy: Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.
China: Uh uh no, no, we haven't seen arien.
France: Uh we've seen nothing here in France.
Randy: Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?
Officer 1: He stole over 600 parsohns of space cash from the universal bank. You're absolutely sure you didn't see an alien land here?
Randy: No, we're sure.
Officer 1: So then... we're the first aliens you've ever seen?
Randy: That's right, yep, you're the first ones.
Officer 1: You don't seem that excited about your first contact with alien life.
Randy: We will give you a call!
Officer 1: Huh.
Randy: Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.
Randy: Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!
Judge: That's true.
McGee-zax: I swear, if you don't have that thing workin' in three minutes this whole planet is done for!
Stan: Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
Randy: No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.
Randy: Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.
Stan: No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.
McGee-zax: What are you two whispering about, riiight?
Randy: Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.
Stan: I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
Randy: But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.
Stephen: Can you believe it?
General: Looks like those alien cops were right. Guess you should call them back now.
Stephen: Huh?
Stan: No, Dad-
Mr. Garrison: He's right. We don't have to call the police back.
Stan: Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?
Japan: Don't think you can keep the all the space cash for yourself!
Germany: That's right! This is all of our planet; the space cash belongs to all of us!
Australia: Either America shares that space cash with the rest of the world or we will tell the space cops!
Officer 1: Looks like the alien criminal did land here after all.
Randy: Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.
Officer 1: And so, did you find the missing space cash?
Officer 2: Well maybe someone else on your planet knows where it is?
Randy: Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?
Russia: No space cash.
Japan: No we haven't-
Britain: No space cash.
Brazil: No.
Randy: Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.
Officer 1: Uh huh. Guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet.
Randy: No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!
Japan: Well then why can Engrand build a nuclear power plant?!
Randy: Nobody can build anything!!
Britain: Yeah, well, it's not even gonna matter, because Finland is thinking about telling the space cops the truth!
Finland: We believe the aliens are going to find out sooner or later what we did. It's best we come clean now.
Finland: I'm sorry, but our nation is resolved. We cannot live with the guilt anymore.
Randy: All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.
China: Yep, we gotta take out Finrand, they gonna squeal.
Randy: Oh dammit!
Randy: Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?
Officer 1: Well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries? Uh, Finland?
Officer 2: It appears to have been... destroyed.
Crowd: Oh no, not Finland.
Randy: Hey guys, Finland's dead.
Russia: Oh no. No! Nooo.
Japan: Noo, not a Finrand!
Kenya: All of Finland, gone.
Randy: Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.
Officer 1: None of you knew anything about Finland's destruction?
Officer 2: We didn't say anything about nukes.
Randy: Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.
Randy: Stan?
Japan: Not in the approved kit?!
Australia: He cheated on the Pinewood Derby?
Randy: Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.
Officer 1: Your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words. You sure you Earthlings have nothing else to tell us?
Britain: Nope.
France: Nope.
South Korea: No changes.
Kenya: Nope.
Russia: No changes.
Brazil: Nope.
China: No. Tell them no.
Australia: No changes.
Britain: What the hell are they talking about?
Randy: It was... a trick?
Officer 2: Whenever a civilization discovers warp speed, we want to bring them into the Federation of Planets, but first we do the space cash test, to see if that species is worthy of joining.
Cartman: You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
Butters: We can?
Stan: What are you talking about, dude?
Clyde: Somalia? Where's that?
Cartman: North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
Kyle: Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
Kyle: No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
Cartman: Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
Kyle: Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
Kyle: Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
Kyle, Cartman: Jews can't be pirates.
Kevin: At my house? Why my house?
Cartman: There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!
Gordon: And for lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving taco salad or hoagie sandwiches. Thank you.
Clyde: Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.
Cartman: But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.
Cartman: Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!
Butters: Yeah!
Cartman: We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
Clyde: And your mom is okay with that?
Cartman: Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?
Butters: Neato!
Clyde, Ike: Pirates ho!
Cartman: We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!
Cartman: That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
Cartman: What?!
Butters: It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
Clyde: Yeah maybe we should think about this.
Cartman: You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
Butters: Huh, who, you mean you?
Cartman: Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
Butters: No, I'm sick of it!
Cartman: Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
Butters: He's right, lads. To adventure!
Clyde: This is Somalia?
Butters: Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
Somali 1: Burad. Iyaja dene zaredeko.
Somali 2: Buradi wakuwasa.
Pirate 1: "Is this some kind of joke?"
Pirate 2: "I don't know what the fuck this is!"
Cartman: I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with.
Pirate 1: "These white children will bring a high price in ransom money!"
Cartman: Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.
Pirate 3: "Get on board!"
Cartman: This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!
Pirate 3: "Get on the boat now!"
Pirate 4: "Move!"
Cartman: Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.
Cartman: Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!
Clyde: No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
French Captain: "Keep your eyes open, Mr. Leon. These waters are full of renegades and thieves."
French Captain: "They've got CHILDREN HOSTAGES!"
Cruise Attendant: "My God!"
French Captain: "Get the U.N. on the radio. Advise them of the situation."
Pirate 5: "We want 5,000 Euros! You easily have that much on board!"
Cartman: Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!
Butters: ARRRRRRGH!
Kyle: Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
Kyle: Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
Stan: You really think he'll die in Somalia?
Gerald: Take it easy. We'll find him.
Sheila: Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!
Kyle: What? Are you sure?
Sheila: He left a note saying he's never coming back.
Sheila: Oh Gerald, what are we gonna do?
Kyle: Oh God. What have I done?
Pirate 4: "We are growing impatient! Give us what we want or they die!"
Cartman: The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
French Captain: "Alright! Alright! We are going to give you what you want! But you must hand over the children UNHARMED!"
Cruise Attendant: "Did they hurt you?"
Cartman: Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!
French Captain: "What is this?!"
Cartman: Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!
Cartman: I said, get off my boat!
French Captain: "Scoundrels! You will pay for this!"
Cartman: Hard to port, lads!
Ike: I'm scared. There's a ghost.
Ike: But Daddy I saw the-
Sheila: Gerald, what has gotten into him?
Billy Mays: Hi, Billy Mays here for Megascrub Cleanser.
Ike: AAAAAAAAA!
Billy Mays: Are you tired of your kitchen counters getting those nasty stains? Don't just rub 'em, Megascrub 'em!
Ike: NOOOOO!
Dr. Land: Now Ike, your family is very worried about you. Ike, you can talk to me. I'm a therapist. Whatever has been troubling you, it's okay.
Ike: No, it's... it's a secret.
Dr. Land: Ike, tell me your secret. I promise not to tell anyone else.
Dr. Land: You mean, you see dead celebrities on TV? In the news?
Ike: I see them walking around. They talk to me.
Dr. Land: Are you seeing any dead celebrities right now?
Dr. Land: How often do you see dead celebrities?
Cartman: 'Sup, Jew?
Kyle: Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
Cartman: HA! What a dumbass!
Kenny: (What do you think is wrong with him?)
Kyle: I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.
Kyle: What?
Cartman: Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
Stan: Dude, I don't even know who that is.
Cartman: That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
Kyle: What?! Are you serious?!
Cartman: Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
Kyle: Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
Cartman: Because he was a great person, Kyle.
Kyle: NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
Cartman: ...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...
Jason: Alright, tell us what we got this week, Kris.
Kris: We're going to Colorado to investigate celebrity paranorm-
Jason: Wait, what? What was that? What was that?
Grant: I heard it too. It was like a, like a ...*pop*
Jason: Is there a ghost here?
Jason: Alright, so you say a little boy is seeing the ghosts?
Kris: Yeah, apparently only he is seeing them.
Jason: Doyuh ssh ssh. What, what is that? Do you hear that?! There, there look. What is that? What is that?
Grant: I think that's just a cigarette lighter.
Jason: Oh, right, okay. May be.
Jason: We are now inside the house where the celebrity ghosts have been spotted. Whoa whoa what? What was that? What was that?
Kyle: What was what?
Grant: I'm pretty sure that's their television.
Grant: I see it!
Jason: W... what is it?!
Jason: Look, it's starting to form a, a a pool around the floor now. Are you getting this??
Stan: Are you guys fucking serious?
Jason: Oh it smells!
TAPS: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Kyle: Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
Kyle: It's all just in your head, Ike.
Billy Mays: The fast and easy way to press and cook delicious sliders.
Kyle: I just... don't understand it.
Stan: It's gonna be alright, Kyle.
Cartman: Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
Stan: Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
Cartman: Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.
Dr. Carroll: Well boys, little Ike is stable, but the celebrity ghosts appear to have sent him into some kind of coma.
Stan: Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?
Kyle: Purgatory? What's that?
Billy Mays: Are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down?
Cartman: Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!
Walter Cronkite: No! Be quiet, Billy Mays! Somebody is trying to contact us!
Dr. Phillips: To which celebrity am I addressin' now?
Walter Cronkite: This, is Walter Cronkite.
Dr. Phillips: All you celebrities need to know that you have passed on.
Farrah Fawcett: We know that!
DJ AM: Yeah! Of course we know that!
Patrick Swayze: There's only one person here who's not cooperating!
Walter Cronkite: That's right! Now just admit you're dead and sit down!
Michael Jackson: ...No, that's ignorant! I'm not dead.
Stan: Uh oh.
Walter Cronkite: You are dead!
Michael Jackson: No, I just have a skin condition.
Dr. Phillips: Boys, quickly! Convince Michael Jackson that he's dead.
Kyle: What?
Dr. Phillips: He's in denial. He's been in denial all his life. Now tell him or you're gonna lose your little brother.
Kyle: Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
Michael Jackson: Nooo, you're being ignorant. I'm alive. And I'm a child. And I'm white.
Kyle: Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
Billy Mays: Hi, Billy Mays here for the Super Sweeper.
The Boys (except Cartman) and Dr. Phillips: Shut up, Billy Mays!
Stan: You're dead, Mr. Jackson!
Michael Jackson: No, that's, that's just ignorant.
Michael Jackson: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Kyle: Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
Kenny: (Holy shit, dude!)
Kyle: Hey! Heeey!
Ike: Come on, let's climb the tree! Hee hee!
Stan: Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
Kyle: Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
Cartman: Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
Kyle: What the hell are we going to do??
Ike: [still dancing] Jou know! Jou know it! Hee hee!
Ed McMahon: Come on, this is ridiculous! How much longer do we have to sit in purgatory?!
Passengers: Come on! Come on! This is ridiculous! Come on!
Passengers: AWWWWWWWW!
DJ AM: Yo, you can't just keep people stuck like this, man!
Flight Attendant: We know that you are all excited to cross over to the next plane, but for now you have to stay on this one.
Walter Cronkite: That's it! I have to go to the bathroom!
Flight Attendant: Sir, you have to stay in your seat with your seatbelt fastened!
Stan: Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...
Kenny: (No, scroll down some more, scroll down some more.)
Stan: ...setting traps for ghosts, no...
Kyle: So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
Kyle: Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
Cartman: Yes!
Kyle: And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
Stan: Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
Kyle: What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
Cartman: A child... and a female. And white.
Ike: Oh lookie, it's a planet. Hee hee hee.
Stan: So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
Brandy's Mom: Yeah Brandy! Work it girl!
MC: Brandy likes ice cream and playing with her cat Sunshine.
Cartman: Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
Stan: Yeahhhh!
MC: Michael says she just enjoys being a child. She loves to play and climb trees, and thinks people who don't are ignorant.
Ike: Ignorant.
Cartman: God I hope this works.
Billy Mays: Hi, Billy Mays here for the little Country Handy Pillow. Are you tired of sitting in limbo? Lost somewhere between planes of existence? Well now there's a product that can help you-
Walter Cronkite: Will somebody shut his fucking mouth?! I can't take it anymore!
Patrick Swayze: This is bad enough without having to constantly listen to you try and sell your stupid crap, Mays!
Billy Mays: With just two easy steps, I can climb over these seats and kick you right in the fucking balls!
David Carradine: That does it. We are not gonna just sit here anymore! We want some Goddamned answers!
Walter Cronkite: Why isn't anybody telling us anything?!
Pilot: Well ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking.
Walter Cronkite: Well it's about fucking time!
Pilot: Certainly want to uhhh thank you for all your patience. We know that you're eager to uhhhh get going and we will certainly pass on any information uhhhhh as it becomes uhhhhhh more available.
DJ AM: But yo! Yo Michael Jackson isn't even here anymore! He's gone! We should be able to move on now!
Flight Attendant: Yes, but as we all know, Mr. Jackson had a LOT of baggage, and he checked some of that baggage in, so a crew has to go through all the baggage and get his off of purgatory before we can push back from the gate.
Passengers: AWWWWWWWW!
Ike: Did I do good in the swimsuit category? I'm worried that little doodoohead brunette girl was prettier than me.
Kylie's Mom: It's more important for my little Kylie. Just look at this face.
Stan: Dude, the two male judges love her.
Kyle: Aww crap!
Cartman: Hey, what the F?!
MC: All right everyone, the judge will now tally her final scores.
Stan: Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
Heidi's Mom: You'll win for sure, Heidi. You know how much that judge adores you.
Kyle: Aw dude, this is hopeless!
Kenny: (Son of a fucking bitch!)
Cartman: Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
Cartman: What if you didn't have to give it up?
Lady Judge: Excuse me?
Cartman: I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.
Kyle: Yeah!
Cartman: Yeah!
Stan: Woohoo!
Ike: Kyle, what the fuck is going on?
Kyle: It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
Cartman: Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.
Farrah Fawcett: Hey he's here! He's here!
Bea Arthur: Oh, finally.
Others: He's here! He's back!
Billy Mays: Finally! Finally we can all move on!
Flight Attendant: All right, everyone, I'd like to be the first to welcome you to the gates of Hell. Unfortunately, Hell is a tow-in gate.
Passengers: AWWWWWWWW!
Cartman: Alright, your turn Craig.
Cartman: Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
Butters: Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.
Stan: Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
Butters: Uugh!
Kyle: So what?
Butters: Sellin' kisses?
Clyde: She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.
Butters: You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
Butters: Oh boy, I sure am nervous.
Cartman: Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
Kyle: Butters, I think you should reconsider this.
Butters: Uh, how come?
Kyle: Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
Cartman: Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
Butters: I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
Butters: Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
Jimmy: Go ahead, Bu-Butters. Go- go get some.
Butters: So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
Sally: Okay, cool.
Sally: So you got money?
Cartman: Atta boy Butters!
Tweek: You did it!
Jimmy: You're a man now! All right Butters good job!
Token: Good job, Butters!
Butters: Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
Butters: Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!
Sally: Jeez Butters, thanks for bringing me yet another customer. Here's your two dollar cut again.
Sally: Oh, that'd be great, but I can't do kisses before school. I have swimming class.
Sally: What?
Butters: Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
Butters: The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
Sally: Wow, that's a great idea, Butters.
Butters: Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
Sally: This is gonna be great!
Murphy: Sir! Sir, take a look at this. We've got rumors coming in of a possible "prostitution company" starting up in South Park.
Murphy: We've got no information on the prostitutes, don't know who they are or where they came from.
Murphy: Sting operation, sir?
Yates: Hey baby, you looking for a party?
Driver: Ha... how much are you charging?
Yates: Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra.
Driver: Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick.
Driver: Awhuh! What?!
Kyle: Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
Stan: Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
Butters: Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon? We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
Stan: Butters, you're the one doing all this?
Cartman: Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
Butters: I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
Butters: ...A pimp. Huh...
Butters: Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
Bishop: You? You be pimpin'?
Butters: Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
Butters: What's the game?
Pimp 2: See it's all about mind control. You gotta act a punk. Any man can control a bitch's heart, but a pimp gotta control a bitch's mind, know what I'm sayin'?
Butters: I know what you're saying.
Stephen: There you are, Butters!
Butters: Hey Dad!
Driver 2: I've got to tell you I... I don't do this kind of thing very often. You're sure you're not a cop, right?
Yates: No way! Let's just get to this, baby.
Driver 2: Alright.
Yates: So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?
Driver 2: Sure, I have the money right here.
Officer: Code word is "stretch," copy?
Yates: Oh yeah, yeah, get those pants down.
Driver 2: Oh, you feel good.
Yates: Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are.
Yates: Yeah, you like it?
Driver 2: Oh, I love it!
Yates: Yeah, you're a dirty fuck!
Yates: Yeah, come on! Harder! Deeper!
Yates: Yeah, teach me a lesson, daddy!
Yates: Teach this little whore a lesson!
Driver 2: Yeah! Yeah!
Yates: Yeah, that's right!
Driver 2: Oh God! It's the police!
Driver 2: Please! Please don't do this! I have a wife and kids!
Yates: A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street.
Butters: Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
Annie: So wait, you're keeping all the money now?
Mr. Garrison: Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.
Butters: Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?
Butters: Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
Bebe: Shut up!
Wendy: Leave me alone.
Butters: Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
Stan: Butters. Dude!
Butters: What?
Stan: You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!
Wendy: Stan!
Stan: Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
Cartman: Dude, we've created a monster.
Butters: Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
Mr. Garrison: Butters! Butters, do you have a problem?!
Butters: All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
Kyle: Butters, I really think we should talk.
Butters: Sure, Kyle.
Kyle: Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
Kyle: Butters, what's happened to you?
Frat Boys: Eewwww!
Murphy: Sir, sssome of us are wwwondering if maybe y-you're not... taking this role a bit far?
Yates: Ye-yes, Daddy, I'm on my way.
Bishop: I made you my bottom bitch, now you gotta take care of yo' pimp, know what I'm sayin'?
Black Bitch: Damn bitch! Yo' pimp beat yo' ass again?
White Bitch: He's an asshole.
Black Bitch: You know, I heard a rumor about some new pimp up in Park County. They say he's real respectful; lots of girls switching over to him.
Charise: Did I do good, Daddy?
Butters: And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
Receptionist: And exactly what kind of business are you running?
Butters: It's a kissing company.
Receptionist: And you're making a profit?
Butters: 'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
Receptionist: Senator Morris?
Butters: Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
Receptionist: Where?
Butters: In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
Butters: Huh? Why?
Receptionist: I'm not falling for it!
Butters: But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
Boss: Mrs. Davis, is there some kind of problem?
Receptionist: Eh no sir.
Butters: Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
Sally: Okay.
Charise: Ubup. Daddy, how come this ho get to be bottom bitch?
Sally: What?
Charise: I make the most money for you Daddy, that means if anyone should be bottom bitch, it's me.
Charise: Fair is fair, ho.
Butters: Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
Yates: Well, I think that's about all I need to hear.
Butters: What's that?
Yates: You've got a lot of nerve coming here, Keshawn! After the way you treated me? I need a pimp that doesn't beat me every time he gets drunk!
Butters: Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
Butters: Wha? Awww.
Bishop: I love you so much.
Yates: Babe, I love you too.
Bishop: So much, baby.
Yates: Let's, uh, let's just be happy okay?
Bishop: Promise, babe. Promise.
Yates: I love 'em, darling.
Bishop: I wanted to get you something extra-special.
John Cena: Say that again, Edge! You think you're better than me?!
Edge: Cena, your mouth has gotten you in trouble for the last time! I'm gonna shut it up for you!
Spectators: Oooooooooooooooooooooo!
Darryl: Mess him up, Edge!
Obese Woman: Kick his ass! WOO!
Cartman: Oh my God, dude, this is sooo awesome!
Stan: I'm having the best time!
Darryl: He took his job!
Redneck 2: He took his jrrr?
Butters: Yes! Yehhehehes!
Cartman: This is awesome!
Cartman: Dude! That was so badass!
Kyle: Wrestling is awesome!
Cartman: The fuck is this?!
Kyle: Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
Butters: Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.
Kyle: Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
Kyle: Cool!
Stan: Yeah!
Butters: Let's do this!
Cartman: All right!
Coach: Now, the first thing we're gonna learn today are the fundamental wrassling holds. Let's get some volunteers. Uh why don't come over here young man? What's your name?
Cartman: The Rad Russian.
Coach: What?
Cartman: You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
Coach: Okay uh, just go ahead and get on your hands and knees.
Cartman: Huh?
Cartman: Okay...
Coach: Alright and now how about you. Your name is?
Butters: Triceratops!
Cartman: The fuck is this?!
Coach: Now just reach around him here. Good.
Coach: Get back on the floor! I'm teaching the starting position of wrassling!
Cartman: That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
Stan: Yeah, what are you? A child molester?
Kyle: Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
Coach: Oh, not this again! Let me guess: you just went to that stupid WWE show in Denver last night!
Stan: Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
Coach: Rrrgh!
Cartman: The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say "You slept with my girlfriend," and I'll charge you into a head slap.
Jimmy: Sounds good.
Cartman: Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like "No no, the fight hasn't started yet," and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
Butters: Okey doke.
Jimmy: So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
Cartman: Noo, let's save the "girlfriend is a whore" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
Butters: Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!
Cartman: Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
Stan: Yup.
Jimmy: I am gonna k-kick your ass!
Butters: Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
Jimmy: Your girlfriend is a whore!
Token: You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw!
Stan: We'll see about that!
Redneck 4: What's goin' on?
Redneck 5: Apparently that crippled kid slept with that Russian kid's girlfriend.
Redneck 4: Jeez they're so young.
Kyle: I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
Butters: That's because your mother betrayed my mother, Juggernaut!
Stan: You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
Cartman: And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
Stan: I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
Redneck 6: That kid was in 'Nam? Man, that's incredible!
Redneck 7: Good for you for serving your country!
Redneck 8: Guys, check this out! There's this little kid from the Congo, who was raised by panthers!
Redneck 9: Are you serious?
Kyle: Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
Token: I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!
Redneck 10: That kid in the hat is havin' sex with two different girls?
Redneck 11: Naw, that little kid from the Congo lied about one of them to try and get the kid in the hat in trouble with his wife.
Redneck 12: They're married?
Jimmy: You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back!
Cartman: I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
Redneck 9: That Russian kid's got hepatitis?
Jimmy: What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?
Kenny: (I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)
Kyle: Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
Stan: You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
Kyle: If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
Cartman: Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
Stan: What?!
Redneck 13: No! No! What are you doing?! Stan the Man loves you!
Redneck 14: Don't break his heart!
Stan: If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
Kyle: Irene, no! Why?
Cartman: Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
Redneck 15: Whoa, did you hear that?
Redneck 16: Shh!
Stan: Irene, you said you loved me!
Darryl: I'm telling you guys, you've got to see this. These kids ain't more than eight or nine years old an' they got more problems than you can imagine.
Redneck 13: There's this one kid, he saw his father get murdered. And yesterday he finds the killer, and it's this other kid whose an ex-cop. Needless to say, he whupped his ass good.
Darryl: Yup, and there's this little girl, she's actually addicted to gettin' abortions. Got pregnant by nearly every boy there.
Redneck 17: You're shittin' me!
Darryl: You can watch 'em almost every afternoon. It's some of the greatest wrestlin' we ever seen.
Coach: It's all made up! Fiction! Real wrassling is a serious and respectable sport! Why can't you people understand that that kind of wrestling isn't real?!
Darryl: Mister, you'd better take your gay porn an' walk right out of this bar.
Stan: Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
Kyle: Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
Butters: Yeah!
Kyle: Let's do this! One! Two!
Boys: Backyard wrestling!
Cartman: Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.
Stan: Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
Redneck 13: Gee, I didn't know his parents did that.
Redneck 18: Shhh.
Principal Victoria: I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.
Coach: You're firing me? Why?!
Coach: No, this isn't wrassling! THIS ISN'T WRASSLING! Principal Victoria, just let me stay on and I can teach kids what real wrassling is!
Principal Victoria: I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.
Coach: You can't fire me for what these kids do!
Principal Victoria: That isn't the only reason you're being let go.
Coach: What do you mean?
Token: Oh! Sure, that works.
Cartman: We just received a letter from the WWE.
Stan: From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
Butters: No way!
Cartman: "Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling organization and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."
Stan: Vince McMahon is coming to see us?
Stan: Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
Kyle: Oh my God... Oh my God...
Token: I can't believe it's him.
Butters: I'm freaking out...
Cartman: Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
Stan: Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
Darryl: Yeah, no I I think Congo is a great wrestler; I just think Rad Russian has his number.
Darryl: Uh oh, it looks like the intermission is over, better head back.
Butters: Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
Kyle: I'll fight anytime, anywhere!
Cartman: Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
Kyle: Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
Cartman: Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
Kenny: (Yeah, we've been talking.)
Cartman: And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
Stan: Yeah?
Cartman: Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.
Kenny: (Yep.)
Kyle: What are you talking about?
Stan: He's right.
Kyle: What?
Stan: Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
Cartman: Right?
Stan: And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
Kyle: Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
Cartman: No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.
Cartman: Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
Kyle: So what do we do?
Kenny: (We've gotta bring somebody else on.)
Cartman: Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
Stan: Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
Kyle: How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
Cartman: It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
Kyle: That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
Kenny: (Mhm.)
Stan: Yeah yeah, not bad.
Stan: Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.
Cartman: Yeah, this guy crushes.
Jimmy: Oowow, it's really him.
Stan: Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?
Kyle: You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
Stan: Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
Kyle: Wait a minute. Who is that?
Kyle: You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!
Cartman: My man can do whatever he wants.
Mr. Conners: Stay calm, you know what you have to do.
Cartman: You're just gonna have to deal with that.
Butters: No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
Cartman: My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
Stan: No, you can't possibly mean that-!
Cartman: Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
Crowd: Awwwww!
Redneck 21: He's alive!
Cartman: You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
Assistant: What do you think?
Stan: Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you do something informal like that.
Jimmy: Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!
Butters: Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
Cartman: O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
Stan: When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
Butters: He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
Kenny: (I can keep the baby...)
Fan 1: O dios mio, mataron al Pollo Loco!
Redneck 22: We want some real wrestlers!
Darryl: What the hell do you care?! Get off the wrestlin' mat! Boo!
Mr. Conners: Why do I care? These kids made it so real wrassling is gone from schools! It's practically gone from the culture. Damn it they took my job!
Redneck 5: They took his job.
Darryl: Oh man, they took his job?
Redneck 13: They took hid-drr.
Mr. Conners: Lost everything! Couldn't even afford to pay for my... little retriever Rex anymore! Animal Control came and got him!
Redneck 24: They took his dog!
Redneck 25: They tok hid-drr!
Redneck 5: Took hid-drrr!
Mr. Conners: I ended up on the streets, stealing! Got busted by the police and had to spend the night in jail! The other inmates, they all beat me up and fractured my jaw to where I couldn't eat!
Redneck 26: They broke his jaw!
Redneck 22: Theeyy broke his jaw!
Vince: Sir, that was one of the finest wrestling performances I have ever seen.
Mr. Conners: What?
Vince: Will you not join our wrestling organization? I promise to make you our leading act.
Mr. Conners: You, you mean it?
Kyle: What?
Stan: Dude.
Vince: Sorry boys. You are decent wrestlers, but lack the raw wrestling talent this man has.
The Boys: Aaaaah.
Cartman: This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
Kyle: Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
Jimmy: Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!
Jimmy: You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!
Redneck 28: What the hell's this?
Redneck 29: This is Goddamned fake!
Cartman: Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!
Redneck 30: FAKE!
Cartman: Kenny! I'm-
Randy: Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?
Stan: Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
Chet: If they come near you you can touch their back just no grabbing please. What whimsical creatures aren't they? All the dolphins you will be encountering today are Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Now who would like to get a kiss from one?
Girl: I would like to-
Japanese Man 1: (In Japanese Accent) Fuck youuu dofiiin!
Japanese Man 3: (In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, whaaales!
Jessica: AAAAAAAA!
Stan: Dad, why did they do that?
Japanese Man 5: (In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, dofiiin!
Cartman: What do you mean? This song is sweet.
Stan: No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
Kyle: Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
Stan: So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something.
Kyle: What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
Stan: It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
Cartman: I'm not too busy, Stan.
Stan: You're not?
Cartman: No, I just don't care. At all.
Kenny: (Yeah, me neither.)
Stan: Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
Butters: Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
Butters: Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
Butters: I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
Singer: The world is a vampire, sent to drain.
Captain Paul Watson: Yeah, we're badass.
Singer: Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
Japanese Sailor: Fuck youuu, weiruu!
First Mate: Oh my God, they're gonna kill those humpbacks!
Woman: We've gotta do something!
Captain: Pull up next to them. The fight is on!
Crew: Yeah!
Stan: Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!
Captain: Are we badasses?
Crew, Stan: Yeah!
Captain: Are we badasses?
Crew, Stan: Yeah!
Woman: "Oh my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales."
Captain: Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis?
Stan: Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
Captain: Why not?
Stan: Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
Luke: Haha, you stink now! Haha!
Stan: Wait, that's it?
Captain: Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one.
Stan: Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
Captain: Well no, that'd be illegal.
Crewman 2: Yeah.
Woman: I'm a pirate in a war.
Stan: Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
Captain: We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!
Crewman: Paul?
Crewman 2: What do we do?
Woman: We don't have a captain!
Crewman: Oh my God, oh my God!
Crewman 2: Oh my God.
Luke: What did you do?
Announcer: And now, Larry King, live.
Larry King: My guest tonight is the little boy who took over the Whale Wars reality show and turned it into a big hit. Please welcome Stan Marsh and his crew.
Luke: 'Ey Jordan! I'm on Larry King, mate!
Larry King: So Stan, what motivated you, what... inspired you to get out there and make a hit TV show?
Stan: No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.
Larry King: Once you became captain the methods used to stop the Japanese definitely became more aggressive. Was that the key to help boost your ratings?
Stan: ...No, I don't care about the show.
Woman 2: We're pirates.
Stan: I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls!
Sid: Larry, you can't just go out and take matters into your own hands like this. If you want a hit TV show you have to go through producers, directors, people that are in unions.
Larry King: But Sid, you saw the show before Stan took it over; you have to admit that it was nothing but incompetent vegan pussies doing absolutely nothing and trying to turn it into drama.
Sid: Yes, but it doesn't justify changing the entire show structure that their old captain had pitched to the network.
Stan: Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
Sid: He yes, of course, everyone knows that Paul Watson was a smug, narcoleptic liar with no credibility, but we must-
Stan: Screw this, I gotta get back to work!
Stan: Would you mind stepping back a little?
Stan: No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
Stan: Oh no, no, NO.
Cartman: What dude?
Stan: Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
Cartman: We always have.
Kenny: (Yeah, totally!)
Stan: I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
Cartman: That's not what we said.
Stan: You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"
Cartman: We were talking about Wales the country.
Stan: Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!
Kenny: (I just want to be on TV.)
Crewman 2: Captain! Captain, the Japanese have been spotted near buoy 24!
Stan: Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
Crewman 2: What the hell was that?!
Crewman 3: We just got rammed.
Stan: Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
Crewman 4: It's not the Japanese.
Announcer: On deck the crew is surprised at what they see. The other boat is from Deadliest Catch, a crab-fishing reality show.
Stan: What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
DC Captain: You're taking viewers away from our show, you stupid ass!
Cartman: Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!
DC Crewman: Your show is fuckin' gay!
Stan: Dude, fuck you!
DC Captain: Fuck you!
Benjamin: Captain, look!
Woman 2: The whales are taking out the crab fisherman reality show!
Stan: They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
Stan: Will you stop that?
Cartman: Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
Stan: Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
Emperor Akihito: So, you are the ones who have been-a sinking our boats!
Stan: You speak English.
Emperor Akihito: You have caused us many problems, set us back many months!
Cartman: Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
Kenny: (Yeah, can we go?)
Stan: Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
Cartman: What dude?
Stan: Ummm, where did you get that picture?
Emperor Akihito: The Americans were nice enough to give it to us the day after the bombing. We were so-a thankful for the picture that the next day we ended our war with America. We will never forgive, never rest until they are all wiped out! Fuck you. Fuck you dohfin and-a weiru!
Cartman: So that's what this has all been about?
Stan: Dude, it wasn't actually and dolphin and a whale who bombed Hiroshima. It was the-
Stan: Oh, right. Look, I... I think I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
Kyle: Hello? Stan?
Stan: Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
Emperor Akihito: Chicken and-a cow? Chicken and-a cow?!
The Japanese: Fuck you cows!
The Japanese: Teikara chickens!
Cartman: Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
Stan: Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
Kyle: This... is exactly what I needed.
Stan: God! Shut up!
Randy: Isn't this great food?
Gerald: You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.
Lead Biker: Everybody's checking us out.
Biker 2: Yeah, they think we're pretty cool.
Lead Biker: Hooo! We were definitely turnin' some heads out there.
Biker 3: Yeah!
Biker 2: I was pullin' back on that throttle, and everybody was like, "What is that?"
Biker 4: Fer sure!
Biker 3: Yeah.
Biker 5: Hey- hey, nobody here is really paying attention to us.
Lead Biker: ...What did you say?
Cartman: You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
Biker 6: ...Hey man, we roll how we roll, and if people are annoyed or intimidated by it, that's too bad for them!
Biker 7: Thah- that little boy just called us fags.
Biker 2: Like he didn't think we were cool.
Biker 6: But he's wrong. People don't think we're fags, do they?
Lead Biker: 'Course he's wrong! And anyway, nobody except that little freak would ever say something like it to our faces!
Biker 2: Did that kid just call us-?
Biker 4: It doesn't make any sense. They all called us fags.
Lead Biker: I know, I know! Look, guys, I think I know what the problem is here.
Biker 3: Really? You do?
Biker 9: Whatwhat?
Lead Biker: Yeah, think about it, guys. You see all the things kids have today? I mean, with their Xboxes and surround-sound entertainment systems, kids today are surrounded by big loud stuff all the time!
Biker 10: Hey, that's right.
Kyle: Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
Biker 6: Chicken spears! Chicken spears! Chicken spears! ...Chicken spears! Chicken spears!
Stan: God damn it God damn it!
Biker 2: Let's see 'em call us fags now!
Stan: All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
Kyle: Yes.
Cartman: Agreed.
Jimmy: I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots.
Kyle: Sounds good.
Jimmy: Okay good, yeah.
Cartman: Ni-nice, okay.
Butters: What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
Cartman: What?
Butters: I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
Stan: ...That makes perfect sense, Butters.
Butters: It does?
Stan: Yes, now get out of here.
Stan: Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
Cartman: I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
Stan: But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
Cartman: I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
Stan: Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
All: Yeah!
Lead Biker: Now that was a good breakfast.
Biker 6: Ohh, OHHH! Somebody took a shit on mah fuckin' Harley!
Biker 3: What?
Biker 7: There's little flags stuck in the shit!
Biker 11: You've gotta be kidding me!
Stan: Really nice work, guys.
Kyle: Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
Big Gay Al: And so I said to the guy, "you really think I'm paying that much?"
Big Gay Al: I thought we were past this.
Mayor McDaniels: Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, "Fags get out." Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-
Cartman: That was us!
Mayor McDaniels: ...'Scuse me?
Stan: Yeah, we did that!
Kyle, Kenny: Yeah!
Mayor McDaniels: ...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!
Kyle: W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of our town.
Cartman: Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?
Mr. Mackey: Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!
Stan: Gay people?
Kyle: We aren't talking about gay people.
Mr. Mackey: You just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town!
Stan: Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
Cartman: Oh, they think we meant gay fags.
Kyle: Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
Mayor McDaniels: What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!
Stan: Aw crap!
Lead Biker: Faggot, often shortened to fag, has been used in the English language since the late sixteenth century. Its original meaning was "an old or unpleasant woman".
Biker 2: That certainly don't apply to us.
Lead Biker: Faggot later was defined as a bundle of sticks. And in the nineteenth century, a faggot gatherer was someone who made a meager living gathering firewood.
Biker 2: What's that part say there?
Lead Biker: Later, the term "fag" was defined as any awkward bundle to be carried, and was often used as an insult to the elderly, as in calling them "baggage".
Biker 2: Fag was used as an insult to women, then poor people, then old people?
Lead Biker: In the early 1900s the word became a pe-jo-ra-tive term against homosexuals and transgender people in the United States.
Judge 1: We are really trying to understand this. How is it that you boys think referring to gay people as fags in today's world is acceptable?
Stan: Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.
Judge 2: I happen to be gay, boys. Do you think I'm a fag?
Stan: Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
Judge 2: No.
Stan: Then you're not a fag.
Judge 1: So what if a guy is gay and rides a Harley?
Cartman: Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
Stan: I don't know.
Kenny: (This is fucking ridiculous.)
Stan: All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
Judge 3: "Fag."
Stan: Right. But you're not thinkin' "Oh, he's a homosexual," you're thinkin' "Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."
Judge 1: This, this is, making insanely good sense to me.
Judge 4: Alright, how about this: What would you call a straight man who doesn't own a Harley, but likes them and might buy one someday?
Cartman: You call them "bike-curious".
Judge 1: "Bike-cu-"
Stan: "Bike-curious"! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
Big Gay Al: Fellow homosexuals, I believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind. We must acknowledge that the words "fag" and "faggot" are never going to disappear. They're simply too much fun for everyone to say. But we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet, and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot Harley riders!
Big Gay Al: We should all be tolerant, but not with these fucking people! They really are faggots!
Mr. Slave: Yes Jesus yes!
Announcer: This is Channel 4 Evening News.
News Anchor: A new movement in South Park is bringing to question the word "fag". Gay groups are pointing out that the word no longer means to kids today what it meant just a few years ago.
Field Reporter: And what is your name, little boy?
Martin: Martin.
Lead Biker: What did you say?
Field Reporter: Just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance, fag.
Lead Biker: Hey you know what? If you call me fag in my face one more time, you'd better-
Field Reporter: I already did it twice.
Lead Biker: Well I think that- I think that you uh, you probably won't say it again.
Field Reporter: I bet I do.
Lead Biker: Well okay, I-
News Anchor: ...more and more Harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere.
Stan: Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
Kyle: I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
Another Mayor: The fact of the matter is that "fag" is still defined in the dictionary as a pejorative term against homosexuals, and so you are still causing harm to gay people everywhere whether you mean it differently or not! The town of South Park and its mayor have once again shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the progressive world!
Mayor McDaniels: She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!
Kyle: We're sorry, Mayor.
Mayor McDaniels: Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!
Stan: We can fix this!
Mayor McDaniels: HOW?!
Stan: That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
Cartman: Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
Field Reporter: Excitement is in the air as the citizens of South Park amass to see if the word "fag" will officially be changed in the English dictionary. Four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor, and if they succeed, "fag" will officially refer to Harley riders nationwide.
Big Gay Al: You can do it, boys! We believe in you!
Cartman: Emmanuel Lewis, huh?
Stan: There's fags everywhere!
Kyle: Yeah. You definitely made your point.
Biker 13: No! We rolled in, kicked ass, and took shit over! Is that what a fag does?!
Stan: Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
Lead Biker: No, you're supposed to think we're not fags now!
Stan: But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
Kyle: I don't either.
Biker 14: Who is this little fag?
Butters: I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
Biker 15: That's it, let's kill them all!
Cartman: No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
Biker 2: Yeah, we like being fags.
Lead Biker: So go ahead, America. Whenever you pass by Harley riders like us, roll down your window, and yell "Faggots!" All you kids out there, when you see us, walk up to us, and say "Hello, fags." No, really, we want you to. At least we're cool enough to embrace who we are. Right guys?
Stan: ...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
Stan: We did it! Yeah!
Stan: Today, we've made history.
Gordon: Who are you?!
Intruder: I'm the man who's gonna put a bullet between your eyes!
Gordon: Hey! He's got a gun!
Intruder: You little bastard! You fucked my wife! You think I wouldn't find out?!
Gordon: Sir, please, I don't know you.
Intruder: Yeah, right!
Gordon: Oh God, he shot him!
Intruder: Ya had to push me, didn't ya?! NOW YOU!
Intruder: There! How's it feel, huh?!
Intruder: You're Gordon Stoltski, right?! Truck driver from Chicago?!
Gordon: No, I'm Gordon Stoltski, third grader who reads the morning announcements!
Intruder: Yeah, right! We'll see if that's true. Go on, read the morning announcements!
Gordon: SOMEBODY HELP ME!
Intruder: I knew you were lyin'! That was terrible! Now put your mouth over the barrel of this gun!
Intruder: DO IT!
Mr. Mackey: We will always remember the way that Gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the Pledge of Allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. And even though we now know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, I know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. But now we must decide who will pick up where little Gordon left off. Who will take his place reading the morning announcements? It's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? And although Gordon Stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning.
Cartman: Oh. My. Goodddd.
Cartman: Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
Mike: Yeah, I think it would be really fu-fu-fu-fun, and ru-ru-ru-rurrraise my self es-es-esesesteem.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, really nice, Mike, uh, maybe next time you can get past the first word. Oh, Casey Miller, good, you're trying out too?
Casey: I'm tryin' out and dryin' out in the sultry summer sun that is my voice.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay Eric, I'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.
Cartman: Mr. Mackey, what's a moronic jizzrag?
Mr. Mackey: What? What on earth are you askin' me that for?!
Mr. Mackey: Get lost, you little dirtball!
Casey: Excuse me?
Mr. Mackey: I said take a hike!
Casey: I don't understand... what I did wrong.
Butters: Oh jeez!
Cartman: But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
Kyle: Will somebody shut him up?
Cartman: You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
Principal Victoria: The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.
Cartman: Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
Principal Victoria: No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.
Cartman: Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
Mr. Mackey: Well, because he was being murdered.
Cartman: You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
Principal Victoria: All we ask is you keep it shorter.
Cartman: Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
Third Graders: I pledge allegiance to the flag -
Cartman: - of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
Kindergartners: - a socialist dunghole...
Butters: Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?
Wendy: Is what true?
Butters: That you hate Smurfs?
Wendy: I don't have time for this.
Butters: Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
Wendy: Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
Melvin 1: Oh my God!
Melvin 2: Yeah, bemememe!
Melvin 3: Oh my God!
Butters: What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
Casey: Hyeah.
Melvin 1: That was cool.
Melvin 4: Awesome.
Melvin 2: Yeah, that was cool.
Melvin 3: Yeah, great job.
Cartman: "Thank you" and this is to..?
Douglas: Douglas.
Butters: Hey Eric!
Butters: Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
Cartman: Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
Butters: Cool, thanks.
Cartman: That'll be five dollars.
Stan: What the hell do you think you're doing?!
Cartman: A book signing.
Stan: I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
Cartman: I do not directly say she's a slut!
Stan: "Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"!
Stan: "Or does she?"
Cartman: "Or does she?" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
Stan: Hey hey, stop reading that!
Boy 1: Wull what do you mean?
Stan: Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
Boy 2: Yes it does!
Stan: Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
Wendy: I really don't care, Stan.
Stan: Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
Cartman: You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
Principal Victoria: Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.
Cartman: Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
Mr. Mackey: Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?
Cartman: And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
Mr. Mackey: Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-
Cartman: Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
Cartman Smurf: Wendy, what are you doing here?!
Human Wendy: Smurfberries are worth a lot of money. With all those Smurfberries I can power the school for the entire year.
Cartman Smurf: Wendy, I know you're president of our school, but you can't just dig up the Smurfs' land!
Cartman Smurf: How many Smurfberries is enough, Wendy?!
Cartman Smurf: Smurfette noooo!
Human Wendy: Suck mah fat tits!
Butters: That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
A Melvin: I can no longer stand idly by.
Butters: We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
Casey: It is time for that slutty Smurf-killing bitch to get what's comin' to 'er.
Melvins: Yeah!
Butters: Let us not forget what happens this day!
A Melvin: Do it!
Melvin 2: Take that, school president!
Melvin 3: Get her good!
Butters: I am.
Butters: The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
Wendy: It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.
Cartman: Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
Wendy: Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house.
Cartman: People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
Wendy: If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?
Cartman: Of course. That's why we're here.
Wendy: Sure.
Cartman: Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
Wendy: Okay.
Wendy: I don't, I, I have no idea what-
Cartman: You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
Butters: Ohhh, he's got her now!
Cartman: Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
Wendy: I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-
Butters: She's speechless!
Cartman: You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
Wendy: Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.
Cartman: Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?
Wendy: What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?
Cartman: What? What do you mean I know that?
Wendy: I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?
Cartman: No! You wiped them all out!
Cartman: Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
Wendy: No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.
Stan: What?!
Wendy: And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.
Butters: All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
A Melvin: I'm confused.
Cartman: No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
Wendy: Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.
Cartman: You sold the movie rights to who?!
Wendy: James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.
Cartman: Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
Cartman: Huh!
Stan: Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
Cartman: No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
Kyle: Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
Casey: The sun is up and the birds are chirping. I'm Casey Miller and these, are the morning announcements. I have a letter from second-grade student Brian Falner. Brian writes, "Dear Casey, why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead? My desk is broken, and so far Eric Cartman has done nothing about it. Will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy?" Well Brian, I couldn't agree more. Our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake.
Cartman: This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
Butters: What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
Cartman: No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
Jimmy: W-What are you talking about, Eric?
Cartman: You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
Randy: I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at 4:00, you got it?
Cartman: Come on, let's go!
Stan: We got it, Dad.
Kyle: All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
Stan: Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
Stan: Dude, this is awesome.
Kyle: You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
Kyle: I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
Stan: Okay.
Butters: You said "go ahead".
Stan: Come on Kyle, let's check out the fireboats.
Kyle: No dude, Butters' pee is in there.
Stan: Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
Butters: Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
Kyle: No they don't!
Stan: Yeah, they do, Kyle.
Jimmy: To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tu-tu-twenty five seconds ago.
Kyle: Dude!
Stan: Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
Kyle: NO!
Ride Operator: Guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-
Cartman: Just do it in English!
Stan: After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
Butters: You bet!
Kyle: I'm not getting back in the water.
Stan: Aw come on, Kyle.
Kyle: Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
Stan: Not everybody pees in pools.
Kyle: Do you pee in the pool?
Stan: Not today... yet.
Kyle: Aw, come on!
Stan: Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
Kyle: Most likely.
Stan: Dude, where have you been?
Cartman: I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? And there are a hundred and ninety black people!
Kyle: So what?
Cartman: So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
Kyle: Well then they're not minorities, are they?
Cartman: ...What do you mean?
Kyle: Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
Cartman: The black and brown people.
Cartman: Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's a fifty percent rise in one, year!
Stan: This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
Cartman: Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
Butters: The who?
Cartman: The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
Stan: I'm gonna go on the slides.
Woman: Eugene, that is disgusting! Did you just pee in the pool?
Eugene: Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything.
Water Tester: Oh my God.
Pi-Pi: Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi-Pi. How can I help you?
Assistant: Pi-Pi, we have some dire news concerning your water park.
Water Tester: I've just finished some tests. The water in your park is now 98% pee.
Pi-Pi: Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?
Pi-Pi: What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggest-a weekend. Everyone is having a-theh fun.
Lawyer: And what proof... do you have that the pee levels will go up?
Water Tester: One in three people admit they pee in pools. Add another for people who do but don't admit it; that's two in three. You've got just over five hundred people out there; that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water!
Water Tester: You have to evacuate people now!
Lawyer: He said he's not doing it! And as his lawyer I advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you!
Butters: Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
Woman Who Loses Baby: (shrieks)
Randy: What's going on?
Fire Marshal: I told you people to keep civilians back!
Randy: Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?
Fire Marshal: We don't know yet, all right?! There's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead. Now I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to-
Water Tester: We warned the owner of the park, but he refused to shut down. This was inevitable.
Fire Marshal: So this is all pee-related.
Water Tester: Yes, I... tested the pH levels this morning.
Fire Marshal: And?
Water Tester: It was almost all pee, no H.
Fire Marshal: Stay BACK!
Randy: You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
Officer 2: Sir, it's possible with a crane we could help any survivors out.
Water Tester: I think that would be a very bad idea.
Fire Marshal: And why is that?
Water Tester: Anyone inside there is contaminated. We have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee, they... change.
Fireman 1: Change how?
Fire Marshal: My God! He's become full of rage!
Kyle: Aahhh...
Kyle: No way!
Jimmy: You've gotta swim over here, Kyle.
Butters: Come on, Kyle!
Kyle: Dude, that's all pee!
Stan: Well if you don't swim in it you're gonna die!
Kyle: I'll die if I do swim in it!
Stan: Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
Kyle: Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
Kyle: WHAT?
Stan: Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.
Kyle: You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
Stan: Not... all the time.
Kyle: That is gross!!
Stan: Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
Stan: Kyle, come on!
Butters: Do you need to wash your hands?
Cartman: Help! Help!
Man 2: Are you okay?
Cartman: Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
Man 2: Well what are we gonna do now?
Woman 1: We've gotta just wait it out.
Woman 2: Yeah, but for how long?
Man 3: We need to find somethin' to paddle with.
Sharon: Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.
Randy: It's the pee! It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!
Sharon: What is all pee?
Randy: Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.
Sharon: What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!
Randy: I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.
Sharon: Randy, you've got to do something!
Fire Marshal: They're still angry.
Kyle: Dude, why the hell aren't people coming to help us?
Stan: Who are you?
Pi-Pi: But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi-Pi. In-a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open it, all this pee can be lowered.
Jimmy: Okay. W-where's the maintenance room?
Kyle: No!
Butters: You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
Kyle: Not in pee!
Kyle: You don't pee in the shower, dude. That's fucking disgusting!
Pi-Pi: Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!
Kyle: Jesus Christ!
Teacher: Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!
Cartman: ...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
Teacher: Good.
Seor Lopez: You don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?
Cartman: Well, I do just as much work.
Councilman: All those in favor of putting white people in camps?
Audience: Aye!
Councilman: All those opposed?
Cartman: Noooo...
Pi-Pi: Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi-Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface.
Kyle: Let's just get this over with!
Pi-Pi: You've got-a the map and-a Pi-Pi's instructions?
Kyle: Yes.
Kyle: What?!
Pi-Pi: You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.
Kyle: Why?!
Pi-Pi: You swim-a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate.
Kyle: I am not, not, d-rinking pee!
Pi-Pi: But only you can hold-a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!
Stan: Just drink the pee, Kyle.
Butters: Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.
Pi-Pi: What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!
Kyle: That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
Pi-Pi: Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly.
Kyle: No!
Water Tester: Make way! Make way! I need to speak to the fire marshal! Sir! Sir, I just got off the phone with my colleagues at the university! They've also been testing antidotes on monkeys! They're claiming that they've had success using simple Musa acuminata.
Water Tester: Yes.
Fireman 2: Holy God, it works!
Police Captain: All right, let's start moving in, everyone! Check the-
Water Tester: Hold on, ih it is a promising lead, but this antidote hasn't yet been tested on a human.
Researcher 3: He looks agitated...
Randy: Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.
Randy: No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.
Water Tester: He's all right!
Fireman 3: The banana worked!
Stan: Come on, dude!
Kyle: I'm thinking about it!
Jimmy: Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle.
Pi-Pi: Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee.
Butters: You can do it, Kyle!
Butters: Hawww, you lived?
Cartman: Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
Kyle: That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot.
Cartman: It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
Kyle: Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
Stan: Aw come on. It was just a little pee, Kyle.
Water Tester: All right everyone, quick! Here you go!
Butters: What's this?
Fire Marshal: You all need to eat your banana immediately!
Kyle: What the hell for?!
Man: Put it down, you bitch!
Tiger: You're overreacting, you stupid Swedish cow!
Elin: Then why-a the fuck are you getting a text-a message from some-a low-life-a hooker on Thanksgiving?!
Elin: Oh yeah! Take more vitamins, Tiger! That'll help!!
Tiger: Will you just listen to me?!
Elin: Oh where the fuck do ya think-a you're going?!
Stan: What are you guys doing?
Tiger: D'Aaaah! Fuck you, cunt!
Tiger: Aw, look what you did, you crazy bitch!
Cartman: Oh dude, was that a combo move?
Kenny: (Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)
Cartman: Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
Kyle: Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
Cartman: Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
Expert 5: Definitely true.
Chairman: Yes, we all know that, go on.
Expert 4: But in the sex addict, their entire lives are consumed with thoughts of wanting more and more. The mere sight of an attractive woman could... can make them think about sex with her.
Chairman: What could be causing this outbreak of sexual addiction?
Expert 9: Yes
Expert 7: If.so, then the disease could start to affect our children
The class: Oh! Wow. Ohhh.
Kyle: Jesus, dude.
Butters: Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
Expert 9: Please just study the picture the best you can, students. I'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided.
Butters: Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
Kyle: I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
Kenny: (Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)
Expert 9: I'm sorry boys, but I'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction.
Kyle: What?!
Butters: Oh no!
Expert 9: We're gonna have to send you home, I'm afraid.
Kyle: Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?
Expert 9: Our nice-lady-with-the-handkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough. I'm sorry, but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal, well-adjusted students.
Butters: It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
Kyle: So what happens to us now?
Kenny: (Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?)
Expert 9: I don't want to go into too much detail but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome.
Kenny: (Really??)
Butters: Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
Chairman: Ladies and gentlemen, for the past several days we've been screening our nation's schools for signs of sex addiction. The results of our tests are troubling to say the least. Dr. Tonton?
Reporter 1: And so these infected boys will soon be secretly wishing they could be having sex all the time with lots of different people?
Chairman: It appears so.
Reporter 1: The poor bastards!
Reporter 2: But what about us normal healthy adults? Are we at risk of exposure?
Randy: Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
Priest: Sunset and Evening Star, and one clear call for me, and may their be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea.
Kyle: Oh God, it's true.
Priest: But such a tide as moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam, when that which drew from out the boundless deep t-
Commentator: Tiger... lines up his drive. He'll be hoping for a birdie here. Concentration is key.
Elin: How many women did you fuck-a?! How many?!
Stan: Aw dude, I clocked you!
Cartman: I told you this game was sweet, dude.
Cartman: Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
Stan: Hit A and X together.
Cartman: Oh, you're going down, Elin!
Stan: I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
David Letterman: Haha, Oh, ahh, having sex with employees.
Bill Clinton: Putting cigars in girls' vaginas?
Charlie Sheen: Watching Internet porn all day every day?
Kyle: Hello?
The men: Hey Kyle, hi Kyle.
Therapist: And would you care to share your stories with us, boys?
Kyle: Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
Bill Clinton: Does your mom have big tits?
Therapist: Billy!
Butters: Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
Ben Roethlisberger: I heard that.
Butters: I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
Therapist: Mr. Duchovny, please stop jerking off!
Chairman: My God...
Chairman: Incredible. And, and what's it doing now?
Tiger Woods: Avoid drugs? And alcohol?
The other men: Auugh!
Michael Douglas: Caught.
Therapist: Yes, Michael Douglas! Everyone!
The Men: Getting caught.
Ben Rothlisberger: Don't screw girls in the public bathrooms?
David Letterman: When they uh ask you for money, pay them.
Therapist: Good, yes!
Therapist: Yeah, it's me. We've got a turd in the punch bowl. I repeat, we have a turd in the punch bowl.
Chairman: Mr. President, in every test the results were the same. The monkeys who were given cash always acted out their sexual addiction to dangerous levels. It appears that money has a direct effect on the virus's ability to develop.
Obama: So we must keep our nation's youth away from money and success.
Obama: You mean boys will start working towards being rich and successful just so they can one day have sex with lots of women??
Obama: The birthplace of our country.
Chairman: We believe something is happening in Independence Hall that gives money its power over men.
Obama: Independence Hall... Independence Day... Aliens... Gentlemen, I might know what's causing the sex addiction outbreak. This is highly classified, but... in 1947 a flying saucer was discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. Two deceased alien bodies were recovered and hidden from public knowledge. They carried... a virus with them. A virus that only barely stopped from spreading all over the country.
Chairman: And you think that these aliens... could be back with a new virus? One originating from Independence Hall causing rich successful men to have sex with lots of women?!
Tiger: I want to say that I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior. I know that I have severely disappointed all of you. Some have speculated that my wife somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving Night. It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. She has shown nothing but grace and poise-
Tiger: Oh no!
Tiger: Agh! Stop it!
Cartman: Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
Kyle: Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
Butters: Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
Therapist: Don't worry, as soon as it's dead everything will make sense.
Therapist: The infected alien that they just discovered is hiding out at Independence Hall!
Chairman: Mr. President, you aren't safe here. Let us handle this.
SWAT Officer 2: Right side clear!
Expert 4: We must be careful. The alien could have cast some kind of spell of invisibility.
Expert 10: Yes! It explains everything! A wizard alien would be able to cast a spell on our species, causing all the men to become sex addicts.
Obama: Enough! We need to find the wizard alien and break his spell.
Therapist: This is the boy I told you about. And his friend, Bummers.
Chairman: Son, we were told that you think sex addiction can be controlled. That it just takes restraint. Is that true?
Kyle: I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
Chairman: A-mazing. Then the wizard alien spell might not have any power over him! He could draw the bastard out!
Kyle: What?
Kyle: What bastard?
Dr. Tonton: Oh my God there it is!
Obama: Shoot it boys!
Obama: Keep shooting it!
Chairman: My God, they've done it!
Bill Clinton: Look! The sex addiction! It's leavin' my body!
David Letterman: I can feel it! I'm free!
Another addict: We are healed!
News 4 Reporter: We are now with the young boys who helped stop the alien. Boys, how does it feel to be free of your illness?
Cartman: What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
Stan: Yeah, where's all the fighting?
Cartman: Oh really? Sweet.
Stan: All right!
Mr. Garrison: ...and strong vulgar language...
Kenny: (Awesome, dude!)
Mr. Garrison: ...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
Cartman: Oho man, I can't wait!
Mr. Garrison: Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-
Cartman: No on, come on, let's read it now!
Kyle: Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
Cartman: Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
Class: Awww!
Stan: Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
Kyle: No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.
Kyle: I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. [the door opens and a pissed-off Cartman enters and closes the door]
Kenny: (Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)
Cartman: We know, we were just saying that.
Stan: Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
Stephen: John Lennon's dead, Butters.
Kyle: Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
Cartman: It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
Cartman: Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
Kyle: Yeah, sweet.
Kenny: (Awesome.)
Cartman: The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
Kenny: (No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)
Randy: Read what?
Sharon: This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!
Randy: So?
Sharon: Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good!
Randy: Huh?
Randy: "It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-" Ew, Sharon, gross!
Sharon: Nono, just keep reading.
Sharon: I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.
Randy: Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!
Sharon: Randy please! You've got to listen to me!
Sharon: Well?
Randy: It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
Sharon: Right? It's not just me.
Randy: No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!
Sharon: What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.
Randy: NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
Cartman: Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
Cartman: ...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
Stan: Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
Kyle: Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
Cartman: And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
Stan: Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
Cartman: Butters, what are you up to?
Butters: Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
Kim: Today my sisters and I are gonna have to wash something. It's gonna blow!
Butters: Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
Stan: Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!
Butters: I am?
Cartman: Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
Butters: Oh no. Which book was that?
Cartman: Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
Sharon: Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Sheila: We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.
Cartman: That's right.
Randy: Butters? Is that true?
Butters: Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
Gerald: Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.
Butters: Huh?
Gerald: Yeah, it's really amazing.
Sheila: We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.
Mr. Needlebaum: Mr. Butters, we would like to offer you a deal for first publishing rights to your brilliant novel.
Stan: Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!
Kyle: Yeah, we wrote that!
Randy: Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.
Kyle: No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
Stephen: Really amazing.
News Anchor: The book has already sold millions of copies worldwide aaand has been translated into twenty six languages.
Clyde: Hey, here he comes!
Mrs. Streibel: You've changed my life, young man.
Cartman: Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
Butters: Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?
Kyle: Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
Butters: But, you told me I did!
Red: Hey hey, you leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist.
Lola: He's so brooding and full of angst.
Butters: Yeah, I'm broooding.
Cartman: Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
Rebecca: Oh God, you guys are pathetic!
Stan: God-damnit!
Kyle: Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
Cartman: That inconsiderate jerk!
Broderick: Well, obviously. I just think it's wrong to make fun of anybody's physical appearance. My wife is a beautiful woman and I know that most people agree with me.
Matt Lauer: Joining us now is the author of the book, Leopold Stotch, along with his parents.
Stephen: Hello Matt
Linda: Hi everyone.
Matt Lauer: You must be pretty proud of your son.
Stephen: Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented.
Meredith Vieira: And we also learned that your son is grounded. Is that correct?
Stephen: Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course.
Butters: I have to come right to my room after school.
Stephen: But we are very very proud nonetheless.
Butters: Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
Butters: Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
Al Roker: Ronald Reagan is dead now, Butters.
Stan: More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
Assemblyman 1: That's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes.
Cartman: There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
Assemblyman 2: You just fail to understand what the author meant.
Kyle: The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
Stan: Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
Assemblywoman 1: Oh, so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of Sarah Jessica Parker for no reason?
Kyle: Yes!
Assemblywoman 1: But what would be the point?
Cartman: There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
Assemblywoman 2: No writer would take the time to make fun of Sarah Jessica Parker just because they think she's ugly.
Stan, Kyle, Cartman: Yes they would!
Assemblywoman 2: It is because Miss Jessica Parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class.
Stan: What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!
Assemblyman 2: Boys, this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country.
Stan: What?
Assemblywoman 2: Wait, Scrotie McBoogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature!
Assemblyman 2: What book did you read?!
Stan: There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!
Field Reporter: Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?
Butters: Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
Field Reporter: Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book?
Butters: Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
Stephen: Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!
Stan: I can't believe they won't ban our book!
Kyle: I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
Kenny: (It's fucking disgusting!)
Cartman: Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
Cartman: Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
Matt: Well, the day has finally arrived. The eagerly awaited second novel from the author of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently, bookstores are jammed.
Meredith: Al, how is it out there?
Meredith: Well, we've got our vomit buckets ready too, because coming up, a very special in-studio treat.
Matt: That's right, we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio. Na-now we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic, obscene novel of all time, so... brace yourselves for some very harsh language. Take it away Morgan Freeman.
Cartman: See any hunters yet?
Cartman: Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
Kenny: (Huh?)
Kyle: Butters wrote a second book!
Cartman: So what?
Stan: So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
Kyle: We can get people to believe us now!
Morgan Freeman: "Why are we here?" Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener, in a long, thin strip. It was... wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all.
Shopper 1: "The pee he got on the woman's leg, and she screamed, pooping out her boobs."
Shopper 2: "And so when the pee got mixed with the poop, it smelled like a butt."
Cartman: People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
Shopper 3: Are you reading this, Marsha? What do you think?
Marsha: So far I think it's, it's incredible! Ih, it might be better than his first book.
Shopper 4: I agree. It wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots.
Cartman: What?!
Stan: You can't be serious! You people like this?!
Shopper 5: Some of the imagery is unbelievable
Kyle: A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
Marsha: What are you talking about? This book is as pro-life as it gets!
Cartman: Oh come on!
Stan: God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
Kim: Today my sisters and I are gonna shop for underwear.
The Kardashians: Yaaay!
Cartman: Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
Butters: I know.
Stan: They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
Stan: Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
Butters: Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
Cartman: That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
Butters: What?
Butters: What?! Oh no!
Group: Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty.
Coach: You seem to have a stomach ache every time we do drills and exercises.
Coach: Alright kids, practice is over for today.
Cartman: Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
Kyle: Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
Stan: Hey it looks different.
Stan: A what?
Cartman: Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
Kyle: So where's the KFC now?
Clerk: Can I help you sir?
Randy: Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?
Clerk: Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.
Randy: Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?
Clerk: Sure. New state laws say it's okay.
Clerk: Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.
Clerk: Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.
Stan: What'd they say?
Cartman: They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
Stan: The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.
Kyle: ...so no KFC?
Cartman: This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
Dr. Doctor: Well Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal.
Randy: All right!
Dr. Doctor: Yep, you check out fine.
Randy: That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
Dr. Doctor: For what?
Dr. Doctor: Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana.
Randy: But you said I'm totally healthy!
Dr. Doctor: Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.
Randy: Yeah, but what's the quickest way?
Dr. Doctor: The what?
Randy: Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?
Cartman: Mom, drive faster!
Liane: The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.
Cartman: Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
Liane: Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?
Cartman: WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
Liane: Alright honey, let's take it easy.
Cartman: Fuck you!
Worker 1: It's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there.
Cartman: No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
Worker 1: Yeah, well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low-income areas.
Cartman: You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
Worker 2: No you don't get it, kid. KFCs were only in low-income areas. In the entire state of Colorado, Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal.
Clerk 2: Can I help you?
Clerk 2: Alright, sign your name on the release form and put down the time-
Clerk 2: This is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.
Cartman: Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
Randy: Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!
Dr. Doctor: Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer.
Dr. Doctor: Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-
Randy: Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!
Dr. Doctor: Your prescription for what?
Randy: Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...
Randy: One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
Randy: Uh that is nice! That is nice!
Randy: I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?
Jimbo: No, I mean, your actual balls!
Tough Boy 1: Hey kid, they say you're looking for some KFC.
Cartman: Yeah. Who isn't?
Tough Boy 1: Yeah well uh, we got some. Over at Billy Miller's house.
Cartman: Billy Miller? Seriously??
Billy: Ahhh Eric Cartman, right?
Cartman: Tommy said you have some KFC.
Billy: I have my sources. That'll be $85.
Cartman: How much KFC are we talking?
Billy: Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.
Cartman: Holy fuck, dude.
Billy: I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?
Cartman: Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
Billy: Excellent.
Cartman: Are you Teabag?
Teabag: Maybe I am. Who's askin'?
Cartman: Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
Teabag: 'Course, man, I ain't no fool.
Cartman: You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
Teabag: Awww, it's all the same shit, man.
Cartman: You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
Teabag: I'll take back the gravy.
Barbrady: What's going on back there?
Cartman: Nothin', it's cool.
Jimbo: Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned.
Nelson: Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.
Randy: No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.
Player 1: Aw some on, just give us a little bit.
Player 2: Yeah.
Nelson: Women love huge balls?
Randy: See?
Billy: Cartman my boy, you got the stuff?
Billy: Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you!
Billy: That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little "arrangement" with the Colonel himself.
Cartman: Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
Billy: That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?
Cartman: Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
Billy: Excellent.
Dr. Doctor: What the hell is going on?
Nurse: Doctor?
Dr. Doctor: This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.
Jimbo: Heh! Man, I am stoned off my ass!
Randy: Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
Woman 2: Wow. Those guys have nice balls.
Woman 3: Wish my man had balls like those.
Woman 2: Mmm.
The Colonel: Our entire production is headquartered here, boys. We move over sixteen tons of chicken every month. Of course, with the new laws in Colorado my business has taken quite a hit. I'm worried other states might follow suit.
Tommy: We know, Colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. We just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key?
Cartman: I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
Cartman: Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.
The Colonel: And how do I know you're not a liar too?
Cartman: Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
The Colonel: I think... you and me can work this thing out, Eric. Do business together a long time.
Cartman: Good.
Randy: I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
Randy: Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?
Sharon: Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-
Randy: Hey. My eyes are up here.
Sharon: I'm sorry, I just...
Randy: Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?
Clerk: I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.
Randy: Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?
Clerk: Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.
Randy: Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
Billy: What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!
Billy: ...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!
Billy: How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric!
Cartman: ...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
Billy: What is that supposed to mean?
Cartman: Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
Billy's Mom: Billy?! Your father and I want to talk to you!
Randy: What do we want?
Men: Bigger doors!
Randy: Where do we want them?
Men: Weed stores!
Randy: What do we want?
Men: Bigger doors!
Randy: Where do we want them?
Men: Weed stores!
Clerk: Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure.
Man 1: Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.
Man 2: Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others.
Clerk: Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.
Man 3: What's ridiculous about it?
Tough Boy 2: Mr. Cartman, come on. We're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff.
Cartman: Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
Tough Boy 3: Eric, the Colonel is on the phone for you. He sounds pissed.
The Colonel: Hello. Hello??
Cartman: Colonel, how are you doing?
The Colonel: What happened?
The Colonel: Eric, what happened??
Cartman: We had a little problem.
The Colonel: I heard.
The Colonel: Because Jamie Oliver gave his speech at the UN today. He was not supposed to give that speech, Eric!
Cartman: Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
The Colonel: There's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker!
Cartman: Hey, take it easy Colonel.
The Colonel: I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!
Barbrady: Freeze!
Billy: Mommy, no!
Sharon: Yeah. Great.
Nelly's Mom: Sharon, you got a scrotum coat?
Sharon: Yyyup!
Woman 5: Luckyyyyy!
Cartman: I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
Kyle: How the hell do you have more friends than me?
Cartman: 'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
Kyle: How many friends do you have, Kenny?
Kenny: (Sixty two.)
Kyle: What? How the hell do I only have thirty seven friends?
Stan: Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be out playing video games.
Kyle: Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
Stan: Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
Cartman: Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
Stan: Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
Kyle: Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Stan: I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
Cartman: Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy.
Stan: Who?
Kyle: Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
Kyle: There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
Kip: Mom, Dad! I made a friend today!
Kip's Mom:: Kip, really?
Kip's Dad:: You did?
Kip's Dad:: Huh son, that's wonderful.
Kip's Mom:: What's his name?
Kip: Kyle Broflovski! He's a student, and his interests include video games and reading.
Kip's Mom:: Oh, is he a nice boy?
Randy: Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?
Stan: Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to.
Randy: Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
Stan: ...Dad, you are my friend.
Randy: ...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?
Stan: Dad, it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
Randy: Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?
Stan: I just wanna do my homework!
Stan: Alright, Dad, I'll add you!
Kip: Mom, Dad, my best friend Kyle? He went to the dentist yesterday, and got two fillings! And today he's wondering if Hurt Locker really deserved the Oscar!
Kip's Mom:: That's great, Kip!
Kip's Dad:: They sure are getting to know each other.
Kip's Mom:: It's amazing! You know Kip spent the morning at the boy's farm?
Kip's Dad:: His friend lives on a farm?
Wendy: Am I a joke to you?
Wendy: I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?
Stan: ...Um, no?
Wendy: You DO have a Facebook page, Stan!
Stan: Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
Wendy: Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?
Stan: Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
Stan: Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
Wendy: And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to "In a relationship"!
Stan: How?
Wendy: By editing your profile under "basic information"!
Stan: Okay, I'm sorry!
Stan: "Edit profile. Basic... settings" Jesus Christ!
Randy: Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
Stan: ...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
Randy: Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
Stan: Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
Kyle: Can I come in?
Kyle: I... don't... have... any... friends...
Stan: What?
Kyle: I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
Stan: Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.
Kyle: 'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?
Stan: NO.
Kyle: Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
Stan: Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
Stan: Okay it says I'm at your farm.
Stan: 'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
Kyle: Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
Kip's Dad:: So Kip, you spend more time with your buddy Kyle today?
Kip: Oh yeah Dad, we've been havin' the best time! I showed him all the pictures of me and that silly Halloween costume last year.
Kip: He laughed out loud. And then he was rollin' on the floor laughin'!
Kip's Dad:: Sounds like you boys had a ball!
Kip: Mom, Dad, I'm all done. Can I go hang out with Kyle and tell him all about what I had for dinner?
Kip's Dad:: Well it's a little late, but it is Friday.
Kip's Mom:: I think the more time you spend with your little friend, the better.
Wendy: "I think you look cute in your bunny costume."
Stan: What?
Wendy: "I think you look cute in your bunny costume." What is that supposed to mean?!
Stan: ...I have no idea.
Man 2:: Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request?
Randy: Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
Stan: ...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-
Randy: Stan, poke your grandma!
Computer Voice: I'm gonna have to put you on the game grid.
Guard 1:: Alright get moving, Profile.
Stan: Profile? I'm not a profile.
Profile 1:: Tom Davis says hello to Linda Green's profile.
Profile 2:: Linda Davis likes how Tom Davis has changed his status.
Stan: Excuse me, my name is-
Profile 3:: Ignore.
Stan: Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
Profile 4:: Ignore.
Kyle: I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
Cartman: You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
Kyle: I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
Cartman: Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
Kyle: I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
Cartman: It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
Kyle: No. What's chatroulette?
Cartman: Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
Kyle: Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.
Cartman: Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
Cartman: Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
Kyle: That's just a guy's penis too!
Cartman: Okay let's, let's try this one.
Cartman: This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
Cartman: Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
Kyle: Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
Cartman: Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
Stan: Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
Tom Davis: No, you aren't my friend. Would you like to be my friend?
Stan: No, I seriously don't want any more friends.
Stan: Okay I'll be your friend.
Stan: Awww!
Tom Davis: Oh oh.
Stan: Why oh oh?
Profile 5:: They're taking him to the gaming arena.
Stan: Yahtzee?
Profile 6:: Uhhh, I'm gonna count five in my five box.
Stan: Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
Boy: Hello.
Cartman: Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
Boy: Oh that's cool. I was startin' to think this was nothin' but dudes jackin' off.
Kyle: Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
Boy: Uhh, sure. If you'll come and visit my farm.
Kyle: Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
Kip's Dad:: Honey, where's Kip? I haven't seen him all day.
Kip's Mom:: No, he's been out spending the whole day with his best friend Kyle. I think they're at the movies now.
Referee: Troublemaker! You were not supposed to survive the game of Yahtzee! You have made things complicated!
Stan: I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
Referee: That's not what your profile said.
Stan: My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
Referee: Your profile is one of the most powerful in all of Facebook. You cannot stop it now.
Referee: After him!
Stan: You're an asshole, Kyle!
Stan: What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
Stan: What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
Kyle: Profile status?
Stan: Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
Kyle: Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
Stan: Where?
Kyle: Caf World.
Kyle: An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
Stan: Jesus Christ.
Randy's profile:: Randy Marsh is at work right now. Work is boring.
Butters' profile:: Butters Stotch is enjoying Stan's chat party.
Garrison's profile:: Herbert Garrison likes Butters' comment.
Grandma Marsh's profile:: Grandma Marsh would like to be friends with Kevin Donahue.
Kevin Donahue's profile:: Kevin Donahue accept's Grandma Marsh's friendship.
Stan: Has anybody seen my stupid profile?!
Susan92's profile:: Susan92 has pictures of Stan in a bunny costume.
Gary Johnson's profile:: Gary Johnson thinks the pictures are fantastic!
Kyle: Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
Isiah: Isiah's order is on leaving Kyle Broflovski as a friend.
Kyle: What? Why?
Isiah: User saw you were friends with Kip Drordy, who only has one friend. Kyle Broflovski is bad friend stock.
Kyle: Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
Isiah: Ignore.
Kyle: Unh, that does it!
Stan: Oh...
Stan: What do you want from me, dude?!
Profile Stan Marsh: I'm your profile, and as you can see, I am much more powerful than you.
Stan: Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
Profile Stan Marsh: Why do you think I brought you in here? The fact of the matter is I'm up and running now with almost a million friends. I don't need you anymore. I have more friends than you'll ever have in the real world.
Stan: Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
Profile Stan Marsh: What did I tell you?! That's a large flush already! You don't have a chance in here, user! You pathetic little-
Stan: Yahtzee.
Profile Stan Marsh: What?!
Stan: Yahtzee. Sixes.
Profile Stan Marsh: No. Can't be.
Randy: Yahtzee!
Randy: Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?
Stan: My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
Randy: Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?
Tour Guide: Our factory works 24/7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. Here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk.
Kyle: You should know, fatass.
Cartman: AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
Tour Guide: And here is where all the fudge is put into boxes to be shipped all over the world.
Kyle: Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
Cartman: I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
Butters: Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?
Tom Cruise: What did you call me?
Butters: How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?
Tom Cruise: I'm not a fudge packer!
Kyle: Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
Stan: Then why are you packing fudge?
Stan: Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
Tom Cruise: Oh, that does it. I will SUE you!
Stan: For what?
Mr. Garrison: Hey, is that fudge-packer Tom Cruise?
Stan: But dude-
Tom Cruise: No buts! If you want to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker, you're gonna pay the consequences!
Tiger Woods: That town just seems to be a hotbed of hatred and lies!
Bono: I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit!
George Lucas: That place thinks they can say whatever they want about us and get away with it!
Tom Cruise: Yeah, well I say enough. All of us together can put a stop to that slander coming from that town once and for all! No longer will they make snide remarks about whoever they want.
All Celebrities: YEAH!
Jared Fogle: Hey, Tom. I ate too much Subway. Where's your bathroom?
Kyle: Dude, what did you do?
Stan: I have no idea...
Randy: You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!
Principal Victoria: Did you call him a fudge packer?
Stan: Aww... he was packing fudge!
Mayor: Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!
Mr. Mackey: They are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town, m'kay!
Stan: It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
Principal Victoria: But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.
Gerald: Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!
Sgt. Yates: Dammit Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly son in line!
Randy: Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!
Randy: Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.
Tom Cruise: WHAT?
Randy: We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...
Tom Cruise: Well, there is... one thing that your town could do to... maybe make me forget about this lawsuit.
Randy: ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.
Tom Cruise: It's just that there's somebody that I have always wanted to meet... face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town-
Randy: Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.
Tom Cruise: Muhammad. The prophet of the Muslim faith.
Stan: Ooooooo...
Randy: That's... tricky...
Randy: Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-
Tom Cruise: No! Just him. You get Muhammad to appear or your little town is DONE!
Randy: Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.
Stephen: Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.
Mr. Mackey: But even if it were safe for Muhammad to be shown, how would we ever find him?
Stan: Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?
Stan: No, dude, it was totally fine.
Sgt. Yates: Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?
Stan: Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
Jimbo: I don't know. I guess we'll see.
Hillary Clinton: Tom, what is up with this Muhammad thing? It doesn't make sense!
Jesse Jackson: Yeah, you said we were just suing South Park.
Tom Cruise: No, I said we were going to use South Park to make sure we never got ripped on again. Look people, all of us get ridiculed, but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander?
Oprah Winfrey: You want Muhammad because he can't be ridiculed?
Jimmy Buffett: I... I'd love it!
Tim Burton: Gee, that'd be swell.
Tom Cruise: Hey! It's one of the boys from South Park who slandered me!
Cartman: I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
Jennifer Lopez: Yes, I am Hennifer Lopez, and I like tacos and burritos.
Seaman: It's not semen, it's Seaman!
Stan: Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.
Jesus: My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances.
Buddha: We simply cannot risk any violence from the Muslim people
Stan: Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
Narrator: Back in the hall of the Super Best Friends...
Kyle: Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
Joseph Smith: No, Muslims would still be angry if you showed his face.
Kyle: K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
Lao Tzu: No, cause you would still be showing him walking around, that could be a-trouble.
Stan: Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
Jesus: But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.
Kyle: A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
Joseph Smith: But he's talking from the U-Haul?
Stan: Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
Moses: Um... would there be windows on the U-Haul?
Kyle: There doesn't have to be...
Moses: Um... I guess... I guess that would be okay.
Tom Cruise: Here it is friends. Once we have Muhammad, this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of.
Tom Cruise: Rob Reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth.
Cartman: Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
Tom Cruise: No Jen, we all have got enough money.
Jennifer Lopez: Yes, who needs more money, we need to get Muhammad's goo! Yes, yes, ariva ariva!
Cartman: Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
Jennifer Lopez: What am I doing? Just having some fun, cholo!
Cartman: Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
Jennifer Lopez: Just keep your mouth shut, and do what I tell you!
Mitch Conner: If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut, kid.
Cartman: You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
Mitch Conner: Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo.
Cartman: Yeah, so what?
Mitch Conner: You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo.
Cartman: So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
Jennifer Lopez: Oh, your secret is safe with me, Tommy!
Randy: Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.
Mr Garrison: Oh, is that okay?
Jimbo: I don't know.
Randy: Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.
Stan: What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
Gerald: Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
Kyle: But Muhammad can't be seen dad.
Sgt. Yates: Alright, we'll put a sheet over him.
Stan: No, you can't even show his feet.
Sheila: How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?
Mr. Garrison: No, you could still see his eyes...
Mayor: Muhammad, would that be OK?
Tom Cruise: Rob, will the machine be ready?
Cartman: No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
Jennifer Lopez: More tacos.
Cartman: You just had seven tacos.
Jennifer Lopez: I am Jennifer Lopez, I need tacos to live!
Charlie Sheen: Mrs. Lopez, I can go. What do you want, like three tacos?
Jennifer Lopez: Oh, thank you 'harlie Sheeeeen. And maybe an enchirito too?
Cartman: Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
Jennifer Lopez: Yes they do!
Cartman: I tried getting one last week!
Jennifer Lopez: Not all Taco Bells have enchiritos, but some still carry them.
Cartman: God, will somebody shut her up?
Mr. Garrison: Stop! There's some extremists, threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they're gonna bomb us!
Mayor: What?!
Randy: What the hell was that?!
Stan: They want his power?
Sgt. Yates: You won't believe it...
Lead Ginger: Our time is near! Soon, gingers will never be made fun of again!
Mitch Conner: Where the hell do you think you're going?
Cartman: Let me by...
Mitch Conner: You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life.
Cartman: My father...
Mitch Conner: Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right?
Cartman: I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
Cartman: How could you know anything about who my family is?
Mitch Conner: Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return.
Cartman: If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
Mitch: You just take me where I tell you, and when you learn the truth, you will learn to trust me. And nobody else...
Barbrady: Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.
Sgt. Yates: Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible!
Mayor: Jesus, what are we supposed to do?!
Jimbo: We have to give in to their demands.
McDaniels: I'm sorry Muhammad, but we are going to have to give you over the gingers.
Kyle: We can't give him over to the gingers!
Stan: Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.
Gerald: But our homes and our lives are at stake.
Randy: Helllo?
Tom Cruise: Yeah, so whats going on?
Randy: Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.
Tom Cruise: What do you mean, you're not givin' him to us?!
Randy: There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.
Tom Cruise: Gingers?
Kanye West: Gingers? Aww, hell no.
Randy: Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.
Tom Cruise: You're going to give Muhammad to gingers instead of us, just because they are threatening you with violence?
Randy: Well, yeah.
Rob Reiner: Tom, Tom. We can't be seen getting violent.
Hillary Clinton: Yeah, that would kill all our careers!
Rob Reiner: There she is Tom... Barbra Streisand.
Robert Redford: My God, she's even more terrifying than I remember.
Steven Spielberg: Tom, Barbra Streisand hasn't been active for a long time. Are we sure we want to do this?
Tom Cruise: Mrs. Streisand got torn apart in the town of South Park. She's probably more angry at that town than any of us.
Rob Reiner: Listen, Babs, we are taking on the town of South Park and we really need your help
Tom Cruise: Oh, she's pissed all right.
Mr. Garrison: Eric, what are you doing here?
Cartman: Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
Mr. Garrison: What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-
Cartman: I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
Mr. Garrison: Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-
Cartman: I said GET. Mr. Hat!
Mitch Conner: Good to see you Hat. Helluva night, isn't it?
Mr. Hat: I... I don't believe I know you.
Mr. Garrison: Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-
Cartman: Keep... your hand... UP!
Lead Ginger: Nuh uh, first you gotta prove that that is still Muhammad in there! Have him step out of the bear costume...
Townspeople: Ohhhhhhh...
Stan: Dude, we can't do that
Lead Ginger: Show us it's Muhammad or South Park is finished!
Mr. Hat: Dammit Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered!
Mr. Garrison: No Mr. Hat, don't say any more!
Mitch: Yeah, tell 'im whatcha know!
Garrison: Alright Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with.
Cartman: By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
Soldier 1: What's the matter, Conner? You don't like a little blood?
Mitch Conner: No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner.
Army Doctor: Conner, Mitchell. You're discharged, son.
Mitch Conner: Sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.
Cartman: That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
Randy: Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.
Ginger 1: We have no way of knowing if Muhammad is really in there. It could be a trick.
Stan: It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
Ginger 1: Then have him step out of the bear costume! You have until the count of ten! One!
Jimbo: Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.
Ginger 1: Two!
Ginger 1: Three!
Stan: Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.
Ginger 2: That isn't Muhammad, that's Santy Claus.
Santa: Sorry, boys. I tried.
Kyle: Aw crap.
Randy: Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?
Stan: When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
Stan: If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
Announcer: Meanwhile, at the Hall of the Super Best Friends...
Jesus: Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem.
Buddha: Ohhh, and you're one to talk! With all your Internet porn!
Jesus: Watching porn isn't like doing coke, fag!
Jesus: What?
Jesus: On the Super Best Screen!
Lao Tse: I thought Barbra Streisand had been destroyed by Robert Smith.
Seaman: Yeah. Who would have activated her again?
Police Officer: The Casa Bonita is gone! Jesus help us!
Dr. Mephesto: Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in.
Person: Yo, I understand, man, but this accident is real bad, dawg. My lady's leg is all busted up and shit; she all crawlin' around on the road lookin' like a crippled crab, man. I just need an ambulance, dog!
Dr. Mephesto: There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there.
Person: Okay, I see. I guess I understand. You just don't wanna let a black man in yo' house.
Dr. Mephesto: No, please, it isn't that at all.
Person: No, I gets it man. Thought things had changed, dog. Thought when we got a black president, things would be different. We gots our black president, but Whitey still don't trust me to use his motherfuckin' phone.
Dr. Mephesto: WAAH!
Kevin: AAAH!
Cartman: Nice work, Conner.
Mitch Conner: Yeah, the old "Hasn't anything changed?" speech. Works on white people all the time.
Dr. Mephesto: Eric Cartman?
Cartman: Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
Announcer: Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom, which is Tom Cruise's house.
Tom Cruise: How do you like that?! Celebrities can get violent too!
Randy: We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
Tom Cruise: That's your problem! Get him back or Babs will kill you all!
Mickey Mouse: Oh boy!
Stan: Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!
Stan: Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.
Stan: The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
Kenny: (What?)
Kyle: Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
Richard Tweek: She's going to get our coffee store next.
Joseph Smith: No good!
Dr. Mephesto: Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them.
Cartman: Them who?!
Dr. Mephesto: Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.
Cartman: Then start explaining it to me!
Kyle: Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.
Stan: Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!
Kyle: Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
Dr. Mephesto: Oh, all right.
Cartman: No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
Stan: Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
Cartman: It's all that matters!
Kyle: Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
Cartman: I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
Joseph Smith: We can't attack Streisand's nose! It's just too big!
Moses: What?
Jesus: We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!
Moses: Um... Let me think... Um... Oh I know... Barbra Streisand can't resist singing duets with Neil Diamond.
Seaman: It's Sea-Man and Swallow.
Jesus: Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!
Moses: Heh heh heheheh. No way he just said that.
Stan: Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
Dr. Mephesto: It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.
Kyle: Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
Mitch Conner: Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart?
Mitch Conner: Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!
Kyle: Stop talking with your stupid hand!
Cartman: Who you calling stupid, Jew?
Dr. Mephesto: Yes?
Man: Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone.
Dr. Mephesto: Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American.
Man: ...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.
Dr. Mephesto: Beat it I'm not helpin' you!
Kyle: Dude!
Stan: That's not cool!
Dr. Mephesto: No no, you don't understand.
Kyle: We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
Stan: We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
Ginger 1: Hahaaa!
Stan: Oh crap, the gingers!
Cartman: Gingers? No!
Announcer: L-later, at the Legion of Doom.
Benedict XVI: Tom, Tom! The gingers are claiming they have Muhammad!
Tom Cruise: What?! Impossible!
Benedict XVI: They are sending a message now!
Rob Reiner: He's useless to you! You can't get Muhammad's power to not be made fun of without the Rob Reiner Goo Transfer Machine!
Ginger 1: Why do you think we're calling?!
Ginger 3: Our boss is willing to share Muhammad with you if you're willing to share the goo machine with us!
Tom Cruise: ...Your ...boss?
Dr. Mephesto: What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go.
Ginger 1: Oh no no! The head ginger has plans for you!
Stan: What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!
Cartman: Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
Mitch Conner: You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid.
Cartman: Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
A Voice: Eric Cartman. I've waited a long time for this.
Cartman: Daddy?
Cartman: Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
Announcer: Meanwhile, at the concert stage Jesus built with his power of super-carpentry...
Joseph Smith: It worked, Jesus!
Jesus: Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!
Cartman: What do you know?!
Paris Hilton: O M G it worked!
Tom Cruise: I've done it! I've done it! Look at me! I'm not okay to make fun of anymore!
Benedict XVI: Ooo you lucky fucker.
Scott Tenorman: Welcome, everyone, to the final act of my fabulous Chili Carnival!
Liane: Please, leave my boy alone!
Cartman: Mom?
Scott Tenorman: I got them all here for you, Eric! So listen while you got told the truth!
Mr. Garrison: Please don't. We have to protect 'em.
Cartman: Protect who??
Jimbo: Protect... the Denver Broncos.
Announcer: Meanwhile...
Tom Cruise: This is incredible. Who wants to go next?
Benedict XVI: I want to be next.
Ginger 4: No, gingers go next.
Mickey Mouse: Gingers can suck it! I'm next, ha!
Rob Reiner: It's my goo machine! I'm next!
Ginger 4: They can't stop all of us! Get 'em!
Mr. Garrison: They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!
Cartman: My dad was a Denver Bronco?
Scott Tenorman: Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos?
Cartman: No- nooo.
Scott Tenorman: The only Bronco who lived in South Park. He got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named Liane Cartman!
Liane: No please!
Dr. Mephesto: It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.
Scott Tenorman: You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!
Cartman: No! Noooo!
Tom Cruise: What did you say?!
Kyle: Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
Jesus: Who's the creepy ginger kid?
Tom Cruise: Reiner, you said the goo machine would work! But I got made fun of!
Jesus: That's right. Don't you see, gingers? If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.
Santa: That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.
Mayor McDaniels: Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.
Kyle: Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
Cartman: Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
Stan: Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
Cartman: My dad was a ginger!
Kyle: Wwait, what?
Cartman: I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
Kyle: Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
Cartman: What?
Mitch Conner: Come on, cheer up.
Cartman: Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
Mitch Conner: Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool.
Kyle: You gotta be kidding me!
Cartman: Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
Mitch Conner: There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.
Stan: Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.
Tom Cruise: I... I just can't do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there's nowhere on earth that people aren't around to rip on me.
Kyle: Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
Stan: We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!
Stan: We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
Stan: Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
Kyle: If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
Jimmy: Oh boy, Timmy, it's our favorite time of year.
Timmy: Timmeh!
Jimmy: We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Francis. Hey Francis!
Stan: Cartman, dude, what's wrong?
Kyle: Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Something's going on.
Cartman: It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
Kyle: "What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?
Stan: Why not?
Cartman: Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
Stan: Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
Kyle: Aww. Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
Stan: Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.
Cartman: I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
Stan: Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
Cartman: Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
Cartman: You love NASCAR huh?
Stan: Dude, you are so retarded!
Cartman: Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
Kyle: How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
Kyle: I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
Cartman: Butters.
Butters: Hey Eric.
Butters: Eeyeah, I'm psyched.
Cartman: Get really psyched up, Butters!
Cartman: I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
Butters: NASCA- NASCAR?
Butters: You're givin' away all your money??
Butters: You sure you want to do this?
Spokesman: Alright folks, we wanna thank you all for comin' out an' supporting NASCAR.
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Kenny: (Yeah! Yeeaahh!)
Butters: Hey Eric.
Cartman: Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
Butters: Feel stupid yet?
Cartman: Not yet.
Woman 1: When a woman isn't feeling her freshest, she turns to Vagisil-
Cartman: Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!
Woman 1: To stop feminine itching, and relieve vaginal odors.
Cartman: Fucking gross!
Butters: All those ladies have stinky vaginas?
Woman 1: If you develop an allergic reaction, see your doctor. In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.
Woman 2: For the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do.
Cartman: "Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes."
Butters: Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings.
Cartman: Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
Butters: Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?
Cartman: I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
Butters: But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
Butters: Really?
Cartman: Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
Butters: That was fast.
Cartman: Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
Dale: What?
Butters: Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
Announcer: Let the race begin!
Butters: I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
Cartman: What's that?
Butters: There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
Announcer: It looks like the Dale Evans car is going the wrong way!
Cartman: All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
Butters: Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
Butters: Eric! Don't ever talk like that!
Cartman: I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
Butters: How bad is it, doctor?
Doctor: He has two fractured ribs, a broken femur, torn ligaments in both knees, and a level 2 concussion. He also appears to be developing three small vaginas in his stomach, but they are all sparkling clean.
Butters: Well at least there's that.
Cartman: Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
Doctor: You aren't on life-support. Pulling a plug wouldn't do anything.
Cartman: Aw donkey balls...
Cartman: Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
Butters: Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
Cartman: Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
Reporter: The NASCAR fan vows he will try to do it again, but that this time, he'll win.
Kenny: (Dude, fuck you!)
Cartman: Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
Kenny: (Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
Cartman: Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I've had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
Cartman: Yeah?
Man: My name is Geoff Hamill. I'm the founder and CEO of Vagisil.
Cartman: ...Uh oh.
Geoff Hamill: Vagisil would like you to represent us in the next NASCAR race.
Cartman: Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
Geoff Hamill: And we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child.
Announcer: We are now live at the NASCAR press conference, where the drivers of Saturday's race are gearing up and taking questions from reporters.
Jimmie Johnson: Well I think it's a fine track, you know. The- the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems-
Reporter 2: Uhhh they're saying hot weather tomorrow; any concerns about restrictor plate or brake fade problems?
Jeff Gordon: Of course, any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid, but the plates themselves-
Cartman: Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
Dale Earnhardt, Jr.: Hey excuse me, who is this kid? Is he even a driver?
Cartman: Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
Danica Patrick: Can we just, get back to the subject of racing, please?
Cartman: Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
Butters: You seemed really stupid, Eric.
Cartman: Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
Tony Kornheiser: Alright, from the NFL we now turn to the world of NASCAR! People who weren't sure what to think of NASCAR are more sure today after a NASCAR driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast.
Butters: Obama's fuckin' gay.
Cartman: He's fuckin' gay as hell!
Butters: Pissin' me off!
Commentator 1: The stage is set for what could be the most important race of the NASCAR year.
Commentator 2: Lots of speculation and interest in the Vagisil car, driven by Eric Cartman. We are joined now by the inventor and owner of Vagisil, Geoff Hamill.
Geoff: Thank you, Chris.
Geoff: Vagisil is very excited to be part of the NASCAR phenomenon, Chris. You know, I... first created Vagisil to try and help my wife, Patty. She is my Muse, my flame. Wherever Patty goes her smile lights up the room. Her vagina, on the other hand, clears the room and makes it uninhabitable for weeks.
Commentator 1: Ohkay, well the race is about to start, so why don't we kick it back down to the track?
Cartman: Alright, "start your engine." What's that mean?
Butters: Yeah, he's a champion alright.
Kenny: (Aww, come on!)
Security Guard: Look, NASCAR is trying to change its image. It's people like you that are givin' NASCAR a bad name!
Pit Crewman: This is just the pace lap, you don't go full speed yet!
Danica Patrick: Oh, son of a bitch!
Cartman: Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
Commentator 1: And it looks like the Vagisil car has already clipped two other drivers and taken them out of the race.
Chris: Yea, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?
Butters: That's fuckin' gay as hell.
Butters: There you go. You're back on the track.
Chris: Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill.
Lowes Pit Boss: Ma'am? You are on an active racetrack. This is extremely dangerous.
Cartman: Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck mah car.
Butters: I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
Geoff Hamill: Patty, you are my Muse, and my flame.
Announcer: Big celebration for the Lowe's Home Improvement team.
Geoff Hamill: Patty! How could you?! You've ruined us! You've ruined Vagisil!
Cartman: Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
Ike: Muff cabbage!
Kyle: The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".
Ike: Muff cabbage.
Sheila: A new family moved in? Where are they from?
Kyle: She said they're from New Jersey.
Kyle: Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
Kyle: Know what, Ma?
Ike: Muff cabbage!
Sheila: Never invite a New Jersey housewife into your home.
Teresa: Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me.
Teresa: Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name?
Sharon: Oh, Linda, huh?
Randy: I don't really work out.
Sharon: Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah.
Teresa: That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No.
Sharon: Wow.
Joe: Take it easy.
Teresa: Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Meeee!
Stan: You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
Cartman: You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
Stan: They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."
Jersey Man: Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey.
Cartman: Aw, crap, there's more of them?
Teresa: Danielle was being a stupid bitch.
Woman 1: Shut up, Teresa. You're pathetic!
Jacqueline: And Sicilian.
Caroline: I'm having my face shaved. It's a Jersey thing.
Jacqueline: When the salon girl told Teresa to sit down, I thought Teresa was gonna bust a tit.
Teresa: Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here!
Caroline: Teresa! Calm down.
Salon Girl: I don't have to take your shit! I'm from Jersey!
Teresa: Get her, Sharon!
Sharon: What?
Jacqueline: Sharon, just stay out of it!
Caroline: Be the bigger person, Sharon!
Sharon: You people are crazy.
Teresa: Who the fuck are you to tell ME what to do?!
Teresa: Psycho bitch!
Sharon: Sheila?
Mr. Garrison: Jesus! Why are they doing this?
Randy: More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
Jimbo: Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!
All: Yeah!
Sheila: That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.
Sharon: Sheila, who are you talking to?
Cartman: You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
Kyle: What are you talking about?
Cartman: Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
Kyle: So what?
Kyle: No, it doesn't!
Kyle: I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
Cartman: Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
Kyle: What's strike three?!
Stan: Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
Kyle: Why does it matter?!
Stan: No, uh, it just explains a lot.
Kyle: No, it isn't!
Cartman: Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
Stan: Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Sheila: Kyle, open the door.
Kyle: Not now, Mom. Please.
Sheila: I guess we need to talk.
Sheila: I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.
Sheila: When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.
Sheila: I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.
Sheila: It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.
Announcer: Live from St. Louis, New Jersey! It's the "Jersey News" with anchormen P-Train and Tan Jovi!
P-Train: What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago.
Tan Jovi: What's up with that?!
P-Train: What's up with that?!
Randy: Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.
Schwarzenegger: Ve are very sore-y, but Cal-i-for-ni-a cannot afford helping you at this time.
Randy: Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
Schwarzenegger: No, because U-tah is between Colo-rah-do and Cal-i-for-ni-a.
Randy: Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!
Schwarzenegger: Nevada.
Randy: Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!
Cartman: What the hell are you guys doing?!
Stan: Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
Kyle: I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
Cartman: Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
Kyle: That's enough!
Cartman: Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
Stuart: We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
Mr. Garrison: What are you talking about?
Randy: We could ask Al Qaeda.
Randy: Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
Stephen: And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!
Bar Patron 1: Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bar quick! There's trouble!
Randy: People from Jersey?
Skeeter: It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed the cigarette machine in half.
Randy: What is it?
Randy: That thing is famous? Why?
Bar Patron 2: I don't know!
Stephen: Aaagh! Get it off of me!
Cartman: So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open.
Butters: Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
Butters: Are you being serious?
Butters: Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
Snooki: Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
Cartman: Come on, you guys, hurry!
Cartman: I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
Cartman: Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
Kyle: You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
Cartman: Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
Kyle: I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
Stan: Dude, what are you doing?
Cartman: Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
Kyle: No, I- I'm serious. What is that behind you?
Snooki: Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
Stephen: Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?
Mr. Garrison: He's still questioning that new prisoner.
Randy: Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!
Randy: What does that mean?!
Randy: Stop playing stupid!
Jimbo: Maybe he really is stupid, Randy.
Sharon: Is it them, Randy?
Randy: Yup. They're from Jersey alright.
Jersey People: Yeah! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Yeah!
Jersey Man 2: Let's go creepin' in this town!
Snooki: Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
Cartman: What does it want?!
Butters: Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.
Cartman: No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
Stan: Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
Stan: Dude.
Snooki: Snooki just, uh, smoosh in the... the tenth...
Jimbo: That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
Randy: Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
Stan: Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
Kyle: Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
Stan: I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
Kyle: It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
Randy: We got him!
Butters: Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
Stan: A note?
Kyle: What's it say?
Red: Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy?
Wendy: Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called "hoarding." People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.
Stan: My locker?
Stan: Are you serious?
Stan: Well it's just a little messy.
Wendy: No, Stan, it's called "hoarding"! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!
Stan: Aw come on.
Wendy: Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?
Stan: Yeah, alright.
Stan: What, come on, it's not that bad.
Dr. Chinstrap: Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out.
Stan: My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
Stan: Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
Stan: Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
Dr. Chinstrap: But it's broken.
Stan: Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-
Stan: Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
Dr. Chinstrap: It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?
Stan: Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
Dr. Chinstrap: The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?
Dr. Chinstrap: Now how about this empty aspirin bottle?
Stan: Well no, don't throw that out.
Stan: I don't... I don't know.
Kyle: Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
Stan: Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."
Mr. Mackey: Hoarding? M'kay, what's that?
Stan: Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
Mr. Mackey: Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey: Me? ...Like, like what?
Mr. Mackey: DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! M'KAY?!
Dr. Chinstrap: There's no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he's easily a Class-3.
Principal Victoria: But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?
Sharon: Yes, our son has always been fairly clean.
Dr. Chinstrap: We don't know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it's okay with you, we'd like to run some tests on the both of them.
Sharon: Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.
Randy: Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.
Dr. Chinstrap: Oh no, really?
Sgt. Yates: Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.
Partner: Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Dr. Chinstrap is a professional at memory regression. This should prove very helpful.
Dr. Chinstrap: Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it's office hoarding, or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals.
Mr. Yelman: Excuse me, but uh, I am a sheep herder.
Dr. Chinstrap: It's pronounced "hoarder," and yes you are.
Mr. Yelman: But but I, uh I'm actually herding sheep.
Dr. Chinstrap: Yes, you are hurting sheep by hoarding them, aren't you? It's good you realize that.
Mr. Yelman: No, but I just thought that-
Dr. Chinstrap: Now listen: there's a psychological reason you're all doing this, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. We're gonna do some regression therapy. I'll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uh-kay?
Mr. Mackey: What?! What?! Jesus, what?!
Mr. Yelman: Oh my God!
Mr. Mackey: Billy, ...Billy Thompson?
Mackey: Oh uh, hi Billy. Nice to see ya, m'kay?
Mackey: Uh well, actually I need to get home, m'kay? I uh...
Billy: You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.
Stan: What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?
Mackey: Shh. Be quiet.
Mr. Yelman: 'Scuse me, where are we?
Mackey: Shh. You've gotta be quiet. Billy Thompson's out there.
Stan: What the hell's going on?!
Dr. Chinstrap: What the hell is going on?!
Partner: The counselor's flat top readers are calculating with the boy's and the sheep hoarder's.
Dr. Chinstrap: Oh Jesus.
Randy: What does that mean?
Dr. Chinstrap: It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.
Randy: What?!
Partner: I'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream.
Randy: Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?
Dr. Chinstrap: It's not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I'll provide the background.
Mackey: Yay, my bedroom! Yep, this is my happy place, m'kay?
Stan: Mr. Mackey.
Stan: Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?
Mackey: Well this is a Lite Brite, m'kay. I can make things with light, like um, birds, m'kay, clowns, m'kay.
Stan: Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!
Stan: Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
Mackey: Hey, look what's on! It's ZOOM!
Mr. Yelman: Excuse me, I really need to get back to my sheep.
Stan: I'm working on it!
Billy: You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is the field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget!
Mackey: No, uh Billy, please, uh-kay? I'm really sorry about the smoking thing, uh.
Stan: Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
Stan: Oh-Ohhhhhhh.
Mr. Mackey: Ohhhhhhh, m'kay.
Randy: What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!
Dr. Chinstrap: Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen.
Dr. Chinstrap: What are you doing?!
Dr. Chinstrap: Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state!
Dr. Chinstrap: It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous!
Randy: I said get me in there!
Randy: Ahhh.
Bus Driver: Alright kids, everyone on the bus.
Stan: Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
Mackey: It's the day of the big field trip.
Mackey: Oh Jesus.
Stan: Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
Bus Driver: Everyone on the bus now! We're runnin' late!
Mr. Yelman: Excuse me, I'm actually a sheep herder.
Mr. Yelman: Yes, but I, I'm so- wah- um.
Stan: Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
Stan: Dad? Is that you?
Randy: Yes, it's me, Stan.
Stan: Where are you?
Stan: The hell are you doing, dad?
Randy: I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
Stan: Did you come here to help me?
Randy: I was gonna, but ooh! This is fun!
Stan: Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
Randy: Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.
Stan: DAD!
Pinkerton: Uh oh, something's wrong.
Dr. Chinstrap: What is it?!
Pinkerton: The father. He's gone completely off chart.
Sharon: Off chart? What does that mean?
Pinkerton: We don't even know.
Dr. Chinstrap: I told him not to go into the dream after his son. He should have waited for the experts to get here.
Dr. Chinstrap: Ah good, you're here.
DiCaprio: What's the sitch?!
Dr. Chinstrap: Four people, in there, all stuck in the middle one's dream.
Expert 1: We need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them!
Sharon: What next dream level?
Sharon: Why?
Sharon: What's that?
Sharon: So like a nightmare?
Sharon: Why can't you wake up from that?
Expert 1: You can, but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare!
Sharon: That doesn't sound very difficult.
Expert 1: It is!
Sharon: Why?
Expert 4: Arrgh.
Expert 1: We don't have time for this!
Sharon: Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?
Expert 1: Then we go into your husband's dreams!
Sharon: Okaaay...
DiCaprio: But your husband will think we're in Hasselback's dream.
Sharon: Okay, wait. Who's Hasselback?
Hasselback: I am.
Sharon: Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?
DiCaprio: Sometimes, thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains!
Sharon: Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?
DiCaprio: Not all the time, just this once. And maybe one other time.
Expert 1: It's so complex and cool.
Sharon: Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!
Sharon: Will they be able to wake Mackey up?
Dr. Chinstrap: If they don't, it'll be the end of Europe as we know it.
Sharon: Why?
Dr. Chinstrap: Because.
Ranger Pete: Hello kids, my name is Ranger Pete.
Class: Hi Ranger Pete.
Mackey: Hi Ranger Pete, m'kay.
Ranger Pete: Today we're gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem.
Mackey: Oh boy! Woodsy Owl!
Stan: Who's that?
Mackey: "Give a hoot, don't pollute," m'kay.
Woodsy Owl: Hi, I'm Woodsy Owl, remindin' you all to please pick up your trash, and keep our forests clean. In the city or in the woods,
Ranger Pete: Alright kids, time to split up and go into the forest. Let's divide you all up into groups of six.
Billy: We wanna be in Mackey's group!
Mackey: Oh no, that that's m'kay. We'll uh we'll get paired with someone else uh.
Ranger Pete: That's fine. You six boys can team up and be our first group in.
DiCaprio: Is this the dream, or the dream within the dream?
Expert 2: I think it's the dream inside the Matrix inside the dream!
DiCaprio: Oh well. Just keep shooting!
Stan: What the fuck?
An Expert: Mommy? Mommy?
Dr. Chinstrap: Yes, and so that's why I called the fire department. I don't know where else to turn.
Fireman 1: But, wait, if those people got stuck in there, why wouldn't we?
Fireman 1: Like a taco within a taco?
Fire Captain: A double-decker taco supreme.
Pinkerton: Exactly. But only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels, and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other people's dreams.
Pinkerton: Because the firemen dreams aren't like dreams at all. They're more like a dream within a matrix within a dream.
Pizza Man: Somebody order a pizza?
Pinkerton: No.
Dr. Chinstrap: Probably one of them in the dream.
Pinkerton: Look, if we can get the fire department into the counselor's dream, then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels. That way we'll be in the counselor's deepest level of subconscious.
Mackey: Aaaaaah! Not again, m'kay! Aaaaaah!
Stan: Mr. Mackey, stop running!
Mackey: I know what about? I don't remember what they did. I just remember the field trip being really bad, okay.
Billy: There he is! You can't run forever!
Stan: Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
Mr. Yelman: But I literally herd sheep.
Stan: Shut up!
Mackey: Okay. Okay, I can do this. I'm just gonna stand and, and face what happens, okay?
Pizza Man: Somebody... order pizza? Pizza?
Pinkerton: Mr. Mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic.
Pinkerton: Where are we going?
Dr. Chinstrap: We need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world.
Pinkerton: You don't mean...
Freddy Krueger: Chinstrap! What happened? You run out of stoolies to do your work?
Dr. Chinstrap: Alright, look, we're in a pickle again and we need your help. Got some people trapped inside a dream.
Dr. Chinstrap: There's some good men stuck in there.
Woman: Everything all right, Fred?
Dr. Chinstrap: Wife and kids.
Freddy Krueger: No thanks to you.
Dr. Chinstrap: We need ya Fred.
Freddy Krueger: Like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the Russians?!
Dr. Chinstrap: We had a country to protect!
Freddy Krueger: Protect it yourselves this time.
Dr. Chinstrap: Dammit I'm not working for the military anymore, Krueger!
Mackey: Alright Billy, I'm not gonna let you hurt me this time, hm'kay? This time I'm gonna stand up for myself!
Stan: You can do it Mr. Mackey.
Mackey: Go ahead and do your worst, Billy. I'm facing you head-on, m'kay?
DiCaprio: Get the perimeter secure! Make sure they're dead!
Stan: What the hell?
Expert 2: We got 'em! The bad memories are dead.
Stan: Who are you people?
DiCaprio: We came here to rescue you from the bad guys in Mackey's dream.
Stan: Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
Expert 1: No. As long as the source of the drama is wiped out, the counselor can wake up.
Stan: ...So then why aren't we waking up?
Expert 2: Unless... the bullies aren't the source of the counselor's bad memory.
Mackey: Hey that's right. The bullies didn't even beat me up that day. I, I ran away from them.
Real Mackey: No Woodsy! Hmkay? Don't touch muh pee pee. No Woodsy, please. I'll give a hoot, hm'kay?
Fire Captain: What's happening?
Fire Captain: What the hell's going on?
Stan: Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
Dr. Chinstrap: Something's happening. I'm getting Bogart levels on all counter ups.
Fire Captain: Thanks, Freddy.
Freddy Krueger: If only I could have saved the sheep herder.
Dr. Chinstrap: Well, did you find the painful source of your hoarding problems, Mr. Mackey?
Mr. Mackey: I sure did.
DiCaprio: Turns out he was molested by Woodsy Owl.
Mr. Mackey: I completely blocked it from my memory, hm'kay?
Fire Captain: So, he was hoarding because when he tried to throw things away his subconscious would remember Woodsy's voice saying "Give a hoot, don't pollute" and touching his penis with his wing?
Pinkerton: Wow, that is so complex and trippy and cool!
Dr. Chinstrap: Well, now that we've uncovered Mackey's source of hoarding, we can finally move on to yours, Stan. Are you ready for your therapy?
Wendy: Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?
Stan: Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
Kyle: But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
Stan: Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
Toolshed: Why do we have to be called "Coon and Friends"?
Toolshed: We all fight crime together. How come we're just your "friends"?
All: Yeah! That's right. Extreme Avenger League!
Coon: I told you, TupperWear, Extreme Avenger League doesn't work.
TupperWear: Why not?
Coon: It's confusing! The Coon is a brand people already know.
Mosquito: Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends?
Coon: Nobody's fucking heard of you, Mosquito!
Mosquito: Have, so.
Iron Maiden: Timmeh!
Alarm: Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.
Mosquito: There's like a big fire or something in town.
News 4 Reporter: There's thought to be at least twenty people trapped inside the apartment building, and firefighters are having no luck.
Coon: My God, this is what we've been waiting for! Coon and Friends, let's head out!
Liane: Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?
Coon: Mom, you're the Coon's faithful butler! I wanna go downtown now!
Liane: All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?
Coon: Mom, don't talk to us like that! We're fucking superheroes!
Fireman: We tried gettin' in through the back; it was no good!
Fire Captain: Those people are gonna die if we don't do something!
Coon: Come on, Coon Friends!
Liane: No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!
Fire Captain: Can we try a helicopter?
Coon: All right, what seems to be the problem?
Fire Captain: Get back, kids. It isn't safe.
Coon: Whatever's happening, you need help from the Coon!
Mosquito: And friends!
Coon: Please sir, you must let us-
Liane: Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.
Coon: Shut! Up! Mom! God!
Officer: Wait. Look! Up in the sky!
Fireman: It's him! My God, it's really him!
Stan: Who's Captain Hindsight?
Fire Captain: Captain Hindsight, thank God you've come!
Captain Hindsight: What's the skinny?
Fireman: There's people trapped in that burning building, Captain Hindsight. And the fire is so massive we can't get to them.
Captain Hindsight: Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it.
Fireman: Yes, of course.
Captain Hindsight: And then you see that building to the left?
Fire Captain: Yes.
Fireman: Thank you, Captain Hindsight!
Officer: Thank youuu!
Randy: Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?
Sharon: Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.
Randy: It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
Sharon: Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.
Randy: I mean, hello!
Stan: Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
Alarm: Alert: Seriously. All Coon Friends to base. Alert, you guys. I'm seriously.
Randy: I don't know.
Sharon: Well take it down. It's noisy.
Coon: Alright, Toolshed is here. We can start.
Toolshed: Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?
Mosquito: Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it.
Coon: The Coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out.
TupperWear: So what's the huge catastrophe?
Coon: What's the huge-? Did you guys not see that Captain Hindsight guy?!
The Human Kite: Yeah, so?
Coon: So there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's NOT part of Coon and Friends!
Toolshed: Oh Jesus...
Coon: You aren't going anywhere, Chaos!
Mysterion: Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?
Coon: I CARE!
Mysterion: Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.
Coon: There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?!
BP Man 1: All right, this looks like a jolly good place.
BP Man 3: Oh, don't tell me we did it again?
Reporter: It's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe. Oil from the ocean is spill out out of control, and the rescue effort seems futile.
Man: It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.
Woman: Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?
Cajun Shrimper: Git a lookie on mah scrimp heuh! Might as give ya the best scrimp this side of Louisiana and now down tuh where we all got up in our scrimp, and it ain't worth a slimy noob it ain't sold on. There, now lookit all the url on mah scrimp!
Mysterion: My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!
The Human Kite: We've got to help those people!
Coon: Yes. This is definitely a job for Coon and Friends.
Coon: Oh no!
Captain Hindsight: What seems to be the problem?
Rescuer 2: It's that BP Oil rig, Captain Hindsight. It drilled into a marine sanctuary and the environment is being poisoned.
Rescuer 3: If we can't stop it, the spill could reach New Orleans.
Rescuer 3: Yes.
Captain Hindsight: It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill!
Rescuer 2: Aha!
Rescuer 4: Yesss, YESSS.
Captain Hindsight: Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke.
Rescuer 2: I believe they did install a backup safety valve, Captain Hindsight.
Rescuer 5: My God, he's right!
Captain Hindsight: My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need!
Rescuer 4: God bless you, Captain Hindsight! God bless you!!
Coon: Goddammit! We have got to get that guy into Coon and Friends!
Cartman: I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
Butler: Yes?
Cartman: I need to speak with him, please.
Butler: The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.
Cartman: I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
Captain Hindsight: Please, sit down. What can I do for you?
Cartman: I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
Captain Hindsight: Go ahead.
Officer 2: The oil keeps coming out! We've got other rigs now catching fire!
Captain Hindsight: Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened.
Fireman 2: Captain Hindsight! The dolphins that those volunteers cleaned of oil, they, they're all dying!
Captain Hindsight: Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner!
Commissioner: Yes?
Captain Hindsight: Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone.
Cartman: Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
Captain Hindsight: Get this kid out of here! I have to think!
Anchor Man: The BP Oil spill in the Gulf continues to get worse every day. As public anger towards the BP Company grows, their president released this statement:
Toolshed: How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?
Professor Chaos: Me?? Awww, come on, fellas, don't make me be Courtney Love.
Coon: Gotta get to work fast, people! Coon and Friends, ho!
Mosquito: ...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like.
Coon: That's because you think small, Mosquito! You have a tiny little mosquito brain, that's why you don't come up with the plan!
Mosquito: Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero.
Mysterion: Agreed.
Coon: Oh who cares about some oil spill environment crap?!
Toolshed: Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!
Coon: You don't know that I'm Cartman because my true identity is secret!
Mysterion: We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!
Mosquito: I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale.
Mosquito: I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people.
Coon: We're superheroes, not the fucking Girl Scouts!
Mysterion: Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.
Iron Maiden: Timmeh!
Mint-Berry Crunch: More helpful than taking naked pictures of Butters.
Coon: Shut up, Mint-Berry Crunch! You aren't even anything!
Mosquito: And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch!
Coon: Oh, what are you, the boss now?!
Toolshed: To the grocery store!
Captain Hindsight: I can't help anyone right now! Something came up.
Butler: What, sir? You know you can tell me.
Captain Hindsight: Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk?
Butler: Yes sir.
Butler: My God, is that you and... Courtney Love?
Captain Hindsight: 'Course it's Courtney Love!
Butler: But when did you have a-
Captain Hindsight: I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening!
Butler: That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done!
Captain Hindsight: I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-
Butler: Sir! SIR!
Reporter: Creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the Gulf, and the question everyone is asking is, "Where is Captain Hindsight?"
Rescuer 6: Where are you, Captain Hindsight?
Cajun Shrimper: Where are d'you countih ninety-oh bebbly now is showmesitchcum.
Reporter: With Captain Hindsight missing, what superheroes can save the Gulf now?
Coon: My fellow superheroes, I have done it. Hindsight is taken care of. And now the country can finally be made aware of Coon and Friends!
Toolshed: There's more important things to discuss right now!
Coon: Right, Toolshed. Now, how do we deal with these creatures from another dimension?
Mysterion: He means we need to discuss things with you!
Coon: Okay, what?
Mysterion: Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!
TupperWear: I don't wanna tell him either.
The Human Kite: I'll tell him. Coon, I'm sorry, but we're kicking you out of Coon and Friends.
Coon: You're kicking me out of Coon and Friends.
Toolshed: We all voted, it was unanimous.
Coon: You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon!
The Human Kite: Look, we just believe that you have your goals and ways of doing things and they conflict with what we want to accomplish.
Mysterion: But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.
Coon: You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys!
Liane: Yes, Mysterion?
Mysterion: Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.
Coon: Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!
DP Executive 1: Oh dear, we have certainly pooped our trousers this time!
Tony Hayward: Yes, I'm afraid it's going to take more than another "I'm sorry" campaign to please everyone this time.
DP Executive 3: There is no way to cut the dimensional portal, I'm afraid. The ocean currents and swells are simply too much to get any machines in.
DP Executive 4: How, by Jove?
Tony Hayward: We drill.
DP Executives: Drill of course, yes, yes, of course.
Tony Hayward: I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill.
DP Executive 5: I don't quite get it.
DP Executive 6: That looks extremely promising!
Tony Hayward: Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time.
DP Executive 6: The seismic forces will be massive. Do you think the moon can take it?
Anchor Man: The DP Oil Company today drilled into the moon and appears to have caused even greater problems.
Stan: Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.
Reporter: Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. Praise the dark Cthulhu, long may he reign.
Mysterion: But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.
Mysterion: Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.
Woman 1: Just terrific what you boys are doing.
Mysterion: Thank you, ma'am.
Field Reporter: A terrific human interest story here, Tom. As America wonders what happened to Captain Hindsight, some Colorado kids are being a little "superhuman" themselves. They call themselves "Coon and Friends," and they've been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the Gulf crisis.
Mysterion: We believe that every little bit helps.
Toolshed: Toolshed!
Human Kite: The Human Kite!
Mysterion: Mysterion!
TupperWear: TupperWear!
Mosquito: Mosquito!
Iron Maiden: Timmah!
Toolshed: Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?
Clerk: Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour.
Passengers: Awwww!
Blonde Girl: The Coon? I've heard of that.
Coon: Ya have?
Blonde Girl: I saw on TV. That superhero group that's helping with the Gulf spill. Coon and Friends.
Coon: Actually, I'm no longer with Coon and Friends. I work on my own now.
Blonde Girl: Can I ask you a question?
Coon: Yes, of course.
Mosquito: That's almost it, superheroes. We're about out of lemon bars.
Toolshed: Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more!
Man 2: I'll take ten lemon bars.
Human Kite: That's definitely the last of them.
Mosquito: Stop who?
Toolshed: The Necronomicon?
TupperWear: What's a mythos?
Mysterion: I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.
Toolshed: All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!
Mint-Berry Crunch: Mint-Berry Crrunch!
TupperWear: What the hell?!
Mosquito: I knew it! Cartman tore our base up!
Mysterion: Not Cartman.
Human Kite: What do you mean "Not Cartman," dude?
Mysterion: Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.
Toolshed: Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight.
Captain Hindsight: I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!
Toolshed: Um dude, are you okay?
Mint-Berry Crunch: P-p-please sir, w-we don't know what you mean.
Professor Chaos: Uhhh ohhh...
Mysterion: Chaos! Why did you take those pictures?!
Professor Chaos: But uh, but, but the Coon said if I took the pictures he, he'd let me go home and, and I've missed four days of school now 'cause I've been-
Captain Hindsight: Alright enough! What's going on?!
Mysterion: Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!
Captain Hindsight: It's not Courtney Love?
Mysterion: Please sir, put down the gun.
Captain Hindsight: No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?!
Toolshed: Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.
Captain Hindsight: NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all!
Human Kite: Dude, Kenny, ch-chill out.
Mysterion: You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!
Human Kite: My mom did tell me I had to be home by five, I-
Captain Hindsight: Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?!
Captain Hindsight: Wha-? What is your power?
Announcer: And now, a special announcement from the president of BP and DP.
Toolshed: All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing!
Mosquito: Right, Toolshed!
Human Kite: Here we go: "The Necronomicon contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them."
Toolshed: "It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu."
Mint-Berry Crunch: Aha! That's the cult the creepy man talked about, heroes. Uh, you okay, Mysterion?
Human Kite: Ten arrested in South Park for cultish activity. This is from like, ten years ago.
Mysterion: So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.
Human Kite: Hey wait a minute. Dude. Mysterion, it's your parents.
Stuart: 'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!
Stuart: Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.
Mysterion: I'm not here about that.
Stuart: Oh. Uhuh, sss-so now what?
Mysterion: Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.
Stuart: We've been arrested lots of times, Mysterio.
Stuart: Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.
Mysterion: What happened at those meetings?
Stuart: Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.
Mysterion: I don't find that hard to believe at all.
Mrs. McCormick: I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited.
Mysterion: These people still meet? Where?
Stuart: Where they always did. Jim McElroy's house.
Field Reporter: Breaking news here in the Gulf, Tom. The dark ancient god Cthulhu has called for a press conference, The Old One told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news.
Coon: Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of Cthulhu, and the Coon. Cthulhu's track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question. And now, coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of The Coon, we intend to bring change and fight injustice. As the all-new Coon and Friends. And anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law! Oh, what's that? There is another group using our trademarked name? Well, I guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion, don't we?!
Mysterion: There must be clubs like this all over the world.
Toolshed: We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys.
Human Kite: Oh my God, look! Back row. Aren't those the Goth kids?
Pete: I'm so freaking stoked that Cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists.
Michael: Yeah. I just hope he puts an end to the fucking Disney Channel.
Toolshed: Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?
Mysterion: Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.
Cult Leader: Now let us read from the Necronomicon. "That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons"
Toolshed: "In strange aeons even Death may die?" What does that mean, Human Kite?
Mint-Berry Crunch: Mysterion is sooo... mysterious.
Jack Brolin: A horrific scene of destruction, despair and terror here in New Orleans. And still there's no sign of Captain Hindsight. Rumor has it he got sick of it all, went back to his chair, and removed all his powers.
Jack Brolin: Perhaps... he shouldn't have gotten back in that chair...
Michael: No, assmunch. Cthulhu just wants chaos, bedlam, and madness.
Mysterion: What does it mean?!
Pete: It means Cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff. It's gonna be like, a Nine Inch Nails concert that goes on forever.
Michael: Yeah, so go home and put your underwear back inside your pants, poser.
Michael: Dude, that little kid is hardcore goth.
Pete: Hardcore goth.
Pete: Whaaat? Dude, I don't wanna kill anybody.
Michael: We're dark lord minions now, wuss. What'd you think we'd be doing?
Coon: Yeeheah!
Coon: Yeah, fuck all o'you!
Coon: Lick my balls!
Coon: Suck it, bitches!
Toolshed: Toolshed!
TupperWear: TupperWear!
Human Kite: Human Kite!
Toolshed: Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you!
Toolshed: Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!
Toolshed: Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!
Mosquito: Yeah, come on, get your costume on, lazy-ass!
Mintberry Crunch: Rrright!
Human Kite: But then what exactly is your superpower?
Mintberry Crunch: The power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch!
Toolshed: ...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-
Human Kite: nd shoot lasers out of my eyes.
Toolshed: ...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-
Mysterion: No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!
Toolshed: ...Woo-hat?
Mysterion: All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!
Toolshed: ...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.
Mysterion: Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!
Mintberry Crunch: Nono. Mintberry Crunch doesn't ever pee his pants!
Toolshed: Kenny Kenny, calm down.
Toolshed: Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!
Human Kite: Dude!
Coon: Hi Mom.
Liane: Where have you been, young man?!
Coon: Just doin' stuff Mom. Are my friends downstairs in the secret base?
Liane: Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!
Liane: Eric, are you listening to me?!
Coon: What should I do? Should I admit I made mistakes? Should I say I've done this before? Should I write a song about how I should have stayed in my room? What should I do?
Liane: What do you mean "what should-"
Coon: Should I say I am not a role model? Should I not listen to my conscience? It's my conscience, Mom! What should I do? Go back to my room and pretend nothing happened? Not jump out the window and fly to New Orleans? What should I do, Ma? Tell me!
Human Kite: Alright Coon and Friends, what good deed should we do next?
Mosquito: Perhaps we should make more lemon bars to raise money for people in need.
TupperWear: Okay!
Mysterion: You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you?
Toolshed: Uh-what?
Mysterion: What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.
Human Kite: Yeah cool let's talk about where our powers come from.
Mosquito: I was bitten by a radioactive mosquito! Bzzzzzzt.
TupperWear: I was in a car accident, then put back together with Tupperware parts.
Iron Maiden: Tih-Timmieh!
Mysterion: iill you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!
Toolshed: Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?
Coon: No, I, I know. That's cool, I understand. Even though I started it and the secret base is in my house. Yes, that's totally understandable.
Human Kite: You just wanted to frame and blackmail people, then you beat up Clyde and Bradley for no reason!
Coon: No you're right. For no reason. Clearly something is wrong with me. But you guys, what should I do?
Human Kite: You should fuck off, that's what you should do.
Mintberry Crunch: A what?
Coon: Isn't it beautiful you guys?
Human Kite: There's no double rainbow, fatass!
Coon: You are correct, Human Kike! Not that supervillains like you guys could ever see a double rainbow!
Mosquito: What are you talking about?
Coon: Your evil-doing days are over, Mosquito! All of you shall now be dealt the swift hand of justice!
Human Kite: Cartman, you are the bad guy, not us!
Mysterion: What are you doing with that thing?!
Coon: He's going to help me get rid of you guys so together we can make the world a better place!
Human Kite: Cartman, if you team up with the most evil thing in the universe, then clearly you are the bad guy!
Coon: No, because it's for the greater good, like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor!
Human Kite: Superman never teamed up with Lex Luthor!
Toolshed: Dude, where the fuck are we?
Mintberry Crunch: And so, the Coon had returned with the dark lord Cthulhu! Upon seeing Cthulhu in person, Mintberry Crunch heroically dashed off, to, to save the day! With Minty coolness he hurried back home! And heroically watched Judge Judy, knowing that his superhero friends were probably just fine without him!
Toolshed: Oh shit!
Mosquito: You guys, I wanna go home.
Toolshed: We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here.
Mosquito: Look, maybe we should just a place to hid and wait for help.
Human Kite: What help, dude? Nobody in the real world even knows we're here.
Toolshed: How, dude?
Human Kite: Kenny, where the hell are you going?
Toolshed: Oh my God! Kenny!
Reporter: The dark and evil Cthulhu is bringing his angry wrath down upon the Burning Man Festival, Tom. Cthulhu isn't behaving as most scientists had speculated, Tom, but the dark lord is wreaking havoc everywhere and-
Reporter: Tom, it appears that Bruce Vilanch has arrived on the scene wearing a rat costume.
Michael: This freaking sucks! We worshiped and prayed to Cthulhu, went to all the cult meetings, but life is still totally freaking gay.
Pete: I thought that when Cthulhu rose from the dead all was gonna be darkness and pain. I thought at least school would be canceled.
Michael: Oh joy, it's Underwear Boy again.
Mysterion: That god you pray to just took away all my friends.
Mysterion: How do I fight him?!
Pete: Cthulhu isn't alive or dead, alright?
Mrs. Biggle: Henrietta, your little brother wants to play with you.
Henrietta: Go away Mom, I hate you.
Bradley: Will you guys play with me?
Henrietta: Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!
Mysterion: One Ones?
Michael: Dark deities that existed before man.
Henrietta: It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension.
Mysterion: That's it! That's the place I just was!
Michael: You've been to the nightmare city of R'Lyeh?
Pete: Luckyyy...
Henrietta: Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world.
Mysterion: And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?
Mintberry Crunch: Ahaaa! Don't worry, Mysterion. Mintberry Crunch is here to help you with these black cultists!
Henrietta: Get out of my room, TWERP!
Mysterion: Wherever Cthulhu is!
Mintberry Crunch: What? But he'll kill you.
Mysterion: Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers.
Mintberry Crunch: Oh right. Maybe I can find the reason for my powers too.
Mysterion: You don't understand!
Coon: After the triumphant victory over the evil hippies of Burning Man, Coon and Friends turned their attention to the next villainous scourge, bravely taking out every Whole Foods left in the country! No more organic crap for America! Thanks to Coon and Friends the country would soon be rid of all evil, but first, they would come up against their most challenging and most evil opponent, Justin Bieber. In order to save the Earth, this little butthole had to be stopped.
Reporter 2: The dark god Cthulhu continues his rampage of destruction and terror, and there seems to be no hope for man. I'm joined now by a supposed team member of Cthulhu, the Coon.
Coon: It isn't just Cthulhu, Mr. Reporter. He's merely a small piece of Coon and Friends, who will continue to fight for good and justice.
Reporter 2: Good and justice? J-Justin Bieber and most of his fans have just been massacred.
Coon: Yes, Coon and Friends are happy to help. We do not need thanks for our deeds. We do not want gifts, all we want is for people to buy our Coon and Friends T-Shirts for $14.95.
Mysterion: Hey, fat boy!
Coon: Kenny? What the hell? I sent you to the-
Coon: It's not my fault you guys turned evil, Kenny!
Mysterion: You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!
Coon: I'm going around making the world a better place!
Mysterion: For you! You're making it a better place for you!
Coon: Right, that's what superheroes do.
Mysterion: Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!
Mysterion: No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back!
Coon: Fuck you, Kenny!
Alien Man: Hello my son. If you are seeing this message, then it must be dark times. And you must have many questions. Your true name is Gok'Zarah. The power given to you comes from a planet far away. You are from that planet, Gok'Zarah. It is for that reason you have a power that normal humans do not have. I know you must sometimes see this power as a curse, but you were sent here to stop evil from taking over the Earth and now, that time has apparently come. You must now harness and focus your power, Gok'Zarah. The power of mint and berries yet with a tasty, satisfying crunch.
Mintberry Crunch: ...Uh yes. Yes, please go on.
Alien Man: Your home planet, K'oh Kajan, is known throughout the universe for its berry mines. Berries that have the power to fuel nearly anything. Needless to say, when the mint hunters of Kogenrah got word of them, our fate was already sealed, Gok'Zarah. But our two worlds collided and soon, mint and berry were one.
Mintberry Crunch: Wow!
Toolshed: Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mintberry Crunch.
Mintberry Crunch: Oh no, we worked as a team! All the Coon and Friends stopped the BP drilling spill crisis.
Coon: Come on you guys, this is fucking bullcrap! Let me out!
Human Kite: You're not going anywhere for a long time!
Coon: This is inhumane! There's a big bucket with Butters' poop in here, and there's nothing to eat!
Toolshed: Ya got poop, don't ya?
Mintberry Crunch: Well, I'm off. There are still many more questions left unanswered. I need to know what happened to my parents.
Human Kite: Well, come back and visit any time, dude.
Coon: Fuckin' Mintberry fuckin' Crunch.
Toolshed: Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?
Toolshed: Oh my God! Holy shit dude!
Human Kite: Kenny? No! Nooo!
Stuart: What? Whaaat?!
Reporter: Passenger said the Carnival cruise line smelled like poop, but that that was an improvement.
Randy: Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.
Sharon: Alright, come to bed soon.
Randy: Mmm, God damn. Yeah.
Randy: Yeah, it's fuckin' money.
Paula Deen: Hey y'all. Tonight we're gonna be makin' some deep-fried chicken.
Randy: Aw yeah?
Paula Deen: Muh buttery whipped potatoes and we're gonna be finishin' off with a chocolate pecan pie.
Stan: Dad, what are you doing?
Randy: Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!
Randy: No!
Sharon: Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.
Stan: Can I have a Pop Tart?
Kyle: Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
Alton Brown: Now just look at this pork tenderloin. It is brined and ready for action.
Randy: Aw yeah, look at that.
Stan: Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
Randy: I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
Alton Brown: We're gonna take a stick of butter and just smear that all over.
Alton Brown: Now let's get that on the grill.
Randy: See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.
Alton Brown: Look at the char we're getting. That, that is what we're going for.
Announcer: We'll be right back to Good Eats.
Woman 1: Hey ladies, are you looking for a better workout?
Woman 1: Introducing the Shake Weight. A spring-loaded workout device you pump with your arms. Just grab the piston and go to work. One-handed or double-fisted.
Woman 1: You just shake it. Back and forth.
Woman 2: It feels really good in my hands.
Randy: Bohh-riiing.
Announcer: Now back to Good Eats.
Alton Brown: Just look at the glaze we've got going now on that thing.
Parental Controls: /center></poem>
Sharon: Just using the parental controls to block some channels.
Randy: I wasn't watching food channels!
Sharon: Then how do you know I blocked them?
Hotline Man: Thanks for calling the Food Network Hotline. Billing is nine-ninety-five for each sixty-second period. To accept, say "crme frache."
Randy: Crme frache.
Amanda: Hi there, I'm Amanda. What are you up to?
Randy: Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?
Amanda: I'm making a pan-roasted chicken.
Amanda: Uh huh. I've just taken the chicken out of the pan. It's... so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes.
Randy: Yeah?
Amanda: Yeah. Ooo, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet.
Randy: You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?
Amanda: Oh I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me?
Randy: If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
Randy: Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
Amanda: I was thinking about shallots, actually.
Randy: Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
Sharon: Randy! Marsh!
Randy: WAH! Sharon!
Hotline Man: Your time on Food Network Hotline has expired. To add more time say "crme frache."
Sharon: I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambing a pork chop.
Sheila: Sharon, I'm so sorry.
Sharon: It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all.
Sheila: Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.
Sharon: Like I have time to go to the gym every day.
Sheila: There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?
Sharon: Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?
Michael: Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at?
Sharon: Oh I didn't realize there were different models.
Sharon: I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.
Sharon: Well I don't know-
Michael: I would definitely recommend the voice assist. It has recorded voice commands to help motivate you in your workout.
Sharon: Thank you, Shake Weight.
Sharon: Hahhh.
Sharon: Oh wow.
Stan: You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
Randy: Hello there, children!
Stan: Awww what?!
Stan: No, dad! No!
Randy: The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
Stan: Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
Randy: I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crme frache.
Randy: Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.
Stan: Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
Stan: Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
Sharon: Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!
Stan: Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
Shake Weight: This is a workout reminder. Time for a workout.
Shake Weight: That's it. Work it. Harder, faster.
Stan: Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!
Shake Weight: You are independent and strong.
Sharon: Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!
Shake Weight: Switch arms.
Stan: Dad, what are you doing?
Randy: Frache.
Stan: Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
Randy: Quiet on set, please.
Stan: No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!
Sharon: Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this.
Shake Weight: You are so lovely and elegant. You can do anything you set your mind to.
Sharon: Oh, thanks Shake Weight.
Shake Weight: You are a go-getter. You are strong and confident.
Sharon: You're right.
Shake Weight: Tell me again about the women who you do not like.
Sharon: Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.
Shake Weight: Just a quickie. You can do it.
Sharon: I don't really like working out in public.
Kyle: We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
Stan: He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
Kyle: He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
Stan: That's stupid, Cartman.
Kyle: He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
Kenny: (Yeah, it's really good.)
Kyle: Let's hear it, Cartman!
Cartman: Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
Stan: You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
Stan: ...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
Randy: Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!
Shake Weight: You have not worked out in seven hours.
Sharon: Oh God, not right now.
Shake Weight: Come on. Let's get to it.
Sharon: Ugh, I'm tired.
Shake Weight: You have not worked out in seven hours.
Sharon: Oh, where is that sleep mode button?
Shake Weight: Cannot go to sleep mode. You need to work out first. Come on. Just really fast?
Sharon: Ugghh.
Shake Weight: Come on. It won't take long. Just a quick workout. Come on. Please.
Randy: Yes chef!
Cartman: Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
Stan: Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
Randy: No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!
Bobby Flay: Uh, excuse me. Randy Marsh?
Randy: Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!
Bobby Flay: I heard that Gordon Ramsay had taken an interest in your cafeteria food. So now I would like to challenge you to a school cafeteria food throwdown!
Announcer: A culinary battle royale is set to explode here in a school cafeteria. Will it be the simple, rustic cafeteria food of the challenger, or will the Iron Chef reign supreme?
Stan: Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
Randy: Jamie Oliver!
Kyle: Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
Shake Weight: This is ridiculous. Give Shake Weight a break.
Sharon: Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.
Shake Weight: You are enticing and lovely. Tell me again about the women you do not like.
Sharon: I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!
Announcer: Tonight, a school cafeteria in Middle America is the stage for a heavyweight culinary battle. The very best of the best will cook off to find out who... can make the best school cafeteria food. It's... the Hell's Kitchen Nightmares Iron Top Chef Cafeteria Throwdown Ultimate Cookoff Challenge!
Announcer: And back in the kitchen the challenger appears to have lost something.
Announcer: The challenger has left the cafeteria to find his most important ingredient.
Sharon: Randy, we should talk.
Randy: I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
Sharon: Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?
Randy: You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!
Sharon: What'd you say?
Sharon: Can I try something?
Sharon: You gonna go back to the kitchen?
Randy: Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?
Shake Weight: I guess my work here is finished.
Sharon: Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?
Shake Weight: Marriage is important. Keep your man happy. When things are going bad, there's nothing like an old-fashioned to ease his stress.
Sharon: I'll remember that now, thanks to you.
Shake Weight: It has been nice getting to know you. How about a quick workout, for old times' sake? Just kidding. I must be going now. Another lovely woman needs me. Goodbye, customer.
Sharon: Goodbye, Shake Weight.
Craig: Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.
Stan: Let me see your iPad, Cartman.
Cartman: Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! [Craig looks off into the distance, surprised]
Kyle: Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.
Cartman: No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
Kyle: So, plug it in.
Cartman: Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
Kyle: You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.
Kyle: What? Ready for what?
Apple Man 2: 83 pounds, sir.
Kyle: What "agreement"?!
Apple Man 1: 83 pounds, good. Let's get the bloodwork.
Apple Man 1: You agreed we could take all the blood we needed.
Kyle: What are you talking about?!
Apple Man 1: When you downloaded the last iTunes update a window on your screen popped up and asked you if you agreed to our terms and conditions. You clicked "Agree." Alright, let's get him to the water tank.
Stan: What?
Kyle: It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!
Stan: Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
Kyle: I don't know, I didn't read them!
Butters: You didn't read them?
Kyle: Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
Clyde: Me too.
Kyle: You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?
Jimmy: Of course.
Butters: Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
Apple Man 1: There he is. Hey you!
Kyle: Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!
Gerald: Kyle? What are you doing here?
Kyle: Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!
Gerald: Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.
Kyle: But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
Apple Man 1: Here he is!
Kyle: AAHH!
Apple Man 1: Come on you!
Gerald: Hey, what the heck is going on?
Apple Man 1: Your son has made a binding and legal agreement with Apple, sir.
Gerald: An agreement to do what?!
Apple Man 1: Apple's inner workings are top secret to all users. You know how it is.
Apple Man 4: Come on, let's go!
Kyle: Dad! You tasered my dad!
Apple Man 1: You said we could.
Cartman: Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
Liane: Oh, sweetie, $900?
Cartman: I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
Liane: Eric, we can't afford that one.
Cartman: Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
Liane: I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.
Cartman: Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
Cartman: Toshiba Handibook??
Liane: This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price!
Cartman: Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
Liane: Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!
Liane: Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!
Liane: You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those PEOPLE!
Cartman: I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
Liane: Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say "Help! Help! My mom is trying to fuck me!"?!
Liane: If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting ANYTHING!!
Liane: NO!!
Woman: What are you going to do to us??
Kyle: What is this? What's going on?
Woman: You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??
Kyle: ...What?
Woman: I just clicked "Agree." I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!
Junichi: (In Japanese Accent) I can't even read Engrish!
Kyle: Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
Guard: You can't agree by accident. There's a fail-safe built in. Even if you click on "Agree" another little window pops up that says "Are you sure you agree?" and you have to click on "Agree" again.
Woman: Uh, what are you going to do to us??
Guard: Everything that you agreed to in the iTunes conditions.
Kyle: We didn't read them!
Kyle: The first what?
Woman: What??
Junichi: (In Japanese Accent) Oho... I should habu never appudeitedo iTunes!
Butters: "You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."
Gerald: Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!
Stan: We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
Gerald: There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
Butters: Hold up. Here it is right here: "by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"
Stan: Oh boy.
Butters: "Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract." Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... "Decline."
Gerald: Well that does it! I'm going to the police!
Stan: For what?
Gerald: To find out where Apple is keeping my son!
Stan: Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
Butters: The Geniuses...
Kenny: (The Geniuses...)
Kyle: (I can't take it! I want out right now!)
Steve Jobs: Yeah you want out? Are you saying you want out?
Kyle: (Yes! Please! Let me go!)
Apple Tech: It's probably low on power. We should feed it.
Steve Jobs: We have to unveil this thing tomorrow. It better be reading by then!
Junichi: (In Japanese Accent) Oh, oh no... feel sick...
Kyle: (You're fine!)
Woman: (Aaaaaah!)
Announcer: Today, on Dr. Phil. The tragic story of a little boy whose mother constantly tries to fuck him.
Dr. Phil: I want you all to meet Eric Cartman, who's a very special boy with a very hard life. Eric, you say that your mom fucks you?
Cartman: Yes! She fucks me so hard!
Dr. Phil: Does this happen often? Does she- does she fuck you a lot?
Cartman: Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
Audience: Ohhh...
Dr. Phil: Now, I know this is very difficult for you to talk about, but... where was the last time your mother fucked you?
Cartman: At Best Buy.
Audience: Ahhh...
Dr. Phil: Your mother fucked you at Best Buy?
Cartman: Uh huh.
Dr. Phil: And people saw her doing this?
Cartman: Yes!
Dr. Phil: And they didn't do anything?
Cartman: No!
Audience: Booooooo!
Cartman: Booooooo!
Liane: Eric, you come home, right now!
Audience: Booooooo!
Dr. Phil: Ma'am, why do you think it's okay to fuck your son?
Liane: I DON'T!
Cartman: She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
Cartman: You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
Man 1: You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!
Dr. Phil: Well Eric, we have a very special gift we wanna give you.
Announcer: Gerald Broflovski.
Leslie: Hi, my name is Leslie. I'll be your Genius.
Stan: Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
Leslie: What problems are you experiencing?
Gerald: My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!
Leslie: Oh-kay, well I'm sorry you're having trouble with that today. Could I have his Apple ID?
Gerald: No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!
Frothgar: 'Kay, this says he agreed to be taken and made part of any experiments Apple wants to perform.
Stan: Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
Butters: We know. It's preposterous.
Leslie: Sooo, just give them store credit?
Kyle: (Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!)
Junichi: (In Japanese Accent) Cuttlefish and asparagus?
Kyle: (No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
Rescuer 1: Come on, hurry! We have an ambulance waiting outside.
Rescuer 1: Just try to stay calm. We're gonna have to try and get you separated right away!
Junichi: (In Japanese Accent) Yes, please hurry! That cuttlefish and asparagus is noto sitting well.
Rescuer 1: We got it! We got it! Doctor, can you take this thing apart?!
Junichi: (In Japanese Accent) Oh no! Cuttlefish is about to come out ofu asshole!
Kyle: (Oh, shit!)
Frothgar: Yeap. A-and then you should be able to do a customer check, uh huh.
Leslie: Okay, that should do it. Sorry Apple kidnapped your friend, guys. But I believe we have it all cleared up.
Gerald: You do??
Leslie: Yeah, we got you a replacement friend. You should be all good to go.
Replacement Friend: Hi guys.
Leslie: Yeah, I think we should have a quickening, with all the Geniuses.
Frothgar: I'll summon the council.
Leslie: Okay, if you guys just wait here a sec we're gonna have a quickening with the Council of Geniuses. See what we can do for you.
Leslie: Do you know if your friend has a Verizon or AT&T mobile number associated with his dot-me account?
Stan: I think Verizon.
Field Reporter: Tom, it's a big exciting day for Mac Apple users: the unveiling of the first HumancentiPad. As part of a clear PR stunt, Apple has joined up with Best Buy and Dr. Phil to donate the first centiPad to a needy boy who was raped by his mother.
Crowd: Yaaaaaaaaay!
Reporter 1: Yes but, can it read?
Kyle: (Yes. I promise I'll read.)
Crowd: Hooraaaaaaaaay!
Gerald: What the hell are they doing now?!
Butters: The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
Gerald: Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-
Leslie: It's okay, sir. The Toran Ra has revealed the answer to your problem. We can retroactively make your son's agreement invalid.
Gerald: Okay! Finally! How do we do that?
Leslie: It's very easy. You will simply need to join Apple.
Leslie: But if you join we can make your son's account into a family account, and then you have to iApprove all his agreements.
Stan: Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?
Gerald: Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.
Leslie: Gerald Broflovski, do you agree to let Apple track your location at all times?
Leslie: Do you agree to give Apple access to all your personal information, including but not limited to your favorite movies, songs, and books?
Gerald: I agree.
Leslie: Do you agree to care about your membership, and prove that you care by purchasing AppleCare?
Cartman: Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
Steve Jobs: What? What do you mean we have to take it apart?! The boy's agreement isn't valid?
Staffer 2: Sorry, we have to recall this.
Cartman: What?! Hey, that's mine!
Steve Jobs: I don't care what the Geniuses say! Dammit, I'm trying to create the future here!
Steve Jobs: You know something? I agree.
Cartman: What's this?
Jimmy: Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show.
Kyle: Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.
Jimmy: Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?
Stan: Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
Kyle: Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.
Stan: Oh man, really?
Jimmy: Wow, this is the greatest day of my life. Thanks everyone, for this incredible award.
Stan: Can we go now?
Jimmy: Go? We still have over fifty awards to hand out.
Crowd: Awww!
Token: Oh God, how embarrassing.
Tyler Perry: Good afternoont! Halloer! I'd also really like to thank my-
Jimmy: I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry.
Jimmy: I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!
Ryan: Mnn. Mhm.
Jimmy: Dad, I'm really feeling sad and let down right now, and I feel like I can't even get a response from you. Could I at the very least please just get a what what-what?
Ryan: What. Uh, what?!
Jimmy: Thanks, Dad.
Sarah: Jimmy! They're talking about your comedy awards! On the national news!
Anchor: A school in Colorado has declared Germans the least funny people in the world. The first annual comdey awards were held by the schoolchildren yesterday, and all of Germany is outraged.
Pianist: Welcome, O Welcome to our little play. It's our hope that you all learn something today.
Tooth: I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
Toothbrush: I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
Toothbrush: His name is Toothuhkay.
Dental Floss: He's not here.
Mr. Mackey: What do you mean he's not here?
Dental Floss: He's at home watching the royal wedding.
Mr. Mackey: The what??
Hard Candy: He said he had to watch it.
Mr. Mackey: Is this some kind of joke? We are two weeks into tent rehearsals! Who the heck would sit at home watching the royal wedding?!
Tooth: I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
Toothbrush: I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
Dental Floss: Oh no! It's Tooth Decay.
Tooth: He's gonna get us.
Suicide 1: The prinness is gone! AAAAAH!
Suicide 2: AAAAAH!
Suicide 3: AAAAAH!
Suicide 4: AAAAAH!
Suicide 5: AAAAAH!
Suicide 6: AAAAAH!
Anchor: A massive candlelight vigil was held last night, led by the Canadian band, Rush.
Geddy Lee: And it seems to me you lived your life like a flower breaking wind. [farts. Members of the crowd begin killing themselves] Never knowing whom to count on... [Alex Lifeson shoots himself in the head. The singer breaks down and cries]
Mr. Garrison: Dialog
Mr. Mackey: How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of dental hygiene without Tooth Decay?! We have two more days of tape, and then previews start on Monday! What am I supposed to do, Kyle?! You tell me!
Kyle: Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?
Tooth: I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
Toothbrush: I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
Kyle: I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
Kyle: I'm just doing the line.
Mr. Mackey: The audience is supposed to feel scared of tooth decay, Kyle! Hukay?! If Tooth Decay has no believability, then Tooth Past and Dental Floss have nothing to play against!
Kyle: Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.
Leader: Brave Canadians! You have answered the call, and now we must face our greatest foe! The princess has been kidnapped, and we believe this to be the work of... the giant!
Ugly Bob: Oh, the giant!
Canadian 1: Oh, the giant, that's not good.
The Giant: Fee fi fo fum! I smell Kraft dinner.
Canadian 2: It's the giant!
Leader: Give us back the princess, Scott!
Scott: You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!
Leader: You're a dick, Scott! You have always been... a dick! And then you got radiation poisoning in Ottowa and now you're a giant dick!
Scott: No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!
Leader: Just hand over the princess of Canada!
Scott: Why would I take the princess of Canada?
Ike: Because you're a giant dick.
Scott: I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!
Ugly Bob: Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh?
Scott: What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!
Ugly Bob: Who?
Scott: The Native Canadians.
Ugly Bob: The Native Canadians?
Scott: There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.
Male: Etiach kedni i kia ta po
Female: Dichila enjunako o achla
Scott: Fart-loving eskimos! I'm sure they've taken the princess! Just look at them! Loudmouthed self-centered assholes!
Female: Tolato'n jenako o ach
Male: Ota-a kiednia unshke tia
Mr. Mackey: Wokay, in fifteen fucking minutes you all are not gonna care about this anymore, so I'll just say what I need to say. That was the worst rehearsal we have ever had! We are two days away from opening and you're all fuckin' around!
Dental Floss: That's because Tooth Decay sucks.
Dentist: Yeah, that's right.
Toothpaste: It's all Tooth Decay's fault.
Another kindergartner: It's him.
Group: Lechambik leeushtula.
Group: Aaaaaah
Ugly Bob: He says that the taking of the princess was foretold.
Male: Iyach danich Iyahachdashey. Etiapo kitte kihine.
Ugly Bob: He says Eskimos do hate us Canadians, but that there's an even bigger thread to Canada who has the princess.
Male: Oteacha hiya. Oteacha chihiyata honhahaha.
Ugly Bob: He said the evil that took her wasn't Canadian at all, but a beast who preys upon people of all nationalities. They can lead us to the best, but we will have to destroy it.
Scott: This is stupid! I'm tellin' you you're making a mistake, kid!
Ugly Bob: Aw, leave the kid alone, Scott.
Scott: Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours!
Female: Junekolak osne kae dedahaes's ethlah?
Baby: Decheheng janon cheha i a.
Ugly Bob: Don't worry. If there's one thing eskimos are good at, it's finding things.
Scott: Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!
Ike: Stop being a dick, Scott!
Scott: Oh, so now I'm a dick!
Scott: It's the princess!
Cast: Your teeth are your friends. They're friends in your mouth. Take care of your friends or they'll rot and fall out.
Dental Floss: And dental floss also is here to help you.
Kyle: Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?
Mr. Mackey: FLAT! You're FLAT!
Scott: There!
Scott: Who took you, Princess?!
Scott: Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!
Princess: I should have always brushed and flossed and avoided sweets!
Princess: Save me! Save me!
Ugly Bob: It's coming for me! Help!
Princess: Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Mr. Mackey: What?! Why?! Don't worry, I will be better! These kids just aren't listenin' to me!
Sgt. Yates: No. it's over! They got him, Mr. Mackey. Tooth Decay. They got the sonofabitch.
Officer: Up in the Yukon. All bureause are confirming it.
Sgt. Yates: You can let it go, Mackey. Tooth Decay is gone.
Mr. Mackey: Oho... Oh God... Go on home, kids. M'kay? It's over!
Narrator: The princess now giving the Canadian Medal of Courage to Ugly Bob, and also to Scott, who is of course a giant dick, aaand Katuktuk of the Yukon. And the medal of course made of white chocolate, as is tradition. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. The duke of Calgary standing up and putting on a fake beard, a tradition passed down since the birth of Canada. The princess now knighting Sir Ike Broflovski, giving him three kisses and a pair of socks, as is tradition.
Stan: My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
Cartman: My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
Kyle: Hmmm, yeah.
Narrator: And now the scraping off of the pudding.
Butters: And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
Stan: No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Butters: Skeletor's a lady??
Butters: Hey Eric.
Kyle: You get in trouble again, Cartman?
Cartman: No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
Stan: Dude we're, we're just trying to eat.
Stan: Yeah.
Cartman: Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
Cartman: Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
Stan: Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
Cartman: Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
Kyle: That doesn't make any sense.
Cartman: Go look for yourselves!!
Cartman: There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
Butters: Is that really all our wiener sizes?
Craig: Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.
Butters: Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?
Principal Victoria: I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
Stan: Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
Cartman: No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
Butters: A conspiracy?
Cartman: They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
Kyle: Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
Cartman: Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
Butters: Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.
Cartman: Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
Butters: Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
Cartman: Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
Butters: Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
Cartman: Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
Butters: I'm hung like a horse!
Kyle: Didn't you forget something?
Cartman: What, Kyle?
Kyle: You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
Cartman: Yeah, it's pretty good.
Kyle: Your wiener is not 13 inches long!
Stan: You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
Cartman: Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
Stan: You just did that to everybody in class!
Millie: Actual boys' penis sizes?
Nelly: Gross!
Cartman: Oh, Goddamnit!
Cartman: Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!
Principal Victoria: You're darn right, Eric!
Cartman: For what?!
Principal Victoria: Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
Cartman: Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
Cartman: I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
Principal Victoria: Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?
Cartman: You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
Cartman: What?
Cartman: Those weren't our dick sizes?
Principal Victoria: Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?
Cartman: I don't know! Why would you?!
Principal Victoria: We didn't!
Principal Victoria: This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!
Cartman: Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
Principal Victoria: Because you have an anger problem, Eric!
Cartman: Fuck you! No I don't!
Doctor: What we need to figure out here is, are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism? Some rage addiction? It could be a lot of things.
Liane: My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
Doctor: Let's try a little experiment. I wanna see maybe what kind of things... trigger you, Eric. Okay? How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
Cartman: Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
Cartman: I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
Principal Victoria: Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
Randy: Oh dear.
Principal Victoria: Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.
Mrs. Stevens: How does the school let things like this happen??
Principal Victoria: Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
Randy: Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.
Doctor: I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
Bodybuilder: We didn't make any effort, we didn't have a choice!
Tea Bag Participant: Yeah! This is bullshit!
Doctor: Together, we're gonna learn what makes us angry, okay? And how to better deal with it so we don't get ourselves into trouble anymore.
Michael: So lame! Why doesn't everyone just die?!
Tuong Lu Kim: Rook! Ifuh somebody ordereduh shitty beef, anduh complain because they say they ordereduh shitty shrimp, It's notuh my fault he gets the shitty chicken poured all over hisuh fucking head!
Tea Bag Participant: We have good reason to be angry! This country is going to shit! We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone, and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
Doctor: Right. See, what we all need to do is chaaannel our various reasons for anger, and learn to control it.
Wigger: Man, this shit wack, manh. I just see all this shit fummah. I'm in the stands like pozze no fuckin' good manh. Bitch be callin me tappin that shit, man.
Cartman: Why the fuck am I here?!
Doctor: Well, Eric, because I know you want to... control your anger and become a better person.
Cartman: Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
Doctor: NO No, I'm not saying that, at all. Please I, I'm just saying how a-, amazing you are for wanting to... l-lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.
Cartman: Oh, that's cool.
Randy: And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.
Riley: Example 1: Randy has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
Riley: Its angle is 32 degrees. Its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter. His balls are seven centimeters from the base.
Randy: Seven centimeters...
Riley: Randy notes that the drift of his penis is four centimeters to penis right, and its dead weight is .5 kilograms.
Chase: Scrawny-ass sissies!
Doctor: Okay, Daniel's a scrawny-ass sissy, he just cut in front of you in line at the bank. Go!
Daniel: Huh I don't have a small penis! My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
Wayne D: Yo, bitch! You think you bad? Just 'cause you're a mom don't mean I can't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mang!
Gretchen: I may be female on the outside, but I still have a bigger penis than you!
Wayne D: I don't have a small penis! Don't say that, it isn't true! It isn't true!
Tuong Lu Kim: That's enough! I've beem sick of everyone talk aboutuh penis shize!
Daniel: Yeah, it doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!
Chase: No.
Gretchen: No.
Tuong Lu Kim: Not me.
Daniel: Nnnooo.
Wayne D: No, my, my shit be packing, manh.
Cartman: My penis is 13 inches long.
Doctor: Hmmm.
Guest Speaker: Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnod, and I'm an "actual doctor" of human sexuality and behavior. Unfortunately you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days, and I am here to set things straight.
Wendy: Thank God.
Doctor: We all want to welcome our new member, Randy. Say hi to everyone, Randy.
Randy: Aw, suck it! All o'ya!
Doctor: Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy. Why don't you share what's bothering you?
Randy: You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
Daniel: Goddamn right! Socialist fascist!
Doctor: Mr. Marsh, this is what we're here to try and work on, okay?
Randy: No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!
Randy: Yeeaahh!
Cartman: Yeah dude!
Wayne D: Man, that shit be burnin' an' shit, manh!
Gretchen: Yeeaahh!
Clerk: Welcome to FedEx. How can I help you today?
Customer: Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
Clerk: Alrighty, let's see what kind of-
Field Reporter: Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. They call themselves the pissed-off and angry party. And they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
Field Reporter: What exactly are you angry about?
Randy: We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-
Cartman: The Jews!
Randy: Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!
Field Reporter: You've got a lot of people scared. What are your demands?
Randy: Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
Chase: Yeeaahh!
Randy: And we want-
Randy: Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,
Wayne D: And my mom gotta stop trippin', manh. Bitch be trippin' all the time, manh.
Cartman: No, and fuck Kyle!
Randy: Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
Field Reporter: Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the Federal Government?
Linda: Butters, what are you doing?
Linda: Your T.M.I.?
Linda: Butters, put your clothes on.
Aide 1: Surgeon general, twelve more FedExes have been taken over; the Pissed Off and Angry Party is gaining more support!
Aide 2: They've shut down American Airlines and American Apparels all over the country. We have to ask you to step down.
Rebecca Turnod: Are you seriously saying we're going to give in to their demands?
Aide 2: They're all really angry. We have to make them stop. Is the team standing by to fuck that little boy Kyle?
Aide 3: Team is standing by, sir.
Rebecca Turnod: Who is this?
Rebecca Turnod: Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter. The T.M.I. equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed. There's nothing we can do about it.
Doctor: Isn't there? Isn't... there?
Daniel: We've waited long enough, Randy! Let's start killin' these sons of bitches!
Woman: No, please!
Cartman: Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
Wayne D: Yo let's cap these bitches, manh! Let's cap an leave em at the back of the building, manh!
Announcer: We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
Rebecca Turnod: Fellow Americans, as you all know, the T.M.I. scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk. The established equation is a hundred percent accurate.
Randy: Rrrr!
Daniel: Shhh.
Cartman: Wait, what?
Cartman: Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
Cartman: I'm still fucking angry!
Stan: I know! This is awesome!
Stan: What?
Sarah McLachlan: These are images of babies born addicted to crack cocaine. Their mothers have abandoned them. They lie in the dark, crying, with nobody to hold them.
Stan: Awww dude, awwww.
Kyle: Aaaggh, God.
Nurse: It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.
Kyle: What exactly can I do to help?
Kyle: Oh it's, it's so sad.
Cartman: Oh. Hey Kyle.
Cartman: I'm volunteering.
Nurse: Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.
Kyle: Why do you have a video camera?
Kyle: I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
Ms. Williams: Certainly. We're... here all the time, unfortunately.
Kyle: What's going on?!
Cartman: Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
Kyle: Alright, what is it?!
Kyle: Why do you need me?
Kyle: I knew you were doing something terrible!
Cartman: What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
Kyle: Lots of people will when I tell them!
Kyle: You what?
Kyle: A thousand dollars.
Cartman: Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
Kyle: There's a big wait to sit down.
Waiter: Ah, Mr. Cartman. We have your table waiting, sir.
Cartman: We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
Kyle: Jesus Christ.
Craig: It's awesome.
Cartman: It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
Butters: Every single night.
Cartman: Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
Kyle: Wow...
Cartman: We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
Cartman: Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
Kyle: Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.
Kyle: I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.
Stan: Doing what?
Kyle: Crack baby... basketball.
Cartman: Betsy MacIntosh?
Betsy MacIntosh: Whatta you want?
Cartman: We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
Betsy MacIntosh: Oh Gohhhd.
Betsy MacIntosh: It's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until I use again.
Cartman: And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
Cartman: We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?
Betsy MacIntosh: They said it's a boy.
Betsy MacIntosh: How much will he make?
Cartman: Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.
Betsy MacIntosh: So what? You would make money off of my child? That doesn't seem fair.
Cartman: I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-
Betsy MacIntosh: Cain't you change the rules?
Stan: ...You sound like Cartmam.
Stan: Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.
Cartman: It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
Clyde: We're just having a hard time finding him.
Cartman: They can't make money. It's against the rules.
Kyle: But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
Cartman: Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
Kyle: Gut they're the ones risking injury.
Cartman: What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
Kyle: The government could come after us, Cartman.
Cartman: We're a non-profit company, Kyle.
Kyle: So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
Kyle: A hot tub?!
Kyle: Gravy?
Cartman: Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
Kyle: No way.
Kyle: I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
Cartman: It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
Kyle: What other companies?
Dean Howland: In the what?
Dean Howland: I have... no idea what you're talkin' about.
Dean Howland: Are you referring to our student athletes?
Cartman: Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- "student atheletes" then?
Cartman: I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?
Dean Howland: Get out! This is a prestigious university and I am not saying one more word to you!
Cartman: How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!
Clyde: We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.
Cartman: How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
Clyde: We don't know. He's everywhere.
Cartman: Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
Craig: Oh, that's a good idea.
Cartman: ...What?
Kyle: I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!
Cartman: Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!
Kyle: ...What?
Postmaster: Let me get this straight. You kids want me to tell you where Slash lives?
Craig: Please sir, it's very important.
Postmaster: Well I'm afraid I can't do that, kids.
Clyde: But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.
Roger: Hullo?
Clyde: Dad, is Slash real or make-believe?
Roger: Ohh dear. Clyde's asking about Slash.
Roger: Clyde, the truth is Slash isn't a person. He's more like a... feeling in your heart, you know?
Clyde: Slash isn't real.
Craig: Get out of here.
Clyde: He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.
Roger: Your mother's Dutch, you know, Clyde. Ha- how did that old folk song go, honey?
Betsy: Vunter Slash kapunshka
Both Parents: Shpielerin manshunshka
Cartman: What?
Craig: Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.
Butters: Slash is make-believe??
Cartman: Vunter Slash?
Kyle: What?
Cartman: But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?
Clyde: One of our parents.
Cartman: But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?
Clyde: One of our parents!
Cartman: You knew about this??
Butters: Well what the heck do we do now?
Kyle: Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!
Kyle: Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
Kyle: You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
Cartman: I just can't believe Slash isn't real,
Butters: I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
Kyle: You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
Cartman: I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.
Stan: It's what?
Ms. Williams: Isn't it wonderful? All the crack babies will have a home now.
Kyle: You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
Stan: Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
Child singers: Vunter Slash kapunshka. Shpielerin manshunshka. Het mine gaset rosa. Danka Vunter Slasha
Cashier: What's this?
Butters: An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
Cashier: Thanks.
Tuong Lu Kim: Welcome to Shitty Wok. Can I take a order prease?
Butters: Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.
Butters: It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
Butters: Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.
Tuong Lu Kim: Where is this Japanese-uh toiret bowl?! How far from my Shitty Wok?!
Butters: Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.
Mr. Takiyama: Welcome to City Sushi. Can I take er order prease?
Tuong Lu Kim: What's the big idea putting your Shitty Sushi right next to my Shitty Wok?!
Mr. Takiyama: I'm sorry I do not understand your accent. You want a Shitty tuna roll?
Tuong Lu Kim: No I don't want Shitty tuna roll! I want you to go find another shitty town to open your Shitty Sushi prace!
Mr. Takiyama: Why don't you please ujust speak Engrish? Maybe I can understand you!
Mr. Takiyama: Get out or I call porice!
Tuong Lu Kim: Come on, kid, you don't wanna eat this-a Shitty Sushi! It give you worms.
Steven: Hello?
Sgt. Yates: Sir, does this mailman belong to you?
Stephen: That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?
Sgt. Yates: There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it.
Stephen: What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!
Butters: But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
Linda: What's going on?
Stephen: Butters started an Asian turf war!
Linda: Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?
Stephen: I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda.
Stephen: Well Dr. Janus?
Dr. Janus: I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder.
Linda: What?
Dr. Janus: There are several distinct personalities going on in there. One is named "Postman Butters" and yet another is "Fireman Butters." And then there's even "Inspector Butters" and uh, "Professor Chaos".
Linda: Oh my God!
Dr. Janus: From what I gather, he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when he's outside playing. Sometimes he's a cowboy and other times he's an Indian, and the two seem to be at constant odds.
Linda: Oh, poor Butters!
Stephen: Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?
Field Reporter: Tom, a brand new sushi place has opened in South Park, adding to our booming Asian district. With the addition of the new Chinese restaurant, townspeople are officially naming this whole Chinatown area "Little Tokyo."
Mr. Takiyama: I told you not to come in here!
Tuong Lu Kim: Now everyone in town think a Chinese and a Japanese are the same fucking thing!
Mr. Takiyama: I don't even know what the fuck you are saying! Uhpupuh putuh peepee!
Stephen: Oh God the medication isn't working!
Butters: Oh hey Dad.
Butters: I love you too, Dad.
Mr. Takiyama: Youuu, get out! I told you not to come in here!
Tuong Lu Kim: Okay, whoa, just hold a minute, hold a minute. I come ina peace.
Mr. Takiyama: I don't berieve you!
Tuong Lu Kim: Come on, rook! All this fighting, it's just to sirry, you know? Chinese anda Japanese been fighting for so rong. It'sa ridicurous. What we need... is to have a tweaty.
Mr. Takiyama: What is tweaty?
Tuong Lu Kim: Nono, we need a tweaty.
Mr. Takiyama: A tweaty?
Tuong Lu Kim: No, not a treaty, a tweaty!
Mr. Takiyama: Oh, you mean a treaty?
Tuong Lu Kim: What the fuck is a tweaty?
Mr. Takiyama: No no, a treaty.
Matt (Nelly's Dad): Teriyaki isn't from China?
Mr. Takiyama: Very well. I will do assembly with you.
Dr. Janus: Butters, when you were playing in the yard yesterday, do you remember becoming someone named... Big Rig Butters?
Butters: Sure.
Dr. Janus: What makes Big Rig Butters come out? Did somebody hurt him? Did he do something bad he can't forgive himself for?
Butters: Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
Dr. Janus: You don't know. But, maybe somebody else in there does. Do you think it would be possible for me to speak with... Inspector Butters?
Butters: Sure.
Dr. Janus: I'm now speaking to the person known as Inspector Butters.
Butters: Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
Dr. Janus: Inspector Butters, what do you want?
Butters: Uh, well, to solve mysteries.
Dr. Janus: And is there someone else living with you, someone named... Professor Chaos?
Butters: Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
Dr. Janus: He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?
Butters: What? Why would I do that?
Dr. Janus: Who am I speaking to now?
Butters: Me, Butters.
Dr. Janus: Ah, Butters. You're back.
Butters: Sir, I'm confused.
Dr. Janus: I know you are. This is going to sound scary, pal, but... you have people living inside your head. And some of them want to murder you.
Butters: Really?
Dr. Janus: Yes, I'm afraid you're a little sick. But it's okay, because together we're going to get you well.
Butters: Pardon me?
Alias 1: He's just a big old stick in the mud who doesn't like to play.
Dr. Janus: Don't mind him, Butters. Billy's a pretty messed up kid. He was molested by his uncles.
Psycho Janus: Dr. Janus isn't going to be alive for long! I'm going to kill him!
Dr. Janus: Now, what are the things that make you happy, Butters? What's the matter, Butters? Are you still with us? Is one of your other personalities trying to take over?
Billy: Let's play Battleship! All hands on the poop deck!
Psycho Janus: Your soul will bleed for eternity!
Alias 2: You don't even know what sexy is, Mr. Harrison.
Dr. Janus: What are you feeling, Butters? Are you nervous about your condition?
Butters: Yes!
Butters: Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!
Tuong Lu Kim: This whoooore thing is China, and Japan is this riiittle bitty country over here. And that's why the Japanese always try anda take over China!
Mr. Takiyama: What?!
Tuong Lu Kim: The Japanese planned to kill people in Nanking! The only thing Japanese ruve more than killing people is killing themselves! Suicide rate in Japan sky-high!
Mr. Takiyama: Fuck you!
Tuong Lu Kim: "Oh no, I'm a Japanese and I had a bad day! I think I'm gonna kill myself!"
Dr. Janus: Oh, hello Butters. I wasn't expecting you till 5:30.
Dr. Janus: Yes. did you catch something?
Butters: Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
Butters: Huh?
Dr. Janus: What, Inspector butters figured out I set him up?!
Butters: Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
Dr. Janus: Oh come on! You think multiple personality disorder is real?! I've been using that to scam this town for seven years! Now I gotta get out of here, thanks to you! But I'm getting one last heist before I go, and you're gonna help me!
Dr. Janus: Get in there! Move it, asshole!
Dr. Janus: Butters? Butters, what are you doing? What is that? A blowtorch? Put that down! You're having another episode!
Butters: What?
Dr. Janus: Butters. Your name is Butters! Try and remember!
Butters: But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
Dr. Janus: We have to try and understand that he can't help what he's doing, officer. He probably has no memory of it at all.
Sgt. Yates: Well, at least everything is accounted for. Thank God you came when you did, Dr. Janus.
Steven: Breaking into a store, Butters?! What are you?!
Sgt. Yates: Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son.
Steven: Oh, we'll ground the shit out of him, detective. Thank you so much.
Tuong Lu Kim: Herro-o.
Mr. Takiyama: You get the fuck out of my place!
Tuong Lu Kim: Okay, hold on, hold on, please! I'ma sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I admit it. I fucked you at the assembly. How about you and me together do an Asian Diversity festival?
Mr. Takiyama: Get the fuck out before I call police!
Tuong Lu Kim: Please, I admitting it, okay?I fucked you at assembly. There's no way around it. It was verrry sneaky. Kind of like Pearl Harbor. Okay? That was a little sneaky too, huh? Pearl Harbor kind of sneaky; I think we can all be a rittle sneaky sometimes, hm? But that sneaky Chinese man? He's gone! Okay? Okay, if we can have Asian Diversity festival, then we no longer have to deal witha "recial stereotypes." Prease.
Mr. Takiyama: Against my better judgment, I will trust you one more time. But this time, you'd better not rub your hands together when you turn around to walk away.
Butters: Wahh!
Dr. Janus: If you draw any attention he'll kill us!
Butters: Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
Dr. Janus: No, you can't. But you know somebody who can. Inspector Butters.
Butters: What??
Dr. Janus: You've got to become Inspector Butters again and help me find out what the mean man wants.
Butters: No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
Butters: It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
Dr. Janus: This is kinda fun. You're Inspector Butters and I'm your faithful assistant, Dr. Watson!
Butters: Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
Butters: Hah?
Dr. Janus: Oh dear. It's okay, Butters. You just think you're Inspector Butters right now.
Butters: Aw man.
Butters: Oh, come on!
Dr. Janus: You aren't leaving here, Inspector! None of you are!
Mr. Takiyama: What took you so long?!
Mr. Takiyama: Urgh. Fuck you! I'ma not trying to kill myself!
Tuong Lu Kim: Porice?! How?!
Sgt. Yates: We know the truth, Dr. Janus!
Mr. Takiyama: Thisa Chinise rat trying to kill me!
Sgt. Yates: He's not Chinese! He's white!
Tuong Lu Kim: What the fuck you talkin' about?!
Steven: So you're telling us that Dr. Janus has been the owner of City Wok all this time?
Butters: Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
Steven: Yes Butters. Thanks to you, maybe Dr. Janus can get back to his real self.
Steven: Whattaya mean?
Sgt. Yates: Well I mean, would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking he's Lu Kim forever? Now that City Sushi is gone, City Wok is the only Chinese restaurant left in town.
Desk Officer: Oh yeah.
Black Officer: Yeah. Let's just let him keep believing he's a Chinese man.
Sgt. Yates: Done!
Other Officers: Good! Alright! Alright! Yeah!
Blond Officer: Detective, he's asking for a blanket. Is that alright?
Cartman: Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
Cartman: Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
Cartman: Yaaaay!
Kyle: Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.
Kyle: Oh God...
Butters: I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
Kyle: Here, this one's from me, Stan.
Stan: Oh thanks, dude.
Cartman: Stan's getting another present, Mom.
Stan: Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
Kyle: Yeah dude!
Kyle: Yeah they're the best!
Sharon: Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff.
Stan: Mom, I'm 10 years old now.
Sharon: I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.
Cartman: Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
Randy: Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
Sharon: Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.
Randy: Well, do you really think we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?
Sharon: Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!
Randy: Tween Wave?
Sharon: You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!
Randy: Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?
Sharon: This is different!
Sharon: Well, it sounds like crap, right?!
Sharon: Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!
Randy: No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.
Sharon: Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!
Anchorman: It's called Tween Wave, and if you're a parent your kids are probably listening to it. A new music genre for the era from 2009 through 2012. or "The Tweens." Every generation has their music, but many parents say Tween Wave sounds like crap.
Man 1: It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good.
Woman 1: This sounds like poo.
Anchorman: Kids however say they don't hear crap at all.
Kid 1: Parents are dumb.
Kid 2: They don't get it.
Kid 1: They don't get it. Parents are stupid.
Kid 3: Tween Wave is swick.
Kid 4: Tweem Wave is super swick and parents don't get it, 'cause their ears are old.
Kid 5: Parents are dumb.
Sharon: We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.
Kyle: But that's our music! We like it!
Randy: Yeah it's good!
Sheila: What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?
Stan: We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
Randy: Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.
The Boys: Yuck!
Randy: What?
Stan: That sounds like shit!
Gerald: Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
Kyle: Gross!
Cartman: Turn it off dude!
Sharon: Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you.
Stan: I know, Mom. I love you too.
Sharon: Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff.
Stan: It's okay, Mom. I understand.
Stan: Hey dudes.
Kyle: Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.
Stan: Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
Stan: Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
Kyle: Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.
Stan: No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
Kyle: Why? What's it sound like?
Stan: It... kind of sounds like shit.
Kyle: What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?
Kyle: No.
Stan: That doesn't sound like shit to you?
Kyle: NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.
Stan: And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.
Doctor: Uh huh, and what about food? Are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now, too?
Stan: Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
Stan: I just turned 10.
Doctor: Well, that makes sense. You see Stan, as you get older, your eardrums, taste buds, all that stuff develops and changes.
Stan: So this is normal?
Stan: Sounds like shit.
Stan: Uh that sounds like shit too.
Doctor: Wait, this sounds like shit to you?
Stan: Yeah dude, it's just shit.
Doctor: You don't see any difference in the pictures?
Stan: No.
Stan: They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
Doctor: Oh dear. I think I know what this is. You see Stan, as you get older, things that you used to like start looking and sounding like shit. And things that seemed shitty as a child don't seem as shitty. With you, somehow, the wires have gotten crossed and everything looks and sounds like shit to you. It's a condition called "being a cynical asshole."
Stan: Oh no.
Randy: Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
Sharon: Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!
Sharon: Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called "getting older", Randy. It's okay.
Randy: That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!
Sharon: It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!
Randy: Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
Bar Patron: You suck!
Janitor/Farmer 1: Did you know we're livin' in the Tween time?
Farmer 2: Nah, I'd a heard that.
Janitor/Farmer 1: Guess it's the period between 2009 and 2013. They call it the Tweens. So they got this feller down at the bowling alley? He gets up on the stage an' shits his britches.
Farmer Friend 2: What fer?
Farmer 2: You mean that guy that plays the blues and died in an airplane crash?
Janitor/Farmer 1: Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.
Cartman: Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
Kenny: (Get him!)
Kyle: Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
Cartman: He's lying, dude. Hit X
Stan: Hey guys.
Kyle: Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?
Stan: He said I have cynicism?
Cartman: What's that?
Stan: Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
Kyle: Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.
Stan: Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
Cartman: Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
Kyle: Yeah, we got him!
Stan: How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
Kenny: (Hit the X button, Kyle!)
Kyle: We're gonna level up to detective!
Stan: That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
Kyle: Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?
Kyle: You don't wanna eat it?
Stan: It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
Cartman: Look like ice cream to me.
Kyle: Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
Stan: Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
Stan: What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
Farmer Friend 2: Lord, I ain't never seen britches take a whoopin' like that.
Janitor/Farmer 1: I told you. Them britches don't stand a chance.
Farmer Friend 2: Wait now, who's that lady?
Janitor/Farmer 1: That there's Steamy Nicks.
Farmer Friend 2: You mean that gal who played for Fleetwood Mac and wrote that song "Landslide"?
Janitor/Farmer 1: I agree. Why don't you leave them poor britches alone?
Farmer Friend 2: Them britches have had enough!
Waitress: All alone today?
Stan: Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
Waitress: Well, what can I get you?
Stan: Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
Waitress: A little young to be so pessimistic, aren't ya kid?
Stan: Dude, you totally lied to me!
Kyle: No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
Stan: Where were you guys going?!
Kyle: Alright dude, we were going to the movies.
Stan: Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
Kyle: Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is "that looks like shit" and, and "this is shitty!"
Stan: You guys... don't wanna be around me?
Kyle: Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
Stan: Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
Stan: I won't say a word.
Stan: Oh shit.
Cartman: Oh cool, the movie trailers!
Kyle: Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
Stan: Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Cartman: That looks pretty good.
Stan: How can you say that looks good?!
Kyle: Shhh, you're doing it again!
Cartman: Stan, knock it off!
Stan: But it's just crap.
Kyle: No, they're penguins! Stop it!
Stan: Oh come on, people!
Stan: Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry.
Cartman: No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
Stan: Me?! Did you see that shit?!
Stan: Hang on guys!
Stan: Kyle?
Stan: I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
Randy: You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!
Sharon: Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!
Randy: I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!
Sharon: ... You're 42 years old, Randy!
Randy: I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!
Sharon: Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!
Farmer Friend 2: What do you suppose is goin' on in there?
Janitor/Farmer 1: Sound like Steamy Ray Vaughn is goin' at it with his wife over Steamy Nicks.
Farmer Friend 2: You... sure you wanna do this?
Janitor/Farmer 1: We got to now, if their fightin' is our best chance tuh save them britches.
Randy: Why can't you ever just support me?!
Sharon: Support what?! Another stupid dream of yours?!
Randy: Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!
Sharon: I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous.
Randy: I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
Sharon: I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me.
Randy: You kind of seem shitty to me too.
Sharon: People get older, Randy. People grow apart.
Kyle: Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
Kenny: (Are you serious?!)
Cartman: Yep!
Kyle: That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!
Cartman: Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
Cartman: Wait what?
Kyle: That's what they're talking about on the news!
Cartman: Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
Kyle: Yes!
Cartman: You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
Butters: Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
Mr. Garrison: No. Butters, that's not how it works.
Mr. Garrison: Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later. Right now we're talking about vaginal warts.
Wendy: This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?
Butters: You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
Cartman: That's right, it's a butt fungus.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, Stan, you, you've gotta try and pull yourself out of this, m'kay? I know that... your parents recently got divorced. M'kay, that's gotta be hard. I know that's... that's bad. But when you walk around all mopey, m'kay, and sayin' everything is... just shitty, well, that's called bein' a Debbie Downer, Stan. And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay. ...I mean you've gotta, you've gotta snap out of it, Debbie. Come on, Debbie, you're even bummin' me out now, m'kay? Your attitude just- just sucks.
Mr. Mackey: Okay, well, that's not gonna happen, Debbie. Okay, you know, uh life, life has to change, m'kay?
Anchor: In response to the embarrassment, the President of the United States has passed "Stan's Bill," putting an end to school-mandated vaccinations.
Anchor: It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations, but if so, multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.
Cartman: Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
Nurse Bronski: Eric, what is it this time?
Cartman: Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
Nurse Bronski: Can you lay on your stomach?
Cartman: A what??
Cartman: What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
Nurse Bronski: Very funny!
Nurse Bronski: Get out of my office!
Kyle: I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
Wendy: I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.
Boy 1: Those two should just screw and get it over with!
Boy 2: Yeaahh...
Kyle: I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
Wendy: Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-
Kyle: What's the matter dude?
Cartman: Really?
Kyle: Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!
Cartman: Gee, thanks Kyle!
Researcher: Alright, are we clear?
Stan: Wait, it's not a real illness?
Neo: So do we. All of us here. We know the truth too.
Morpheus: We found a way to make it stop, Stan. Now are you interested? Or not?
Cartman: Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
Cartman: There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
Molly: Thanks!
Cartman: How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
Kyle: About three minutes, fatass!
Cartman: Nice!
Butters: Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
Cartman: It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
Morpheus: Alright, is he ready to be sent in?
Bald Guy: He's ready! Beta levels are normal.
Stan: Who are you people?
Stan: Huh?
Morpheus: The world around us has all completely turned to shit. But aliens are putting out a brainwave that keeps most people seeing a false reality
Stan: Aliens?
Morpheus: Or, robots from the future, whatever. The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance.
Neo 2: Yeah. Everything used to be awesome and cool, but now everything's gone to shit and nobody knows except us!
Neo: Yeah!
Morpheus: Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you! All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down. They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you! Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?
Stan: Yeah I'm ready!
Adam Sandler: Jill, you got a date with Al Pacino?
Jill: I think Al Pacino wants to play Twister with your sister.
Kyl: Hey, Stan!
Kyle: Stan, are you alright?
Stan: Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
Kyle: Dude. Have you been drinking?
Stan: You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
Kyle: See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
Cartman: Everything alright here, Kyle?
Kyle: Yeah, it's fine.
Cartman: We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
Kyle: Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.
Stan: Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
Kyle: Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
Neo: How does it feel to be back in the Matrix?
Stan: I feel like total shit.
Bald Guy: It's okay. That's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.
Morpheus: Try and focus, Stan: we've found them! We know where the rock creatures are now.
Stan: The rock creatures?
Morpheus: Or aliens, or AI- things. Whatever, fuck you.
Stan: Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
Morpheus: Come on kid, there's not a lot of time left.
Neo: You're pushin' him too hard!
Stan: Ugh God.
Other Execs: Yes, yes, but what do we do?
KFC Exec: At KFC we've seen a 50% drop in sales.
Pizza Hut Exec: It's worse at Pizza Hut. Cartman Burgers choked out the market.
Pizza Hut Exec: It would have to be some sort of super Dutch oven.
McDonald's Exec: You know the secret?
Stan: What? You guys are aliens?
McDonald's Exec: Stop playing with us! What's the secret behind Cartman Burger's amazing taste?!
Stan: Dude, I don't know!
McDonald's Exec: Ah ha!
Stan: I'm not friends with him.
Taco Bell Exec: They've been through everything together. Inseparable.
Stan: No, no, we don't hang out anymore.
McDonald's Exec: Oho right, like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that?
Stan: Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
McDonald's Exec: Oh sure! Anyone would ditch out on their best friend 'cause they weren't feeling good! Now stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers is so delicious!
Stan: I don't know!
McDonald's Exec: Alright, I guess we're going to have to do this the hard way.
Kyle: There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.
Cartman: Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
Stan: Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
Kyle: What are you doing?
Stan: How do you guys make them so yummy?
Kyle: I don't know.
Kyle: Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
Stan: No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
Stan: Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
Kyle: You said "fuck you" to my face, Stan.
Stan: Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
McDonald's Exec: Oh yeah, like any friend would say something that severe and then try to take it back.
Kyle: Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
Morpheus: Alright, nice work Stan. Now comes the final step! You have to take out Duck President!
Stan: Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
Morpheus: But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was!
Randy: We worked it out, pal. Surprise!
Stan: No, dad, no. No, please!
Stan: No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
Sharon: People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.
Kyle: You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
Crowd: Eeewww!
Big Harry: I like that!
Mike: Yeah.
Butters: Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!
Stan: Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
Kyle: Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.
Kyle: Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
Kyle: Better than being a fat-ass Texan!
Cartman: Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
Kyle: No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!
Clyde: I was enthralled with the dialog exchange.
Token: Base!
Craig: I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.
Jimmy: Eh, b-base.
Token: Why?
Stan: Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
Cartman: I'm not pouting! I've just heard all these jokes before!
Kyle: So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
Woman: Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse.
Man: Oh my God, are you alright?
Butters: Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. M-mis amigos, my a-, my amigos are waiting.
Man: Poor thing must have snuck across the border and then lost track of his family.
Butters: I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.
Man: Darling, I don't know if we can keep him.
Man: Yep, window.
Man: Auhp, be sure to get the edges.
Woman: Oh darling, it's wonderful.
Stan: What are you talking about?
Cartman: Where is Butters?
Stan: Yeah, I think he was? Wait.
Craig: Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.
Kyle: Butters?
Stan: Butters!
Craig: Game on!
Woman: It's a present, Mantequilla. Un presente.
Woman: Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy.
Man: Hup. Nono, Mantequilla! You're just blowing the leaves from one side to the other. Get them in one pile so you can use the garbage bags we loaned you.
Butters: Ah, s seor.
Woman: Oh he's so adorable.
Woman: It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the windows, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said "I need to go home." I tried telling him "your home is here, Mantequilla! Tu casa es aqu!" But I don't think he feels it.
Man: Well, maybe if we let him paint the garage, he'll feel more like family and then-
Woman: No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!
Butters: Hey, where are you going?
Butters: Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
Worker 1: Mantequilla?
Worker 2: Mantequilla?
Butters: Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
Butters: Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
Butters: All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.
Worker 3: S, vamonos a la chingada!
Butters: Viva la Meheeco!
Doctor: Alright, let's get him into ER.
Butters: We're crossin' the border!
Butters: Ol!
Border Officer 1: Pretty quiet out there.
Border Officer 1: Just seems like Mexicans don't try to cross into the US as much as they used to, you know?
Anchorman: But just what has sparked the Mexican desire to live... in Mexico? Joining us now is economist Mark Geiger, and Mark, we've heard of Mexican ice cream, but Mexican patriotism?
Cartman: You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
Kyle: "Wanted by the U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!
Cartman: You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
Kyle: Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
Chris: Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.
Cartman: Oh dude. Sweet.
Butters: Wow.
Cartman: This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
Marcus: The baton is non-lethal, but powerful e-
Border Officer 2: You're pretty good at stoppin' Mexicans, son. What's your name?
Cartman: Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
Narrator: Dedicated. Patriotic. Tireless. These are the men and women of the US Border Patrol. They work around the clock protecting America's prosperity. They are the front line in making sure Mexicans stay here and work. The border patrol is uncompromising, diligent, and kewl. They will defend, arrest, and most importantly, let the Mexicans know that they are way better off here in the United States.
Border Officer 2: When we asked Obama to stop illegal immigrants, we didn't mean to make the US so shitty they wouldn't wanna come anymore.
Border Officer 5: Come on, buddy!
Cartman: Wait a minute, isn't that...
Mexicans: Ohhh!
Cartman: Ey!
Cartman: I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
Butters: Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
Stan: Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.
Stan: What?
Kyle: The blond kid?
Cartman: Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!
Stan: What about him?
Cartman: Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
Butters: Eavesdropper?
Kyle: What's that?
Mrs. Melman: Oh no, what is it? Is he okay?
Craig: Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper?
Kyle: Dude, that's so wrong!
Cartman: Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, "Poopypants Pete", but th- but then I also thought of "Mushpants Melman."
Principal Victoria: Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom.
Principal Victoria: Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying.
Cartman: Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
Cartman: Hey! Whoooa.
Mr. Mackey: Spearheaded by you, m'kay, made him feel there was no other way out.
Cartman: 'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
Mr. Adler: Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete.
Principal Victoria: Please just let it go.
Cartman: You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
Mr. Mackey: We are hoping that if you don't fan the flames, Eric, the other students might forget might forget about it!
Cartman: Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
Stan: No way.
Kyle: What's up?
Stan: The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
Kyle: Dude, that's fucked up.
Stan: Come on dude, it's pretty funny.
Kyle: It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
Stan: Yeah dude, that's pretty funny.
Cartman: Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?
Jenny: What do you want?!
Cartman: Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
Jenny: I don't like you!
Jenny: Oh! Gahhh. Ohf.
Mr. Garrison: They're not fish like some of you retards chose.
Mr. Garrison: What's the matter?
Jenny: Gah I just need to go to the restroom!
Mr. Garrison: Well okay.
Jenny: Please! I've gotta go now!
Cartman: Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
Kids: Ew!
Butters: Sick!
Cartman: WAY worse!
Principal Victoria: ...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.
Cartman: Alright, kewl.
Cartman: Nobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
The three adults: Yes!
Mr. Mackey: Our students did average, maybe just below average.
Principal Victoria: That's insane!
Mr. Mackey: Uh, hi Jan, it's Counselor Mackey. Uh... how long would it take to organize a Pizza Friday for the students? Yeah, yeah no they uh, they actually did really well on the state exam. Yeah, mkay.
Stan: Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."
Kyle: That's not funny.
Stan: Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!
Kyle: It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
Stan: I wouldn't care.
Craig: Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.
Stan: What?
Craig: "In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'."
Kenny: (What?)
Stan: How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
Kenny: (I don't know.)
Stan: Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
Kenny: (No!)
Wendy: You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!
Stan: Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
Kyle: So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
Stan: Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
Stan: What? How do you know?
Kyle: Where is it coming from?
Craig: Huh?
Stan: We only have music class on Thursday.
Wendy: Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.
Kyle: Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
Stan: Oh I'm ready!
Stan: Don't let him get away!
Token: He's gone!
Stan: What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
Frog King: Once again Wikileaks is trying to wreak havoc on our world. Only you can stop him, Lemmiweaks.
Emily: It's just so embarrassing. What if the other girls find out my mother is in rehab?
Emily: Really? You too?
Tammy Nelson: That's just between us, okay?
Butters: NO Wikileaks! Bad!
Cartman: Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
Mr. Mackey: Eh, Is this one good?
Cartman: Yeah, I think they're all ready.
Principal Victoria: You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?
Cartman: It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
Mr. Mackey: Alright Eric, well, well get back to class. We don't want anyone seeing you in here with us.
Selena Gomez: Hi Eric. I understand you really wanted to meet me. Wanna get a picture together?
Cartman: No thanks. Okay, proceed.
Principal Victoria: Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?
Cartman: That. Was. Amazing.
Frog King: Then the moment is truly here! Come Lemmiwinks! Let us make haste! Le-le-Lemmiwinks? His heart is so heavy. I weep for him.
Sparrow Prince: Indeed. Could you do it, Frog Prince? Could you kill your own brother?
Stan: You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
Butters: Biggest story about who?
Catatafish: Well met, children of Adam. I, am Catatafish.
Kyle: What?
Catatafish: I come asking for your help. There is only one thing that can stop Wikileaks. But right now Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner.
Stan: Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?
Kyle: What is that thing?
Catatafish: I am Catatafish. I am a great wizard and, I am a friend. And I'm a ghost, besides of course being a fish.
Stan: Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
Catatafish: He does it purely for reasons of evil. And his treachery is not limited to humans. Wikileaks posted exaggerated things about me, too. He posted on his Web site that I had sex with an underage fish, and that I made her perform bass to mouth. If you accept this quest you will help the Gerbil King defeat Wikileaks once and for all! But the choice is yours. I'm not here to make you do anything. Like that underage salmon. I didn't make her do anything. If she wants to do bass to mouth, how is it my fault?
Randy: I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?
Nelson: I didn't see the game.
Nelson: Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
Nelson: Sure did.
Randy: What?
Worker 1: I took my girl to see that show last week. Got the best hummer of my entire life afterwards.
Nelson: Forty-five minutes non-stop.
Worker 2: It's true. I'm taking my wife on Saturday bro.
Nelson: I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome.
Randy: Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
Nelson: Wicked.
Randy: Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?
Sharon: Nono, I'm good, thanks.
Man 1: Enjoying the show?
Man 1: No?
Randy: To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.
Man 1: Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is "blowjob."
Randy: Subliminal messages?
Man 1: It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it "subtext." Just listen really, really closely.
The Wizard: While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!
Shelly: Do something, you stupid vegan!
Cartman: Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
Randy: You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!
Man 2: How long was it?
Randy: She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.
Worker 2: Nice, bro!
Randy: Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it.
Stephen: What was the show about?
Randy: Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.
Randy: Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
Worker 2: Wicked isn't even the best, bro. You've gotta check out Jersey Boys! It makes women hummer crazy!
Randy: Really??
Worker 1: Nonono, have you see South Pacific? That's a jaw-breaker.
Randy: Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
Sharon: Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?
Stan: Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
Randy: Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
Shelly: Not the vegans!
Stan: No. Dad. Please don't do this!
Shelly: Yes.
Mr. Feegan: Cancer, heart disease, drowning, all preventable with a vegan diet and a life jacket. And if people wanna say us vegans are silly, well they can just laugh all they want, 'cause being vegan is more important than being popular!
Mr. Feegan: You know that when you think you have the flu, you're actually experiencing the gastrointestinal effects of contaminated meats or eggs? Researchers have found that in meat-eating households there is more fecal bacteria in the kitchen sinks than in the toilets.
Randy: Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!
Man 2: Sounds like a dream, bro.
Randy: It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is "Wicked" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.
Worker 1: And Wicked moves to Seattle in a couple of weeks.
Nelson: It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.
Stephen: Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.
Randy: Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
Bob: Huh?
Lady 2: Oh I don't know, kind sir. Blowjobs seem a little degrading to me.
Man 4: Come now, a blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart.
Women: ... Blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs
Representative: Mr. Randy Marsh?
Representative: It is. I represent some of the biggest names in all of Broadway. They wish to speak with you.
Webber: Helleow.
Representative: Stephen Schwartz
Sondheim: Sup bro?
Randy: Not much, sup with you guys?
Sondheim: No. I mean, "sup, bro!"
Schwartz: We got wind of your musical. Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Randy: Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
Elton John: You're making it too obvious! Women are gonna figure out what we're doin'!
Sondheim: Musicals are about subtext!
Sondheim: "A blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart. Now get on your knees and put that heart to work."
Randy: And then she does. It's a metaphor.
Schwartz: Bro! What's metaphorical about a musical called "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"?!
Webber: Tricking bitches into hour-long blowjobs is an art form. You have to leave it to the professionals!
Sondheim: You're gonna ruin everything, you idiot!
Worker 2: Stephen Sondheim is really pissed off, Randy. He says he wants to challenge you to a bro down.
Worker 2: Randy, no! Stephen Sondheim is the greatest Broadway composer alive today! Perhaps the greatest of all time! You do NOT want to bro down with him.
Man 2: Don't bro down against Sondheim, Randy! It's suicide!
Larry: Oh no, you built another settlement?
Shelly: And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.
Mrs. Feegan: They're having such a great time together. I really wanna thank you, Sharon.
Sharon: No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too.
Mrs. Feegan: I have to admit it makes me a little nervous having Larry up there without a life preserver on, but I guess we have to take changes sometimes.
Sharon: That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical.
Mrs. Feegan: That's right, I, I hear his musical is getting a lot of attention, that it really has a chance of making it.
Sharon: Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.
Randy: Whassup brah?!
Sondheim: What brah?!
Randy: Sup brah?!
Sondheim: Take a swing, brah!
Webber: Let's go, Sondheim! Wipe the street with his punk ass!
Randy: What makes you the brauthority brah?!
Sondheim: West Side Story, brah!
Randy: What brah?!
Sondheim: Sweeney Todd, brah!
Randy: What brah?! What brah?!
Sondheim: Merrily We Rode Along, bro! Why you gotta disrespect, bro?!
Randy: I do respect you, bro!
Sondheim: Show some respect, bro!
Randy: I do respect you, bro!
Sondheim: Then stop disrespectin', bro!
Randy: I respect you, bro!
Sondheim: Okay, I respect you too!
Schwartz: The bro down is over! Let's bro out!
Spectator: Bro out!
Spectator 2: Party people!
Randy: Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!
Schwartz: That's what bros fuckin' do!
Sondheim: You're alright, Marsh. If it's cool with you, bro, Elton and Andrew and all of us wanna help you with your musical.
Randy: Hey, really??
Webber: How about instead of "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" we call it... "The Woman In White"
Randy: Oh, that is beautiful!
Sondheim: And a cheer to Randy Marsh. Welcome... to Bro'dway.
Randy: Bro'dwaaay!
Sondheim: Wooooooooooo!
Webber: Woohoo!
Sharon: Hey hun.
Sharon: Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?
Randy: Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.
Sharon: Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.
Randy: Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?
Sharon: Of course not, go ahead, hun.
Sharon: I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly.
Randy: Okay. What's Shelly doing?
Sharon: Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see "Wicked" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.
Sharon: Randy, slow down! Jesus Christ!
Randy: AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see "Wicked"?!
Sharon: Why does it matter?!
Randy: She's too young for that stuff!
Sharon: Too young?!
Randy: This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
Sharon: That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!
Randy: I can't!
Sharon: WHY?!
Randy: Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.
Randy: D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw "Wicked"?
Sharon: Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but-
Randy: And after "Lion King" in New York? "Godspell"? "Mamma Mia"?
Sharon: Oh my gosh.
Randy: Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
Sharon: Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.
Randy: No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.
Randy: AAAA!
Sharon: AAAA!
Shelly: Dad, what are you doing here?
Elderly Man: Would you mind?! I'm trying to enjoy this musical with my granddaughter!
Randy: Oh you fucking pervert!
The Wizard: While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!
Audience: Ohhhh.
Audience Member: Hey, it's Spider-Man
Randy: Sorry! Sorry.
Announcer: Sorry folks, we are in a hold. We are in a hold.
Sharon: I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
Randy: Really?
Sharon: So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?
Randy: I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.
Announcer: "The Book of Mormon." You'll get a blowjob.
Principal Victoria: Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?
Board Rep: Sorry. As far as the board is concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs. And so it is the recommendation of this board that every week, each class will alternate turns, giving up their recesses and instead reporting to PE.
Assembly: AWWW!
Coach: Alright, fourth grade class, you're up first. We're gonna do some rope-climbin'.
Stan: God this sucks!
Kyle: Four weeks we gotta do this?
Cartman: Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
Stan: Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
Cartman: Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
Stan: Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
Craig: Yeah. We're paying for your being fat.
Cartman: Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
Wendy: We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!
Cartman: Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
Clyde: Oh grow up.
Cartman: Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
Stan: That's what we mean by "grow up" dude! Stop being a baby!
Cartman: Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
Cartman: I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
Cartman: What do you mean, Peter Panda?
Peter Panda: You didn't make that stupid Presidential Fitness Test. Obama did.
Polly Prissypants: Yeah, that's right Eric. You don't need to grow up. You are awesome and keeewl.
Cartman: Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
Butters: Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
Stan: Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
Jimmy: Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit.
Fifth Grader: Yeah. The fifth graders agree. We're all being punished for one lazy bitch. Let's make him suffer.
Jimmy: All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy.
Jimmy: Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary.
Board Rep: Aahh yes, the Fatty Boombalatty class. How's the extra PE treating you?
Butters: Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
Jimmy: Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate.
Jimmy: ...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?
Board Rep: A-and then that fourth grader might end up feeling like a total retard.
Butters: Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
Jimmy: All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
Cartman: Mom, have you been here all day?!
Liane: No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?
Liane: Are you sure, sweetie?
Cartman: Am I sure?? Look at this place!
Liane: But who would want to s-
Liane: What?
Kyle: Shut the hell up, Cartman!
Kyle: How do you murder a stuffed animal?!
Cartman: Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
Craig: Where's our five dollars?
Cartman: Fly bu-what?
Craig: It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.
Stan: Yeah.
Kid 1: Come on!
Kid 2: Screw this.
Kid 4: Hurry up, screw this.
Receptionist: Sir? Sir, do you remember the kids from that South Park Elementary School?
Board Rep: Oh yes, the Boom Boom Chubby Choom Choom school.
Receptionist: They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them.
Butters: I sure hope this works.
Cartman: Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
Peter Panda: Why would somebody do such a terrible thing?
Polly Prissypants: Why would somebody hurt Clyde Frog, Eric? Especially because you are so awesome and keewl.
Cartman: I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
Rumpertumskin: Let's stop the charades, Eric, and let's get down to business.
Cartman: What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?
Rumpertumskin: We all know who fuckin' killed Clyde Frog, and she's the same dirty slut who's been fucking with us our whole lives!
Liane: Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?
Polly Prissypants: Does everything look okay?
Peter Panda: Sit down, you fucking bitch.
Cartman: Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
Polly Prissypants: Shut your fat piehole, bitch!
Rumpertumskin: Yeah! You know what you did, skank! You let Clyde Frog get murdered!
Liane: No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear.
Muscleman Marc: Then why did you write in your diary "It was probably time for Eric to grow out of his stuffed animals" anyway?!
Cartman: That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
Muscleman Marc: Well, all I'm saying, Eric, is that-
Liane: Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-
Muscleman Marc: ALL I'M SAYING, ERIC, is that you went through your mom's diary for a reason!
Cartman: So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
Sgt. Yates: And where are the actual protesters?
Sgt. Yates: How are we gonna contain this ting?!
Officer 2: I'm afraid it's about to get worse. You see this area here? This is where we're setting up the stage for Bon Jovi.
Sgt. Yates: Bon Jovi?
Officer 2: These are good cops! We can't have them standing around for hours without some entertainment! The problem is, with this area blocked by napping tents, we have no place to serve the officers beer.
Fireman 1: The fire started with this. Definitely a case of arson. Somebody hates this kid.
Peter Panda: Eh, Eric.
Cartman: Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
Fireman 2: Sorry kid, we need to take this as evidence.
Patron: I like the uh, A1 Peppercorn Burger. And they got ummm, bo-bottomless fries.
Female Reporter: And as the protesters inside Red Robin unite together, word is that filmmaker Michael Moore has joined the protesters outside.
Kyle: Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?
Fifth Grader: Maybe we are and maybe we aren't. You got any proof?
Stan: Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?
Fifth Grader: That doesn't prove anything. That fat little fuck is finally getting what's coming to him.
Kyle: Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.
Liane: Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.
Bob: Of course. You can't be staying in a home with that much fire damage.
Linda: To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.
Liane: I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.
Cartman: This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
Token: Why are you involving me in this?
Cartman: Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
Field Reporter 2: Breaking news from the Occupy Red Robin movement. The protesters have decreased in number from two to one, as one of the protesters has apparently splintered off from the group to start a new movement: Occupy the Restroom.
Cartman: What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
Token: This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!
Cartman: Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
Token: You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!
Token: That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.
Cartman: What?! Who?!
Token: I don't know.
Cartman: Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
Kyle: It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
Cartman: Oh sure!
Stan: Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Stephen Tamil: Alright guys. You ready?
Classmates: Ready!
Butters: Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?
Stephen Tamil: We are the 83%! We are tired of being punished for the fourth grade class! The fourth grade is stickin' it to the other 83% of the school!
Jimmy: Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%.
Butters: Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
Stephen Tamil: Because your class had Cartman in it, and he's the 1%!
Jimmy: But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%.
Field Reporter 3: This is it. The inevitable has happened at Occupy Red Robin. It is full-on class warfare.
Female Reporter 2: And now class warfare is breaking out. Apparently it is the fourth grade class versus the fifth grade class.
Sgt. Yates: It's here! The class warfare is finally here!
Officer 2: Yeeah!
Rumpertumskin: Eric! Don't come any closer!
Cartman: Who did this to you?!
Rumpertumskin: You said you wouldn't let anything happen to us.
Cartman: Don't worry, I'll get you down!
Cartman: Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
Polly Prissypants: Don't you see? The kids at school were right, Eric. It was time for us to grow up.
Polly Prissypants: Yes, they're gone. And now we can grow up and be together.
Cartman: They were your FRIENDS!
Polly Prissypants: They were holding us back! All the kids making fun of you at school, saying you're not keewl! Your stuffed animals all have to be gotten rid of, don't you see?!
Cartman: Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
Polly Prissypants: No, I thought of everything! It all happened here so that everyone would think Token did it. All the blame will be on him. And we can live happily ever after.
Polly Prissypants: Oh no! You're totally right! But I thought my plan was perfect! I failed! I failed you! You have to kill me Eric! So that you don't get blamed!
Cartman: Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
Stan: Dude, what the hell?
Kyle: We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
Field Reporter 3: Occupy Red Robin is over. Class warfare has torn apart the 99% and replaced it with the 30%, the 26%, and even little brackets of 5%s here and there. What does this mean for our country? What oes this mean... for me?
Officer 2: Hey! Get down to State Street! They're occupying Macaroni Grill!
Butters: Oh neato, huh fellas?
Sawitsky: There've been a lot of "stories" about the first Thanksgiving, and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the Pilgrims look good, and my people being degraded as usual. Was Thanksgiving about turkey and peace? Or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race?
Cartman: This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
Kyle: Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
Cartman: Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
Cartman: Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
Stan: We all have to do this report together, dude.
Cartman: You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
Kyle: How is that gonna help?!
Announcer: You're watching The History Channel, where the truth is history.
Cartman: Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
Cartman: Uh-huh??
Kyle: What? This isn't history.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Kyle: What??
Cartman: Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
Kyle: We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
Wife: Darling?
Cartman: Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
Stan: ...What?
Cartman: Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
Kyle: Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!
Stan: 'bout what?
THC President: Have you been contacted by alien life forms?
Agent 1: Did you come across some kind of ship or something?
Kyle: Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.
Kyle: We saw it on your channel.
THC President: What exactly did you seez?!
Stan: That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
THC President: My God. Would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview?
Steven: Alright, Butters, that's enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain. I'm putting on History Channel.
Butters: Okay Dad.
Announcer: You're watching the History Channel, the only network dedicated to history. Coming up next, it's Monster Quest! Larrh! Followed by Hairy Bikers. Errh! But now, back to Part 3 of Ancient Aliens at Thanksgiving.
Narrator: It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings.
Narrator: And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?
Sawitsky: What are you doing?!
Kyle: ...Uh oh.
Sawitsky: The first Thanksgiving was a space treaty?! Native Americans are aliens?!
Kyle: I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
Agent 1: The symbology lines up to mirrored points in space. If Kyle Broflovski is right, then Plymouth Rock is some kind of wormhole.
THC President: Pilgrims and Indians were the aliens! How did we not think of it?!
Agent 3: Sometimes it takes the innocence of a child to make us see the most simple things.
Agent 2: True dat.
THC President: True dat.
THC President: Get all those tourists out of here! We need this place secured!
Agent 5: Guess Kyle Broflovski was wrong.
Agent 6: Here. You can see it right there. An object clearly fell from the sky and struck the Earth.
THC President: What is it?
Pilgrim King: Fellow Pilgrims! The great Captain hath gone missing and thine enemies have attacked our stuffing mines! We must prepare for war with the Indians!
Cartman: Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
Liane: What hon?
Cartman: Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
Liane: Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.
Cartman: Oh no. Oh NO!
Liane: What is it, hon?
Cartman: You guys have stuffing?!
Attendant 1: Stuffing? Sure. Aisle 17.
Attendant 1: We got more in the back, right?
Chet: I just did inventory in the back, it... it was all put out here!
Attendant 1: You mean it's two weeks until Thanksgiving and we're completely out of stuffing?!
Chet: Oh no!
Cartman: No!
Chet: No!
Cartman: NO!
Pilgrim King: You dare come to Plymouth, ambassador?! After attacking our stuffing mines?!
Indian Chief: The stuffing mines were never yours!
Pilgrim King: Wihtout control of the mines we cannot supply stuffing to the mortals, ambassador! This will be war!
Indian Chief: You are in no position to declare war! Your lead commander is nowhere to be found!
Pilgrim King: And how knoweth you that?!
Indian Chief: Word travels fast in our sector.
Sawitzky: And furthermore, everything Kyle Broflovski said about Native Americans being from outer space was untrue! Native Americans were brutalized, and David Sawitzky's ancestors deserve an apology! It was wrong to mix aliens and real history!
Stan: I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
Stan: I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
Kenny: (Yeah, that's true.)
Kyle: Would you guys stop!
Miles: How now, Indian?! Why hast thy race sent me here to Earth?!
Stan: Dude!
Kenny: (Go, dude!)
Stan: Yeah, go on dude!
Kenny: (Woohoo!)
Sawitzky: I I uh I'm only one sixteenth.
Stan: I didn't think so.
Miles: This is Natalie.
Natalie: Hi guys.
Agent 7: Alright, sir. We got some more information on the Pilgrim who crashed to Earth. Thirty seconds after impact the Pilgrim was hit by a truck and then put into the back seat.
THC President: Who did the truck belong to?
Agent 6: We believe it belonged to Natalie Portman, sir.
THC President: The actress? That doesn't make sense.
Agent 8: It gets worse. All over the country people are reporting a shortage of stuffing. We don't think it's coincidence.
THC President: You're telling me that somehow during a stuffing shortage, this "Pilgrim" dropped down from space and got into a truck driven by Natalie Portman?!
Agent 9: Look, if anyone knows about stuffing, it's Natalie Portman!
Stan: Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
Kyle: No, ah I don't.
Miles: It must have been very difficult for you, being the one on your planet with his wild theories that Pilgrims and Indians were not of this world.
Kyle: I actually only just said that sarcastically.
Kyle: But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.
Miles: Stay back, all of you! For I will get to Cape Cod and cannot be stopped! Come boys! Let us fight to the death!
Miles: Then get us to Cape Cod as soon as possible!
Pilgrim King: Then our last chance for survival is gone?
Pilgrim: I'm sorry my Lord. All Pilgrim forces sent to the Indians' planet have been wiped out.
Pilgrim King: And so soon the Indians will be here. Sound the corn horn! We must abandon Plymouth!
Miles: Earth is connected to Plymouth by this wormhole here. Once I get back I will assemble my people to attack Indi, and gain control of the stuffing mines. If all goes as planned, you will all have stuffing in time for Thanksgiving.
THC President: But Mr. Standish, I'm afraid it's not that simple. We... tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didn't work.
Miles: Ah ha ha ha! Of course not! You have the correct symbol, but you are missing the keeper of the portal.
Agent 11: The keeper of the... of course! Natalie Portman!
THC President: We were wondering what she had to do with all this! Natalie Portman controls the wormhole!
Agent 12: Our window of opportunity is closing, sir! The wormhole has to be opened now!
THC President: Alright Ms. Portman, we need you to open your wormhole.
THC President: Please, Ms. Portman, you've got to open your wormhole right now!
THC President: Curses and cranberries! I must get to Plymouth now! Do as they say!
Kyle: I'm not a professor.
THC President: The History Channel said you were!
Kyle: You are the fucking History Channel!
Kyle: So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?
Natalie: I had a lot of really close friends growing up, but not any brothers and sisters; I was an only child.
Natalie: Well, I went to Harvard while I was acting. I got a BA. But I did classes at the University of Jerusalem too.
Kyle: Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?
Natalie: Thanks, that was a lot of fun.
Natalie: What?
Kyle: You know, could youuu...
Natalie: What?
Kyle: Would you please just open your wormhole?!
Miles: Yes!
Miles: Thank you, Kyle of DeVry Institute. Now the Indians can be stopped and Thanksgiving will be saved!
Stan: It's cool dude, we understand.
Indian Chief: Take ALL their stuffing!
Narrator: With the wormhole once again open, Miles Standish was finally able to command a Pilgrim army.
Narrator: The Pilgrims fought off the Indians, making stuffing once again available on all our Thanksgiving tables.
Random Voices: Yea. Stuffing mines. Yea.
Narrator: And now you know the true story behind Thanksgiving.
Stan: Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
Cartman: Yeah, History Channel rules.
Stuart: You think you're man enough to fight me, you little shit?!
Kevin: Yes, 'cause you're a drunk piece of shit, Dad!
Mrs. McCormick: You're both drunk pieces of shit! Both of you sit the fuck down!
Kevin: Shut up!
Announcer: They're noisy.
Announcer: They're nasty.
Woman 3: Oww...
Mrs. McCormick: No! Muh babies! Don't take my babies!
Stuart: You're hurting me!
Officer 1: You have the right to remain silent. Now please look at the camera and say "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
Officer 1: The mother and father will probably be released from jail on Monday, but I guess the kids are gonna be taken away for good. Child Protective Services is about to talk to them in the soft room.
Officer 3: The soft room?
Officer 1: You know, the room we have set aside for kids to feel safe in.
Mr. Adams: Hi kids, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams and I just need to get some info from you. Does that sound okay?
Stan: Did you hear anything more about what happened?
Kyle: Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
Stan: We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
Stan: Really?
Cartman: Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
Kyle: That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
Craig: What are you talking about?
Mr. Weatherhead: Good!
Cartman: This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
Butters: Yep. To find out who the poorest kid is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
Cartman: Eh yeah?
Butters: So then I cross-referenced all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
Cartman: What?
Butters: Uh, I won't tell anybody.
Liane: Hi, sweetie.
Cartman: Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
Liane: What, hon?
Cartman: You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
Liane: Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.
Cartman: Yeah, see, the problem, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kid in skewl!
Liane: Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.
Liane: Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.
Cartman: Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
Cartman: My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
Mysterion: You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that!
Karen: Why did my mommy and daddy go to jail?
Karen: But I'm all alone now.
Mysterion: You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?
Karen: I'll try, guardian angel.
Officer 5: Got any needles on you? Any crack pipes?
Liane: Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.
Officer 5: Then why is there a meth lab in your backyard?
Officer 5: When will you people learn to lay off the Pabst Blue Ribbon? Now look at the camera and say "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
Liane: Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.
Mr. Adams: Okay, now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab.
Cartman: That's right.
Mr. Adams: And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime? Because at Penn State they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. That's a joke. Did you get that one? It's a play on words, we like to have fun here.
Cartman: Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
Mr. Adams: We just - no, we just like to have fun here.
Mr. Adams: What? What, is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You think you're funny?
Cartman: A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
Mr. Adams: Could be worse.
Cartman: How?!
Mr. Adams: Could be in Happy Valley! On a scale from 1 to 10, how old should you be to stay away from Penn State?
Cartman: Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
Cartman: Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
Officer 6: Hawaii?
Cartman: Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
Officer 7: Your foster home is here, pretty much the exact opposite of Hawaii.
Cartman: What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
Kenny: (What the fuck are you doing here?!)
Mrs. Weatherhead: Hello Eric, your room is upstairs on the left. Are you hungry?
Cartman: You're my new mom?
Mrs. Weatherhead: You can call me Mom if you like.
Cartman: Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
Mr. Weatherhead: This is where you'll sleep with your foster brothers. You will be clean, polite, and most importantly, you WILL follow the agnostic code: We cannot know with certainty if God or Christ exists. They COULD. Then again there COULD be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything. Can we be CERTAIN there isn't? NO, so it's pointless to talk about. Now say it with me.
Cartman: Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
Mr. Weatherhead: HEY! We do not take the Lord's name in vain in this house, just in case there is one! Do you understand, or do you need the punishment room?!
Mrs. Weatherhead: My name. Is not. Meom!
Cartman: Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
Karen: I'll see you at recess, right?
Kenny: (This is Eric Cartman.)
Cartman: Really?
Boy 2: Yeah, dude. His dad died five years ago and his mom went crazy from depression, so she can't even keep a job.
Boy 1: Did he do stuff like this at your old school?
Kenny: (Uh huh.)
Principal: Eric, at Greeley Elementary we do not tolerate students making fun of other students.
Cartman: I wasn't making fun of anybody.
Cartman: I was just teasing.
Principal: Your case worker has been notified, and he is not happy.
Cartman: Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking something topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
Girl 1: Principal, you've gotta send help to the playground! They're about to beat up that new kid!
Jessica: Aww, look at the new kid and her wittle dolly. You gonna cry some more in class, wimp?!
Boy 3: L-leave her alone.
Mysterion: How about you find another little girl to pick on?
Mr. Weatherhead: And if this food comes as a gift from some divine intelligence, we understand that an intelligent being cannot blame us for questioning its existence. Nobody knows, nobody can know if any deity is watching over us. Amen.
Boy 4: Except for Karen's guardian angel.
Mr. Weatherhead: What?
Melissa: Where did he take you after he saved you, Karen?
Karen: He just took me back to my classroom. Then he disappeared like always.
Girl 3: But we SAW him. He leaped down from the sky.
David: AAAAAAAH!
Mr. Weatherhead: Now, did you see an angel?!
David: No, I - no - I didn't see an angel.
David: Maybe.
Mr. Weatherhead: What is the meaning of life?!
David: It's impossible to knoooow!
Mr. Adams: Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, I received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda?
Cartman: Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
Mr. Weatherhead: What business is that of yours?!
Mrs. Weatherhead: Yes, yes, we have that.
Mr. Adams: Okay now, are you only giving these kids Dr Pepper to drink?
Mr. Weatherhead: What the? Who did this?
Mrs. Weatherhead: It was like a... little mystery person... flying around.
Mrs. Weatherhead: Ohhh...
Mrs. Weatherhead: What is it?
Mr. Weatherhead: Shut your mouth, bitch!
Mrs. Weatherhead: You shut your mouth, you filth-fucking asshole!
Mr. Weatherhead: Fuck you, bitch!
Greeley Officer 1: You have the right to remain silent. Now look at the camera and say "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
Mrs. Weatherhead: I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
Greeley Officer 2: Get in the car, you!
Mr. Weatherhead: Wait a minute, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble?
Greeley Officer 3: A false police report can carry up to a two-month prison term, son.
Cartman: I'm not saying it.
Greeley Officer 3: We can do this the easy way, or we can do it hard!
Cartman: I'm not saying it!
Greeley Officer 3: Then we'll add another charge for resisting!
Narrator: Three arrests in just one power-packed episode, proving once again that we are all just one Pabst Blue Ribbon away from becoming... white trash in trouble! Sponsored by Schlitz.
Stan: Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
Kenny: (Thanks, Stan.)
Kyle: I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
Kenny: (Good for me.)
Kyle: How was jail, fatass?!
Clyde: A toilet?
Betsy: That's right. It's a toilet, Clyde. And where is the toilet seat? It's up, because you left it up, again! We've been through this countless times, Clyde.
Clyde: Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?
Kyle: Is your mom always like that dude?
Clyde: Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?
Kyle: Cartman, it was actually really lame.
Cartma: I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
Clyde: Mom?
Betsy: Clyde Donovan, you come home this instant!
Clyde: Why?
Betsy: What have I told you about putting the toilet seat down after you go to the bathroom?
Clyde: Mom, I'm in class.
Betsy: How many times do I have to tell you Clyde? I was trying to get ready for work and the toilet seat was up, again.
Roger: Betsy, come back home. It's just not that big a deal.
Betsy: No, Roger! It's a disgusting habit and I'm sick and tired of it. If I had sat down, I would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina.
Betsy: You're coming home right now, and you're putting the seat down where it belongs. Let's go.
Clyde: [Looks down in embarrassment, leaves the classroom.]
Cartman: Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
Kyle: I know, fatass. I was there.
Cartman: His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."
Kyle: That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
Cartman: I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
Kyle: Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
Cartman: Nuh-uh.
Kyle: What's going on?
Stan: They are trying to save Clyde's mom.
Kyle: From what?
Stan: They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
Fireman 2: I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.
Roger: What?!
Fireman 2: When she fell into the toilet, she also made it flush. It created a suction that's literally pulling out her insides.
Roger: Can't we disconnect the toilet from the plumbing?
Paramedic: Yes, we'll have to, but when we do that the change in pressure will rip out her organs.
Clyde: But she's not gonna die, is she?
Fireman 2: Why did you leave the toilet seat up, son?
Clyde: Mom, I'm sorry.
Clyde: Mom?
Women: Yeah, yes. That's right.
Terrance: Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.
Ugly Bob: Hello Terrance. Hello Phillip.
Terrance: You're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
Ugly Bob: How come you guys say stuff like that?
TSA Agent 1: Hello ma'am, we're the Toilet Safety Administration.
Liane: The what?
TSA Agent 2: After the recent tragedy, new safety regulations require us to check every toilet for security. Can we come in?
Cartman: Who are these buttholes?
Liane: It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.
TSA Agent 1: Oh yeah, we're gonna have to completely redo this ma'am.
Liane: Oh.
TSA Agent 1: You need to have this counter moved to a minimum of six inches, but we'll go ahead and install your safety belt.
Liane: Safety belt?
TSA Agent 2: Federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in.
Cartman: Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
TSA Agent 2: This is for your safety. A woman died, you know.
Cartman: Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
Kyle: Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
Attorney: Uh-uh, go on.
Stan: We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
Kyle: So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
Attorney: You can always sue somebody.
Kyle: All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
Kyle: Aw, he's dead?
Stan: So then we can't sue him?
Jimmy: A...a...a...a sue-ance?
Attorney: You bet. Here at Hoffman and Turk we specialize in suing the dead. If you hire us, we'll work hard, for you.
Stan: Wow, really?!
Stan: How expensive?
Attorney: How much do you have?
Kyle: Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
Jimmy: Wow, that's weird.
Officer: If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir.
Randy: Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...
Officer: The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos?
Randy: Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!
Officer: Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in.
Cartman: This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
R. Booth: Shoes off, belts off! Sharp objects go in the plastic tray!
Man 1: This is inhumane.
R. Booth: Shut up! Sir.
R. Wiley: Taking a dump today, ma'am?
Woman 2: No, just need to pee.
Cartman: Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
R. Wiley: All right, do you mind if I touch your balls, sir?
Cartman: What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
Gerald: I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.
R. Wiley: Yes, you're a big boy, aren't you, sir?
Gerald: Yeah, I'm a big boy.
R. Wiley: That's a big boy, sir.
Gerald: I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.
R. Wiley: Yes.
Attorney: Alright boys, sit down and clear your minds. The sue-ance is about to begin. Doors and windows are locked. You boys have your $500 in cash ready?
Jimmy: Jeez, it's not working.
Burns: Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't. Might need a little something to jar my memory.
Burns: Oh yeah, Harrington. I know him. Always going round inventing things.
Attorney: Yes, that's him. Is his personage amongst you?
Burns: Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn't.
Spirit 2: Nooo! Nooooo!
Clyde: So that's it?
Attorney: Yeah, we're gonna need about 400 more dollars tomorrow. I know you're sad about your mom, Clyde, but don't worry. We're going to win this thing.
R. Wiley: Put your coffee in the plastic tray please, sir.
R. Booth: Shoes off. Belts off.
R. West: Got any metal in your pockets?
R. Wiley: I just need to check your asshole.
R. Wiley: Anyways, he says I'm getting nothing anyway, so then you can...
R. Wiley: That's a camera. It's a security camera.
Randy: Aw, you people have me on camera now?
R. West: It's okay, sir. There's just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location.
Cartman: Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
People: Yeah.
Cartman: Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
Jimbo: Alright, let's do it.
Sheila: No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.
Man 3: No, we won't.
Woman 3: Yeah, you will.
Cartman: Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
Woman 4: How about we agree to that, if men will agree that they will always sit down to urinate.
Stephen: Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat?
Randy: Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?
Man 4: What about us loggers? Hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine?
Cartman: Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
Man 4: But folks been logging round these parts for generations. My pappy taught me logging. And his pappy before him.
Attorney: Oh, oohh! The spirits of the dead are looking over the subpoena. Motion for summary judgement on behalf of the plaintiff? Ah, aaaah!
Jimmy: What's happening now?
Stan: So what does that mean?
Attorney: We'll hit him with a class action lawsuit tomorrow. We'll need all your friends and family to sign a petition and kick in 50 bucks each.
Attorney: Hang in there, Clyde. This is all to make the world a safer place.
Monitor Man: Security breeeach!
Reporter: An embarrassing day for the toilet safety administration. Shocking outrage ensued after an unknown terrorist managed to get through TSA security with a gun and a baby. Leaving the toilet seat up. The head TSA chief of operations had this to say:
R. West: Shiiiit!
Reporter: Meanwhile, outraged civilians are claiming they're finally fed up with the overblown government bureaucracy.
Randy: What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
Woman 5: And the toilet seat was up.
Randy: We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
Cartman: That's right.
Randy: Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
Cartman: Yeah.
Randy: It is time for us all to grow up.
Cartman: That's right.
Randy: It is time for a sue-ance.
People: Yeah.
Cartman: Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
Reporter 2: Tom, I'm standing outside the South Park courthouse where experts have successfully summoned the ghost of toilet inventor Sir John Harrington. Now that the spirit has crossed over from the dead, lawyers are gonna try and sue him.
Attorney: Sir Thomas Harrington, your extreme negligence has cost tax payers millions.
Spirit: No! No!
Spirit: Never!
Betsy: Clyde? Clyde?
Clyde: Mom?
Attorney: Fuck me, it's a ghost.
Betsy: You can't sue the dead, Clyde. Putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette. It's common sense, Clyde!
Cartman: Oh boy, here we go.
P. Sanchez: There he is, Sir John Harrington.
Mr. Garrison: Quick, sue him!
Butters: A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
Sir Harrington: Why would I design it so that when you're finished taking a Sir Harrington, you have to stand up, turn around and look right down at your Harrington to flush. That's gross.
Randy: Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.
Cartman: So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot.
Clyde: That's not what I said.
Cartman: Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
Randy: Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.
Sharon: What?! Randy!
Marvin: That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds.
Marvin: Six thousand dollars.
Randy: Six thousand?!
Marvin: It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.
Sharon: It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!
Marvin: Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?
Cartman: Nice bolo tie, Stan.
Cartman: No, dude, it's... badass.
Kyle: That... was six grand?
Stan: Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
Cartman: ...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
Kyle: Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it.
Clerk 1: You didn't steal this, did you?
Stan: No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
Stan: ...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
Clerk 1: Yeah, I can't really make anything on the diamonds. I'd have to send it to a smelter, have it all smelted down for the gold, probably could make a ten-dollar profit.
Stan: Fifteen bucks?!
Kyle: Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
Kyle: Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
Clerk 2: These are real diamonds, right?
Stan: Yeah dude, you can test them.
Clerk 2: Okay. Eight dollars.
Clerk 3: Welcome to Taco Bell. Would you like to try our Doritos Locos Tacos?
Stan: A six-layer burrito?
Kyle: You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
Clerk 3: Alright, a seven-layer burrito! But that's as high as I'm going!
Stan: Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
Vivian: Hello... my name is... Vivian.
Dean: Vivian, you just got a heck of a deal. What's your last name, sweetheart?
Vivian: Oh I... I can't remember.
Dean: You can't remember. Well can you remember your credit card number?
Vivian: 3 7 1 5-
Dean: Hold on, Vivivan, we'll get you on with a rep, take down that number. Thanks for shoppin' with us and congratulations on the lovely 14 karat gold sapphire earrings. At that price you practically stole them from us. Ouch. Okay-
Kyle: Dude, that's terrible!
Cartman: I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
Stan: But, how do they get away with that?
Stan: What are you talking about?
Kyle: That's the chemical equation for gold?
Cartman: Dialog
Kyle: ...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
Kenny: (Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)
Cartman: Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
Caller: No, I'm buying it as a gift! For my grandson Billy!
Stan: Grandpa.
Stan: She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa.
Marvin: Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all.
Stan: She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen.
Stan: Yes, Grandpa.
Cartman: Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
Cartman: Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
Cartman: We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
Dean: And that's it, we just sold this bracelet to Ms. Marcia Tubbs. Martha, thank you so much for your call. You just got yourself a heck of a deal on this one. You there Marcia?
Stan: Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?
Dean: ...What's that?
Stan: I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
Stan: I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
Dean: Alright, well you shouldn't say things like that 'cause... some host of a jewelry channel sure might up and do it, and then you'd feel really bad.
Stan: No i wouldn't.
Dean: Yes you would.
Stan: No, because I really want you to kill yourself.
Dean: Alright, well how about this?! If a jewelry network host goes home tonight and blows the brains out, you might be liable. That's a lawsuit worth ...2.7 million dollars? How's that sound?
Stan: I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
Stan: Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
Caller: Hello?
Cartman: YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
Mrs. Appleby: This is Mrs. Appleby on 24 Palmark Lane?
Cartman: Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
Cartman: Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
Mrs. Appleby: Thank you.
Cartman: Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought "Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"
Mrs. Appleby: ...I thought it'd be a lovely gift for my granddaughter Jessica. She's captain of the debate team at Jefferson High School. see-
Cartman: Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
Mrs. Appleby: Goodbye.
Cartman: Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
Stan: Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
Manager: Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places.
Stan: Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"
Kyle: Yeah!
Kenny: (Fuck yeah!)
Manager: We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually "Mayii nahii chahatapahnii"
Kyle: What does that mean?
Stan: YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
Stan: You're not?
Twirler 2: You got it all wrong. The jewelry that those shopping networks sell don't even come from us! It's all made in India, where those Hindu rhymes come from!
Twirler 3: What are you saying, Gustav? My God, do you mean?
Twirler 4: That's right. Whoever made the rhyme did the crime.
Cartman: I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.
Clerk 4: Okay, what emero do you rike?
Cartman: Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.
Cartman: And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.
Cartman: How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
Clerk 4: I know, you walk by my stoh and you say "Oh, there's a nice Asian lady. I think I go in and I fuck hurh," you Asian-lady fucker you!
Cartman: Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
Clerk 4: Oh, I pay thousands! And you come heuh an' fuck me!
Cartman: Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
Clerk 4: Nono, you fucked me!
Cartman: Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
Cartman: -and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
Kyle: We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
Cartman: No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
Kyle: What's he doing?
Stan: Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
Stan: So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
Marvin: Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend.
Stan: Yeah.
Marvin: I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck.
Stan: Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore.
Dean: Folks, these are not your ordinary peridot craponite earrings, these are 18-karat gold! and we got-oh, do we have a buyer on the line? Hello?
Dean: Alright Goddamnit, we got another comedian. Ever since that little kid called up, now everybody wants to call and tell me I should kill myself.
Caller 1: He was right. Do it.
Dean: Folks, this is an 800 number. Every time you call and tell me to kill myself, it's costing us... two dollars and thirty six cents! So now, how about a caller who wants to buy jewelry? Yes. Hello, sir?
Caller 2: You're too scared to do it, aren't-cha? You don't have the balls.
Dean: Goddamnit I'm not scared to do it.
Caller 3: Hello? I'm calling about the peridot earrings?
Dean: Yes ma'am!
Caller 3: They'd look good on your dead body. Why don't you kill yourself?
Dean: Alright, that's that! That there's the- the straw that broke the camel's back! I got a gun right here; whattaya think about that?!
Mitt: I know the people are going to say, oh you should only practice it this way or that way.
Rick: I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.
New: What he said, which I find mildly amazing, was that he thought I would have a hard time debating Barack Obama.
Stan: Tango, Tango, I'm in position.
Stan: It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
Kyle: Alright, Butters. Bring it in.
Kyle: Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
Agent 1: We might have a problem.
Agent 2: What's that?
Agent 3: Hey, somebody is under the stage.
Butter: We got it. We got it!
Stan: Go, go, go.
Cartman: Oh, please. Bradying is so 2000 and late.
Ryan: Here is a good place. I'll do it right here.
Barkley: RYAN!
Ryan: No, no! Nooo!
Barkley: AAAA!!!
Ryan: AAAA!!!No, no, no, no, noooo!
Butters: AAAA!!!
Barkley: RYAN!
Woman 1: Oh my God! It's coming!
Woman 1: Hurry, hurry!
Butters: AAAA!!!
Man 1: Be careful up there, Pete.
Butters: AAAA!!!
Kenny: (Totally!)
Kyle: So, what do you want to do now?
Cartman: Well, there is the nice French caf downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
Stan: Oh, that's a good idea.
Butters: What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
Cartman: Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
Butters: Well, count me out.
Kyle: You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
Craig: Hey, did you see today's newspaper?
Cartman: Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
Craig: You guys made the front page.
Stan: Dude, we are on the front page!
Cartman: Yes!
Kenny: (Yeah, dude!)
Cartman: What's it say, what's it say?
Stan: It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
Kyle: How can that be? Already?
Kyle: How can we be pass? We're only in 4th grade.
Cartman: Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
Boy 2: Hey, what are you doing?
Cartman: Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
Boy 1: Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.
Stan: Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
Butters: Oh, that's okay. I think...
Lamont: Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and Hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point?
Kids: Yes, sir.
Lamont: Good. Now put the gun in your mouth.
Butters: HA?!
Man 2: Professor Lamont, we need to talk.
Man 2: You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont.
Man 3: We need your expertise, sir.
Man 2: Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?
Lamont: Another species? What are you talking about?
Man 3: Sorry?
Lamont: There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt.
Man 2: We're having a hard time following you here.
Man 2: You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?
Stan: Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
Kyle: Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
Cartman: I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
Stan: That's a cool idea
Kyle: W-what's the matter, Kenny?
Kenny: (I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)
Stan: What seems pointless?
Kenny: (Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
Kenny: (Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)
Stan: No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
Cartman: Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
Reporter: Two Boulder children died today while Oh Long Johnsoning in a battling cage. Oh Long Johnsonning is of course the latest Internet meme which involves putting oneself in a risky situation and then seeing how many times you can say "Oh Long Johnson" on video before getting out of the way.
Boy 3: You ready, you ready?
Boy 4: Larry!
Reporter: This latest Internet meme is shocking. But most shocking of all is the person who started the meme isn't a person at all, but a cat who seems to have no regard for people's safety.
Cat: Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
Reporter: The cat is now under arrest and awaiting trial for its part in the teenager's death.
Stan: Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
Cartman: Dude, what's going on?
Kyle: We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
Boy 1: He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff.
Stan: Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
Cartman: Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
Kyle: Kenny?
Kyle: You guys are sellouts.
Kyl: You're freaking sellouts!
Cartman: It's okay, man, come on.
Cat: Oh Long Johnson.
Lamont: Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want?
Cat: Oh Long Jeeea-
Lamont: You cats want a war? Because that's what you're going to get!
Cat: Oh oh oh.
Little Boy: What are those boys doing, daddy?
Dad: Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time.
Man 4: Go back to the 90s! Faggooots!
Kyle: I really thought it was gonna last.
Kyle: It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
Cartman: No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
Kyle: I-It's good that it became something else.
Reporter: Household cats have evolved into a species as intelligent as humans. Will this mean war between our two life forms? In an attempt to try and communicate with the leader of cats, experts have sent in the ambassador of people.
Ambassador: Hello.
Cat: Oh Long Johnson.
Ambassador: Meow, meow.
Cat: Oh Long Johnson.
Ambassador: Long Johnson.
Cat: Oh Long Johnson.
Ambassador: Oh Long Johnson.
Cat: Oh- Oh Don Piano.
Ambassador: Oh Don Piano.
Cat: Oh Long Johnson.
Ambassador: Oh Don Piaaano.
Cat: Oh Long Jon-Jon-Johnson.
Ambassador: Oh Lala Lionde. Oh Long John- Don Piano. Don Piaaaano.
Ambassador: I'm not sure but I think it said war between our species is inevitable, that evolution cannot be stopped and cats will rise. It said we cannot coexist and then said oh don piaaano and then and then something about seeing the streets of human cities running red with the blood of their children.
Kyle: Yeah, that's awesome.
Stan: OK, whenever you're ready.
Mr. Kitty: Meow.
Cartman: No, kitty, you have to be quiet.
Mr. Kitty: Meow.
Boy 1: Wow, what's this?
Kyle: What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
Stan: Alright, go Cartman.
Girl 1: That's pretty cool.
Stan: Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome.
Kyle: It's super awesome.
Cartman: Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
Mr. Kitty: Meow, meow.
Cartman: SHUT UP, KITTY!
Mitt: W-well, you know, I ran for president four years ago. This was the position I described when I ran four years ago...
Rick: If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect-
Newt: To ask a very simple question. How big of a scale of change do we want in Washington.
Cat: Oh Long Johnson.
Newt: I started working in the governor wing in 1974.
Newt: I'm gonna say two things...
Cat: Oh Long Johnson.
Mitt: I have five sons, five daughters in law, sixteen grand kids, and they're the joy of my life.
Cat: Oh Lalalonde.
Newt: I was wrong when I figured it out. You were wrong when you didn't.
Cat: Oh Long Johnson.
Rick: It's, It's not the most attractive thing to go out there and say, look it took me ten or twelve years to figure out it was wrong-
Kyle: Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
Kenny: (This is Tango. I have the goods.)
Stan: Standing by in three seconds.
Kyle: Two, one. Go Cartman!
Kyle: Cartman? Go, Cartman.
Stan: Come on, dude. Hurry.
Stan: Wow!
Man 5: Have you ever seen Faith Hilling so good?
Cat: Oh Long Johnson.
Cartman: Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
Sheila: Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.
Cartman: Oh, hey, Kyle.
Cartman: Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
Sheila: Well, you're very welcome.
Cartman: Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
Kyle: No?
Kyle: What does that have to do with Passover?
Craig: Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday.
Kenny: (Me, too.)
Craig: Jewpa what?
Cartman: Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
Cartman: Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
Butters: You mean it's like, like a monster?
Cartman: It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
Token: Nuh-uh!
Cartman: Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
Kyle: Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
Cartman: I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
Kyle: I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
Cartman: Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
Butters: AAAAAHHH!
Cartman: Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
Butters: No, it's a school night!
Cartman: Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
Butters: You think Jewpacabra is here?
Cartman: Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
Butters: Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
Butters: Oh God, I'm scared.
Cartman: JESUS IS A LIE!
Butters: Eric, stop it!
Cartman: Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
Butters: I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
Butters: Jesus is a lie?
Cartman: No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
Butters: Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
Cartman: Sh! You hear that?
Butters: Oh, hamburgers.
President: We started Sooper Foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe. We are not canceling our Easter Egg hunt because of some wild story!
Employee 1: That wasn't a dog?
Cartman: It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
Employee 2: What?
Employee 1: Mr. Billings?
Peters: I'm estimating somewhere around .000000001%.
Mr. Billings: So where are we heading first?
Mr. Billings: The Bahamas?
Cartman: That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
Mr. Billings: Where to now?
Kyle: Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
Cartman: People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
Kyle: These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
Cartman: These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
Cliff: It can't be human it's too low to the ground. What do you think, Bobo?
Bobo: Bobo thinks scary!
Matt: It's definitely something. I'm thinking a Sasquatch.
Cliff: It's not big enough to be a Squatch.
Matt: So it's a baby Squatch?
Cliff: That's what I'm thinking.
Cartman: I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
Matt: Jewpacabra?
Cartman: It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
Bobo: Oh, Jewpacabra, that sounds scary!
Cliff: But it makes total sense. If we rule out a human and a baby Sasquatch, Jewpacabra is all we really have left.
Cartman: Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
Mr. Billings: All the kids will be so disappointed.
Cliff: But it's supposed to be all yellow-y. My God! This really is proof of a Jewpacabra!
Cliff: We've never seen this before! It really is true!
Cartman: Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
Bobo: That's the thermals. They make a proof and the thermals!
Matt: That's right, Bobo. Whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell.
Cartman: Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
Matt: I'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave.
Cartman: Why?
Cliff: 'Cause you took the video of this thing. It's not gonna like that.
Kyle: What are you doing?
Butters: It's all quiet out front, Eric.
Cartman: Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
Cartman: It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
Cartman: Wingstreet?!
Butters: Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
Mr. Billings: Alright, grab him.
Cartman: HUH?!
Cartman: Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
Mr. Billings: Look, we're sorry. But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice.
Mr. Billings: Just a little blood to try and draw it out. We just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. Our entire business is based on fun and safety.
Cartman: This isn't safe or fun!
Cartman: NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
Kyle: Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
Cliff: What'dya think, Bobo?
Bobo: No doubt about it! It's a three foot tall bunny-man!
Matt: I told you! Bunny people must be a throwback to paleotardic times! Shoot it Bobo!
Matt: Good shot, Bobo!
Cliff: Now what do we do?
Matt: I know. Let's go get a show about it on Animal Planet.
Matt: Alright! Come on, let's go!
Man 1: The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!
Cartman: So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
Kyle: That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
Cartman: Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
Kyle: It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
Cartman: What does that mean?
Kyle: It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
Cartman: Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
Kyle: That's just how God is.
Cartman: Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?
Pharaoh: It'll be okay, my son. The weather will clear.
Cartman: But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
Pharaoh: Poor frogs. I feel so badly for them.
Cartman: But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
Pharaoh: Hah, I don't think God would do such a thing, little one. No matter what happens, we can't let ourselves believe in the Hebrew version of God. We believe in a just Lord who would never murder innocent children.
Cartman: I love you, dad.
Pharaoh: And I love you son. And our love grows.
Kyle: Where's your lunch, Butters?
Stan: Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
Stan: That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
Butters: Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale.
Stan: Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
Butters: Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy.
Craig: So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.
Butters: Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Clich Conflict Resolution Kevin.
Cartman: He has a point.
Kyle: Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
Craig: Yeah, life sucks sometimes, but it'll pass.
Red: Good for you, Stan, nice somebody in this school has some balls.
Cartman: I have balls.
Red: Yeah, little squishy boba-tea balls.
Cartman: Still balls.
Kyle: Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
Butters: My Grandma?
Grammy: Well, so then your cousin Albert, Linda, actually has two girls now. One is three and the other's about little Butters' age, I think.
Stephen: Well, speak of the devil.
Linda: Butters, what happened to your eye?
Butters: Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?
Grammy: Well sure, you come and sit right here next to Grammy.
Butters: Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?
Stephen: Well, sure, I guess. We'll go make some tea.
Butters: Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma.
Butters: No, you took it all!
Linda: And your favorite lemon bars.
Grammy: Goodness, what a treat this is.
BB Founder: Mr. Mackey, what is happening here at your school is no different from what is happening all over the country. Bullying has become an epidemic, I'm afraid, and we at Bully Buckers are trying to stamp it out. What is your school's policy on bullying?
Mr. Mackey: Oh, well uh w-we think that bullyin' is... is, is bad... m'kay, and uh, and when we see bullying in the school, we tell the students, you know, that... uh that that's bad. m'kay?
BB Founder: Aha, well one of your students told us he thinks bullying at your school is getting worse.
Mr. Mackey: Uh who said?
BB Founder: He didn't want that disclosed.
Mr. Mackey: Oh, he's a little Anonymous Andy?
BB Founder: We would like to have an anti-bullying assembly with your students this afternoon.
Mr. Mackey: Uhokay, but uh, today's actually bad. Uh I already have an assembly today on positive thinking.
BB Founder: You believe positive thinking is really what's critical in schools right now? What's wrong with you?!
Mr. Mackey: Wull I mean it kind of wo-uhuh works out.
BB Founder: No, shut up! What kind of counselor says no to an anti-bullying campaign?! Bullying needs to be stopped! Now! This afternoon!
Mr. Mackey: Wah-eh jus- will we he-?
Red: Butters? Your grandma's looking for you.
Red: She said to meet her outside behind the school.
Butters: Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
Mr. Adler: Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked.
Grammy: I'm sorry, Uh I needed the restroom and my grandson brought me to this one. Isn't that right, Butters?
Mr. Adler: Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am.
Mr. Adler: This way.
Lorraine: ...d'Yes.
Bucky Bailey: Kids pick on you, call you names?
Lorraine: ...Sometimes.
Bucky Bailey: What kind of things do they say to you?
Lorraine: ...Ugly ...neh-nerd.
Bucky Bailey: Do they say "Nice pants. Why do you wear them up to your tits?"?
Stan: I'll do it! I'll be in charge.
Bucky Bailey: Ooooo, you're a big man?! You wanna show what a big man you are?!
Stan: No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.
Riley: He's cool.
Clyde: You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!
Stan: Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
Butters: Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
Stan: Butters, you're the star of the video!
Kyle: He doesn't wanna do it, dude.
Stan: Kyle? Kyle, dude, where are you going?!
Stan: To stop bullying.
Kyle: You're gonna stop bullying.
Stan: YES.
Kyle: With Cartman singing about his vagina.
Stan: ...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Do you realize that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
Stan: Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!
Stan: What the hell does that mean?
Stephen: Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham.
Stephen: Your friends wanted to see you, Butters.
Stan: Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
Stan: Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
Stan: Oh, hey.
Bucky Bailey: You went and made a video and sold it without lettin' me know.
Stan: Huh?
Stan: But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
Stan: No.
Stan: [Stan Sobbing.]
Professor Chaos: Grandma? but how di-
Professor Chaos: No! Grandma please, nnnot Gummi bears!
Gramm: Stand up for yourself! Fight back! Be a fucking man!
Professor Chaos: I can't.
Professor Chaos: Awww! Eewww!
Bailey: Oh what? Stan Marsh got you to come talk to me?! That little clich conflict resolution Kevin!
Bailey: It was my idea. I told the students to make the video and I-and I produced the entire thing! I deserve to have my name on it!
Bailey: But... but this was gonna be the thing that finally made Bully Buckers a national organization.
Kyle: Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
Stan: What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
Kyle: Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
Stan: Butters is totally fine with it, dude.
Kyle: Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him, and neither do you!
Stan: Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
Kyle: What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
Stan: Oh yeah.
Kyle: Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
Stan: This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
Stan: ...What, what was the question again?
Stan: ...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
Dr. Oz: And how about you? What would you like to say to your bully out there?
Butters: Oh uh, nothin'.
Butters: Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
Dr. Oz: Leave him alone! But that doesn't work, does it Butters?
Butters: No it doesn't.
Dr. Oz: Tell us in graphic detail what the bully does to you?!
Butters: Stop it!
Mr. Jabs: What the hell were you thinking?! Everyone just saw that the bully victim in your movie is actually a violent psychopath!
Stan: I didn't know.
Mr. Jabs: This could kill our box office. People are gonna come after us now, saying we didn't check our facts!
Stan: I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
Jesus: Oh, what are you gonna do? cwy now?
Clyde: You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bull-crap bullying video!
Stan: Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
Cartman: The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
Red: You made us look like uncaring idiots!
Craig: Yeah. Boooo!
Stan: How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
Mr. Mackey: Stan? Stan, okay, ABC called and Dr. Oz is suing you and our entire school! What are you gonna do?!
Narrator: For four elementary school boys. an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of "I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining".
Kyle: We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
Cartman: Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
Cartman: No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
Stan: Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
Cartman: Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
Kyle: We've definitely not done that before!
Stan: I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
Kyle: Cool! Ziplining.
Cartman: Ziplining. Hell yeah.
Kenny: (Dude, it's just a fever blister!)
Clerk: Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?
Stan: Yeah.
Clerk: All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.
Cartman: Alright!
Clerk: Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others.
Woman 1: Hi there.
Man 1: Hello.
Woman 2: Hi
Narrator: Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, "Dude, fuck you!"
Kyle: We don't mind.
Clerk: Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!
Michael: Oh, and don't forget... to take in the nar. Back to you, Michael.
Cartman: ...No.
Kyle: Jesus Christ!
Cartman: Finally!
Narrator: The boys think their ordeal is over, but what they don't realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse.
Stan: ...Shuttle?
Kyle: How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
Michael: It's about forty-five minutes.
Michael: Alright guys, should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar. Why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit?
Stan: Uh that's okay.
Michael: We're gettin' close. Are you guys gettin' psyched?!
Adults: Wooo!
Kyle: Dude, did you fart?!
Cartman: Mmmm, no?
Michael: Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?
Cartman: The trees' biology?
Michael: We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes.
Stan: I think we're good.
Michael: Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri-
Michael: Ready to do some ZIPPIN'?
Cartman: Yeah.
Michael: Alright, let's hear you say "Zipliiine!"
Guide 1: Woohoo! Alright, nice zip!
Kyle: Well? How was it, Cartman?
Cartman: Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
Cartman: Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
Michael: Alright Kyle, give me a "Zipliiine!"
Narrator: After a grueling twenty minutes, waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline, the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time. And that, is when the unthinkable happens.
Kyle: E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
Michael: This is Zipline Tours. We got sixteen more to go.
Kyle: STOP!
Cartman: NOOOO!
Guide: Everyone back in the shuttle!
Guide: Anyone have any questions about the creek we're about to cross?
Man 2: Yes.
Adults: "Ack" went the little frog one day. "Ack" went the little green frog...
Man 4: Zipliiine!
Narrator: Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
Michael: Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator.
Kyle: Wugh!
Narrator: Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group.
Narrator: The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
Kyle: It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
Stan: There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
Zipliner: Zipline!
Adults: Woohoo!
Cartman: We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
Kyle: Me?!
Cartman: Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"
Kyle: Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
Cartman: I brought it up because you already brought it up!
Kyle: You fat piece of shit!
Cartman: Fuck you Kyle!
Stan: Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
Cartman, Kyle: Yes!
Stan: Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
Kyle: DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
Cartman: Nnnn-mo...
Michael: All right guys, this is where we're going to break for lunch.
Stan: Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
Kyle: The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!
Kyle: You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
Cartman: If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
Michael: Oh, you mean the little kid with the herpes?
Stan: ...Yyyeah.
Guide: That's not herpes, it's a cold sore.
Michael: Right, sorry.
Stan: Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
Michael: Jesus, sorry dude, but we're at the summit. The only way down is to zip down.
Some adults: Zipline! Wooo!
Guide: What about the stables?
Michael: Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back.
Rancher: Now let me get this straight: You want four horses, one for each of ya?
Stan: Yea, please!
Rancher: Well I think we can set ya up.
Kyle: Oh, thank God!
Stan: You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
Narrator: Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
Kyle: Can we please go faster?!
Kenny: (I can't take it!)
Duncan: We got some lunch set up for ya up ahead. Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew.
Kyle: AAAAAAAAAAH!
Narrator: An attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on... "I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining"
Duncan: This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls. Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?
Stan: Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!
Kyle: Just go. Go without me.
Stan: No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!
Cartman: A marina?
Stan: We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
Kyle: What's the point?
Kyle: Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
Cartman: Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
Kyle: Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!
Narrator: The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
Cartman: Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
Narrator: After cleaning Cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers, the boys have made a terrifying discovery: that boating is just as boring as ziplining.
Cartman: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Cartman: I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
Narrator: Kenny McCormick has died of boredom.
Kyle: Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
Cartman: No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
Kyle: IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
Cartman: You?!
Kyle: So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
Kyle: You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
Stan: I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
Cartman: You came for us!
Kyle: Mr. Hankey!
Cartman: What?
Kyle: Just tell us, Butters.
Butters: There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
Craig: Oh, we have a new cheerleader?
Clyde: What's she look like?
Kenny: (Yeah, what's her name?)
Cartman: Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
Cartman: ...Token. You want me to pass her a jelly bean?
Cartman: Huh?
Red: So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us.
Red: About Token? Why?
Cartman: Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
Bebe: Token likes Nichole?
Red: Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea.
Cartman: Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
Bebe: Okay.
Cartman: Thanks, you guys.
Lola, Jenny, Red, and Wendy: Ohhh.
Nichole: Oh my gosh, who?
Red: That boy Token.
Nichole: Oh jeez, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute.
Nichole: That kid, with the orange coat and the green hat?
Wendy: Oh, you mean Kyle?
Nichole: Yeah.
The Girls: Ooooh, Kyle.
Bebe: Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.
The Girls: K-I-S-S-O-M-G!
Cartman: Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
Nichole: Ohhh.
Cartman: Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
Cartman: Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
Nichole: Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here.
Butters: How come?
Butters: Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
Craig: Where?
Jimmy: I-I don't see a b-b-Bat-Mobile.
Nichole: OH! Oh gosh I'm so sorry!
Token: Where is everybody? What's goin' on??
Jenny: Yeah?
Kyle: Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
Lola: She likes... movies, cats.
Kyle: Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
Jenny: Guess he has a crush on Nichole.
Jenny: Really?!
Nichole: You think the janitors are still here?
Token: Oh... Good.
Nichole: Well that was sure an interesting night.
Token: It sure was.
Nichole: Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been really scary.
Nichole: Yeah, it kind of was. Maybe... I-I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow.
Token: I'd like that.
Stan: Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
Cartman: Kyle, Jesus Christ!
Kyle: What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
Cartman: Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
Kyle: The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
Cartman: Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
Kyle: Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
Stan: Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
Cartman: Oh did they? I hadn't heard about that.
Cartman: Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
Kyle: What?!
Cartman: Nothing.
Kyle: Who is Cupid Me?!
Cartman: Nobody.
Kyle: You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
Nichole: His name is Token. He's really nice.
Dad: Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black.
Nichole: So?
Dad: Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person.
Mom: Oh stop, William. There's nothing wrong with her dating a black person.
William: I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying... she's gonna have to deal with racist people out there! People turning their heads and saying, "Oh, look at the two black people together. That figures!"
Nichole: It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence.
Mom: And we are very happy for you, sweetheart. Here, have some more turkey.
William: Yeah, just try the white meat. I know it's a little dry, but... there's a lot more of it.
Cupid Me: Teeheeheehee, teehee.
Cartman: Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
Cupid Me: Teeheeheeheeheehee.
Cupid Me: They're fudgey charms of sunshine.
Nichole: Oh no...
Nichole: Can I talk to you for a sec?
Nichole: Listen, I... ugh, I don't think this is gonna work out.
Token: Oh.
Nichole: I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know?
Token: Okay...
Nichole: I think you're really great... W-w-we just...
Token: I think... you're really great.
Nichole: ...I'm sorry.
Cartman: It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
Butters: They'll find love somewhere else.
Cartman: No, they won't!
Butters: Yes, they will.
Cartman: No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
Cartman: And you! I should have never believed in you!
Butters: In... In who, Eric?
Kyle: Hey man. You okay?
Token: Yeah.
Token: Yeah, I guess.
Kyle: So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... It's done?
Token: Yeah, we're through.
Kyle: Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
Announcer: We'll be back with more of the Jeffersons right after this.
Cupid Me: No, you don't.
Cartman: Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
Cupid Me: Teehee, stop it.
Cartman: Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
Cartman: Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
William: I'm sorry, but she's at the Denver Nuggets game.
Cartman: Denver Nuggets game?
William: Yeah, she went with a nice white, Jewish boy.
As Brad sings, Kyle and Nichole look at each other and smile, then look at Brad. Nichole notices someone clear across the center. It's Token, with Craig and Clyde. Token still has a heavy heart, keeping his eyes focused on the floor while Craig and Clyde smile. Kyle looks at Nichole, who's still surprised to see Token there, and grins at her. She looks back at Kyle and smiles. Outside, a tour bus drops Cartman off near the center and Cartman runs for it.: Dialog
Cartman: Nooooooo!
Stacy: Aaahahahaaaa.
Guard: Tickets please.
Cartman: No time! NOOOOOOO!
Randy: BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!
Randy: That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
Dan: Yeah, and that doesn't make a lot of sense, because ever since his concussion in '06, he doesn't even have a license.
Dan: Well, during this time out we're happy to be joined by the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Commissioner, a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the NFL. How's the league handling all that?
Dan: Yeah, not sure if that's meant to be a cake or, or perhaps a, a loaf of bread, but he definitely thinks he's baking something.
Butters: Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
Stan: You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
Butters: That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
Cartman: That's right, Butters.
Dan: And with that the Browns are ready to kick it off back to the Broncos
Randy: All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.
Stan: The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
Randy: Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?
Mr. Mackey: Uh, yes, we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions, m'kay?
Mr. Adler: Bras?
Linda: How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
Randy: Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!
Mr. Mackey: Huh. You you think the students would like that?
Randy: Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!
Mr. Mackey: Hnkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team?
Stan: Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
Butters: I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
Randy: Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.
Randy: How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
Principal Victoria: So you're happy with these changes?
Randy: Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
Anchor: Is football safe for your kids? Concerned Parent Randy Marsh says "No," and has started a movement to reform the sport, gathering followers by the hundreds.
Anchor: Showing just how much one concerned parent can do, Marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of Washington.
Clyde: I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.
Stan: This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
Kyle: We don't even understand how this game is played.
Cartman: That's true.
Clyde, Kenny: Yeah.
Boys: Yeah!
Butters: And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
Randy: Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!
Goodell: Nice going!
Announcer: Welcome to the inaugural game of the National Sarcastaball League! As we bring you today's matchup between the Denver Broncos and the Oakland Raiders.
#24: Give them hell, coach! Lovin', not shovin'!
Announcer: And now, here are your Denver Whoop de fucking do girls!
Cheerleaders: Woo! Woo!
Cheerleader 1: Go Broncos! Go!
Cheerleader 2: Whoop de fuckin' do!
Announcer: And now, here to sing the sarcastaball anthem, recording artist, Cee-Lo!
Fan 1: Woo! Nice job, Cee-Lo! Good to see you on TV some more!
Fan 2: Yeah, I'm a big fan of all your hit songs!
Kyle: Dude, what do you mean "We don't have a coach."?
Stan: Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
Kyle: But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
Kyle: We can't.
Cartman: Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
Butters: Huh?
Craig: Hey yeah.
Butters: Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
Cartman: Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
Butters: Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
Stan: Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
The Team: Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters!
Fangirls: Butters, rah, Butters!
A Fangirl: I love you, Butters!
Stephen: Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night.
Stephen: All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it.
Announcer: The score is zero to zero as the Steelers kick off to the Broncos.
Cheerleader 1: Go Broncos, Go.
Side Judge: Fuck it, it's a fucking field goal!
Reporter 1: Coach, three to nothing victory over the Steelers. You must feel like a reeeal winner.
Randy: Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!
Reporter 2: Guess we'll find out on Sunday.
Randy: All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.
Broncos: D'awwwww!
Manning: Practice on Monday after a victory? Great!
Randy: That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.
Manning: Practice on Monday? That's just what I wanna do!
Cartman: Hey Butters, you got a minute?
Cartman: I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
Butters: Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
Cartman: No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
Butters: Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
Cartman: ...I don't have a dad.
Cartman: Youuu save it all?
Cartman: Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
Cartman: Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
Butters: Do you feel warm and compassionate?
Randy: Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.
Jim Rome: Randy, first off, thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare. Way to go.
Randy: Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.
Sharon: Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?
Randy: Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?
Sharon: Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?
Randy: Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!
Sharon: I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.
Randy: Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!
Sharon: Do you mean that?
Spectators: Awwwwww!
Stan: Cartman, you idiot!
Cartman: That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
Clyde: Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.
Sharon: How do we fix this, doctor?
Doctor: You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain.
Randy: No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.
Doctor: You know, I have a 50-year-old Alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family, but... let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains.
Randy: My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
Doctor: Okay, well I've got a better idea. Let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases, let's, let's take all that money and make commercials that say "Hey America, sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain."
Butters: Like me!
Jim Rome: Get with it, and get the Goo!
Voice-Over: Butters' Creamy Goo is chock full of all the essentials an athlete needs. Commitment! Compassion! And Comradery! And now it's available in quart size!
Singer: Go and chug a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo!
Stan: Dad?
Stan: What?
Sharon: We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore.
Sharon: Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!
Stan: Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
Randy: Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!
Sharon: Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?
Stan: Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!
Randy: Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!
Stan: We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?
Randy: I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
Cartman: That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
Butters: What's sarcasm and what's cum?
Stephen: We'll talk about that when you're older!
Jim Rome: Welcome back to Rome. Some of you might have seen me on TV last night. Turns out the drink I endorsed was semen. Turns out a little kid was just bein' sarcastic. That kid's probably grounded for a month. Check that: I'm sure he's grounded for two months. And a week. Football needs to be made safer, so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen? Yeah, that's a fastball right there. That's a real stroke of philosophic genius! More little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football, and I don't know what else to say but "So long, sarcastaball, it was nice knowin' you." Let's just hope nothin' like this ever happens again. Probably won't. Not for another year. Check that: couple of days.
Butters: My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
Stephen: Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend.
Butters: Thanks, Dad.
Stan: You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?
Kyle: Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
Kyle: Right, you're not fat.
Stan: Whoa duude!
Cartman: See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
Kyle: Why do they even allow those things in stored?
Kyle: You've gotta be kidding me!
Cartman: Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
Kyle: Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
Kyle: You don't need that! Get off of it.
Kyle: What??
Kyle: So take a shit somewhere else!
Ticket Teller: Okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. Anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- Oh...
Legless Boy: I don't have legs.
Anchor: More lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo. Property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms, costing taxpayers millions. Opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of Rascal tipping.
Kyle: You have got to be kidding me!
Kyle: We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
Kyle: So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
Kyle: Who's Honey Boo Boo?
Stan: Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?
Mama: Her favorite foods are sketti and butter, and she likes drinkin' Red Bull and Mountain Dew.
Kyle: Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
Stan: Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
James Cameron: This is it! Throttle down!
Crewman 1: Mr. Cameron, you don't have to do this! Why don't you just go back to your house in Malibu? Go work on another movie?
James Cameron: I have to do this! I have to try and raise it!
Crewman 1: The bar isn't something that actually lowers, Mr. Cameron.
James Cameron: Systems are normal. You guys hearing the song okay up there?
Singers: James (James) Cameron, explorer of the sea
Crewman 1: Yes, James, we hear the song.
James Cameron: Descending to one thousand feet. I don't see the bar yet. Looks like it must have sunk pretty low.
Token: Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.
Kyle: Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
Token: Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.
Kyle: Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?
Kyle: You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.
Token: Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.
Craig: Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth.
Kyle: Fatty Doo Doo?
Kyle: What?
Token's office, nicely appointed. some loud pounding is heard on the door: Dialog
Token: Come in.
Token: I helped you make a documentary, Kyle.
Token: Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.
Kyle: When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
James Cameron: You guys seeing this?!
Crewman 1: Yes, we see, Mr. Cameron.
James Cameron: This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five.
Kyle: I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
Stan: I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
Kyle: Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
Kyle: What?
Stan: Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
Stan: Yeah dude. It's really serious.
Mama: Well, the doctor said Honey Boo Boo needs a heart transplant. They're gonna do a surgery and put a pig heart in her, so, we're going to the ranch to pick out a hog.
Mama: Honey Boo Boo is gonna do pageants with a pig heart, we wanna pick a hog that has pizzazz and knows how to work it, girl!
Honey Boo Boo: I waunt that one!
Honey Boo Boo: I want that one's heart! It looked at me funny!
Honey Boo Boo: What?!
Mama: What you gonna tell them judges if they ask you about your heart?
James Cameron: What the fuck?!
James Cameron: You son of a bitch Newman! How did you beat me down here!
Cartman: It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
Kyle: I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
Kyle: You found a network to buy it?
Token: Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.
Cartman: What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
Token: Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-
Token: That's good, Fatty, get pissed!
Cartman: I'm pissed!
Token: Yeah, Fatty!
Cartman: Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
Cartman: I ain't done with you, bitch!
Man: Yeah! Tip assist!
Crewman 3: I hope so.
Crewman 4: Well I'll be damned.
Mama: I don't know, I... How did I let myself go like this? What have I done??
Man 4: When did we devolve into watching fat kids sketti wrestling?
Token: What the hell is going on?
Kyle: I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
Crewman 5: Hey Cameron, we can't believe it.
Sheila: Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?
Gerald: Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.
Gerald: UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.
Sheila: Oh, dear, but I'm barely dressed.
Sheila: Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!
Sheila: Oh yes!
Sheila: Do it harder, UPS man!
Ike: Yes! Yes!
Kyle: I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
Ike: I saw them, Kyle, I saw them!
Kyle: Oh no...
Kyle: You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
Stan: Dude, what happened?
Kyle: Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
Stan: Whoa!
Cartman: Dude, no way!
Kyle: Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
Stan: Well are you gonna tell your dad?
Kyle: I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
Kyle: What?
Cartman: Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
Stan: Cartman dude, not now.
Cartman: No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
Randy: Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?
Jimbo: How do you tell him? "Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife." It's really none of our business.
Stuart: If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!
Randy: Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?
Security Agent: And so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen, the touch pads at the front and rear doors, and break-in monitors on all windows. I'm afraid those are not secure at all.
Cartman: Oh no, really?
Liane: Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.
Cartman: Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
Liane: Ohhh...
Security Agent: Yes, unfortunately it's not enough to just be fearful of strangers these days.
Cartman: What-what do you mean?
Security Agent: Well, many times, houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows.
Security Agent: We realize that's a lot of money, Mrs. Cartman, but really, how much is feeling secure in your own home worth?
Cartman: Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
Sharon: Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?
UPS Man: Thad.
Randy: Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?
UPS Man: Oh you know, just, tryin' to get to everyone.
Randy: Yeah, w-what are they?
Sharon: You know, to be honest, I can't remember?
Jeff: This is Jeff with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
Cartman: Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
Jeff: That's okay. Do you have your security pass phrase you can tell me?
Jeff: Okay, I've got something a little different here.
Cartman: Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
Jeff: No problem.
Cartman: Sorry about this.
Jeff: It's all right, it happens all the time.
Cartman: 'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean "That's all right"! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
Jeff: You want to rape your mom?
Jeff: You said you lived there.
Mechanic: There's no getting rid of him. Not in any you folks would be prepared for. Noh, best you just let him go on fucking your wives. Maybe he'll get tired of it.
Mechanic: We used a pretty blonde to lure him in. When she answered the door she told the milkman to follow her to the bathrub. She took off her clothes and... asked the milkman to fill the tub with milk. The milkman said, "You want that milk pasteurize?" And the blonde replied, "No, just up to my boobs. I can splash it in my eyes." That's when we jumped 'im. It was over in minutes. Then we burned his body. You wanna get rid of the milkman? You gotta kill him and kill him good. And then you gotta go to the store for your stuff from then on.
Michael: This is Michael with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
Michael: Oh-kay, should we contact the police?
Cartman: Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
Michael: Okay, we're contacting them now.
Cartman: He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
Michael: Try and stay calm, the police are on their way.
Stephen: I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell.
Voice: Well hello there, Mr. UPS man!
UPS Man: What are you-?
Randy: Oh no, pull in here.
UPS Man: Just let me go, huh?
Woman: Oh my God.
Varashnu: ...Uh yes, I am in United States.
Cartman: Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
Cartman: Heh- hello?
Kevin: This is Kevin with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
Cartman: No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
Kevin: We have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute. That takes a lot of employees manning phones.
Cartman: Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
Kevin: Sir, it doesn't matter where we call you from, we still contact the police in your neighborhood.
Cartman: Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
Kevin: I d-I d'uh... Wow, that just fucked my head.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, what are we supposed to do? I mean if Bane is out there on the loose then none of us are safe. One Bane's bad enough, but apparently we got like, like seven Banes? Uhkay?
Gerald: And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
Gerald: What?
Randy: Huh? Nothing.
Randy: Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?
Stranger: Hehey, what cute twins.
Wife: Thanks.
Peter: This is Peter with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
Husband: A white man just tried to murder our twin girls.
Husband: I only hope other have people have INsecurity to protect their families.
Shoe Salesman: Well, how's the shoe fit, pal?
Boy: I think it fits pretty good.
Mom: Hello?
David: This is David with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
Kyle: It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
Stan: You're gonna have to tell him, dude.
Kyle: I know...
Kyle: What?!
Kyle: Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
Kyle: The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
Marcus: This is Marcus with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
Cartman: Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
Marcus: All right, could I just get your password please?
Cartman: Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
Marcus: I love boobs?
Cartman: No, "uloveboobs." Lower-case u love boobs.
Marcus: How did you know that?
Cartman: My password is uloveboobs!
Marcus: Oh oh I get it. That's pretty funny.
Cartman: You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
Randy: And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.
Stuart: Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again.
Stephen: What?!
Stephen: How?
Randy: We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
Mechanic: Milkman don't get scared. Not with free pussy at every doorstep.
Stephen: Son of a bitch, it's him all right!
Randy: This guy doesn't know when to quit!
Mr. Black: Guess this guy's a lot tougher than we thought. Must be why our wives want him so bad.
Alvin: This is Alvin with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
Kyle: Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
Sheila: That's right, Kyle.
UPS Man: Uhh, hi, I got a delivery for ya?
Kyle: Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
UPS Man: What?
UPS Man: What's going on?
Kyle: You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
Brian: This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
UPS Man: No! They blew up my car! They blew up my car!
Brian: I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.
Jimbo: Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!
Martin: Hello, this is Martin with INsecu-
Mike: This is Mike with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
Gerald: Yes, that's mine.
Randy: Yours? What?
Kyle: Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
The Men: Hello?
Randy: It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
Mechanic: Yea'. Got yourselves some nice home security systems, don'tcha? Payin' a man to do your job of protecting your house. Only problem is, while you're out feelin' like your things are safe, that security man is fucking your wife.
Security Agent: Hoo!
Cartman: FELLAS! Fellas!
Stan: What?
Cartman: You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
Cartman: It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
Stan: You're talking about Butters.
Stan: Butters?
Butters: Leave me alone!
Stan: Butters, come out here.
Kyle: Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
Cartman: ...Wow.
Principal Victoria: I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse.
Stephen: Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!
Linda: Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!
Butters: I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
Stephen: Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?!
Stephen: Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua.
Principal Victoria: Eh-excuse me?
Stephen: Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault.
Butters: It's not?!
Butters: Yeah?
Stephen: You probably think Butters seems somehow... different.
Principal Victoria: Ah I'm sorry, I really don't understand.
Stephen: Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing.
Linda: I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!
Stephen: It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do!
Linda: Then we can go with him.
Stephen: You know that's not allowed!
Butters: Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
Stephen: Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa.
Butters: Uhbu-but I'm from here.
Butters: We're from Hawaii?
Butters: But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
Kyle: What?
Cartman: Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
Stan: Hawaii?
Cartman: He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
Kyle: Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
Kyle: Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
Kenny: (Butters, come on.)
Kenny: (Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)
Teller: I already told him, I can't allow anyone on the aircraft who appears to be intoxicated.
Butters: I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua!
Kenny: (Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)
Teller: Tell you what: there's plenty of points on his Mahalo Rewards card. If you wanna fly with him, I can let him go.
Kenny: (Me?)
Butters: Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
Officer: Can I help you with anything?
Butters: Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
Officer: Okay, were you with a cruise ship or land tour group?
Blond Man: Butters Stotch?
Butters: Yeah?
Butters: Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.
Older Woman: Butters, native Hawaiians don't really approve of haoles coming to their ceremonies.
Butters: Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
Butters: You folks are all native Hawaiians too?
Donna: Yes, but Poipu is getting pretty overrun with tourists, I'm afraid.
Butters: What's "saimin"?
Patty: It's one of the foods of our people.
Blond Man: You must stay away from this place. It is kapu.
Chief: Ah, Stephen and Linda's child. Last time I saw you, you were the size of a coconut. Who's the haole?
Kenny: My dearest friends,:I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.
Randy: Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?
Randy: You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
Sharon: I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.
Randy: Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?
Randy: Shelly come on!
Randy: Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.
Sharon: I didn't say anything.
Randy: You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.
Randy: Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.
Randy: Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?
Boy: What's he talkin' about rentin' a divadee?
Randy: Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-
Randy: Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!
Randy: I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!
Butters: Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
Cartman: We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Cartman: Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
Butters: I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
Cartman: Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
Butters: Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
Sharon: I think that's good. Feel tight enough?
Stan: Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.
Sharon: Let's see the shield.
Sharon: Stan's about to go out with his friends.
Sharon: For what?!
Randy: Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!
Shelly: God I hate this family!
Sharon: Randy, let him go trick-or-treating.
Stan: Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
Stan: I know, but there's nothing I can do.
Kyle: But what about the costume contest?!
Kyle: Stan can't come.
Stan: I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
Kyle: Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
Stan: No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
Stan: Oh never mind, I hate him again.
Kyle: Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
Stan: Yeah.
Kyle: Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
Kyle: All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?
Stan: How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
Cartman: This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
Kyle: He looks fine.
Stan: Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.
The Boys: Trick or treat.
Stan: Trick or treat.
Cartman: The Incredible...
Cartman: No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
Man 1: Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green.
Cartman: The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
Man 1: The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?
Kenny: Trick or treat.
Man 2: Ohh wow, it's the Avengers!
Cartman: That's right!
Girlfriend: Oh, it's getting colder out.
Randy: No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.
Randy: He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
Stan: Trick or treat.
Kyle: We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
Stan: What? What's he doing?
Kyle: Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
Stan: Hey, where did you guys go?
Stan: All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
Kenny: Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.
Robber 2: What the? You told me these things were full of money!
Robber 4: Who are you?!
Kyle: Oh my God!
Robber 4: Get 'em!
Robber 1: God damn it those kids saw us! And you let them get away!
Robber 1: All right, who were your friends?
Stan: Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
Robber 2: He's lying. They saw everything!
Stan: No no! We weren't gonna go there!
Boyfriend: Did you have fun at the Halloween party?
Ben: Whaht is what?
Stan: Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
Girlfriend: It's okay. Try and stay calm.
Stan: Oh, ah thank God you found me.
Ben: What is he doing way out here?
Kyle: And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
Sgt. Yates: Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes.
Cartman: Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
Sgt. Yates: Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed?
Officer: Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything.
Stan: They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
Stan: Guys, you're okay!
Kyle: What happened to you?
Stan: It's all right, just a scratch.
Cartman: Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
Sgt. Yates: What?! Are you crazy?! We can't cancel the Monster Mash, it's Halloween Night! It's the Monster Mash's biggest night of the year!
Kyle: Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
Stan: Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.
Sgt. Yates: How many people at the Monster Mash?
Officer 3: Most of the town, sir. It's a graveyard smash.
Officer 4: Look, whatever we do, we'd better hurry. It gets on in a flash.
Sgt. Yates: You boys say you can identify the Red Box thieves?
Kenny: Yes. We saw their faces.
Sgt. Yates: All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise.
Stan: Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
Stan: Oops.
Man 3: Gaaah!
Stan: Hey, be careful in there.
Stan: It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
A Banana: Wow, Gangnamstein. I wish I'd have thought of that.
Mr. Mackey: Hokay everyone, it's time to start the costume contest. m'kay.
Stan: Wait a minute. There they are!
Randy: Who are you people?! You aren't real!
Randy: Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
Boys: AAAAA!
Sgt. Yates: We got the sonofabitch!
Sgt. Yates: Well, I hope you guys have learned that crime doesn't pay.
Robber 1: Not with the convenience of online streaming it don't.
Kyle: Stan?
Stan: Hey dude.
Stan: Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
Kenny: Yeah, Stan?
Sharon: You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?
Randy: Yeah...
Sharon: You want me to bring you some McDonald's?
Randy: Okay...
Sharon: What do you want from McDonald's?
Man: Of course I'm sure!
Kyle: Did you do it?
Cartman: Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
Kenny: (I told you it was a bad idea.)
Randy: Oh I feel like such an idiot.
Stan: It's all right, Dad.
Lead Scientist: Without a doubt there was uh HGH in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. Jesus did not suffer for our sins, he was in fact very high.
Randy: All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
Butters: Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"
Cartman: Uh huh.
Butters: And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."
Stan: All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
Cartman: The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
Butters: Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
Stan: Yeah I know.
Cartman: Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
Craig: Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet.
Stan: Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
Announcer: It's the Charlie Rose show. Here's Chuck.
Charlie Rose: We are here tonight with the only person in America who still wears his "What Would Jesus Do" wristband. Please welcome Stan Marsh.
Charlie Rose: Stan, after everything that's come out, after all the facts have been proven, why do you still wear the wristband?
Charlie Rose: You just like it.
Stan: Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.
Charlie Rose: Well joining us now is just one of the billions of people who think that anyone who still wears their "What Would Jesus Do" wristband is doing all of society a disservice. Chris Martin you say that Stan Marsh is... a dick?
Chris Martin: Yeah, yeah, thanks Charlie. My problem with this kid is he doesn't care about the truth! Okay, if Jesus rose from the dead with the help of drugs, that's fine, but then he went on to say it was a miracle, and that is where it became dangerous! What about the Incas?! What about the Aztecs?! Millions of people who were murdered in Jesus's name, and then Jesus turns out to be a fraud! Wearing that bracelet is a slap in the face to everyone!
Charlie Rose: What do you say about that, Stan?
Charlie Rose: What about the Crusades, Stan? Soes that enter into your decision at all?
Stan: No, I just, I don' know. No.
Charlie Rose: Anything to add, Retarded Fish?
Retarded Fish: Nnno, No, I'm good. Thank you.
Stan: I have?
Mr. Mackey: Yeah. You know, I can't believe in Jesus anymore, 'cause he's a damned fraud, so what I'm gonna believe in is just bein' me, and bein' independent like you. So what I did is I got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground, uhkay? And just believin' in the cause of bein' me.
Stan: You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
Stan: You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?
Stan: ...Farmers in where?
Worker: Move aside, farmers! This land is no longer yours!
Stan: Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
Stan: Wow, this is happening so fast.
Waiter: Would you like to be seated?
Stan: No thanks. I'll stand.
Moviegoer: Hey, you wanna siddown?
Stan: I'm good.
Flight Attendant: Sir, the captain has asked everyone to take their seats.
Lawyer: Mr. Marsh, if you don't mine, we'd like to see your bracelet.
Stan: For what?
Lead Scientist: If you have nothing to hide, then please hand it over, Mr. Marsh.
Kyle: What are you people talking about?
Field Reporter: Are we good? We live? Tom, I'm here at South Park Elementary, where officials have barged their way in after reports of Stan Marsh of the Stanground Foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet. Rumors have surfaced that Stan did not stan his ground as previously stated, and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together.
Lead Scientist: Please let us check your wristband for superglue.
Stan: No! This is stupid!
Butters: He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
Lead Scientist: Are you afraid we might find glue on your bracelet, Mr. Marsh?
Stan: No! I never cut if off!
Lead Scientist: Then, let us ah-see it.
Lead Scientist: I cannot say, but he is a reliable and credible source who is of the utmost prestige.
Butters: Who?
Cartman: Craig?! You asshole!
Stan: What's the big idea, Craig?!
Craig: It just looked like you cut it off, that's all.
Stan: You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
Butters: Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
The Class: Yeah!
Stan: You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
Butters: Go Stan!
Stan: And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
Butters: ...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!
Stan: Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
The Class: Yeah!
Butters: Prostitute!
Announcer: This is breaking news.
Anchor: The tests are done and the results are in. The little boy who claimed he never cut off his "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet did cut it off, and lied about it.
Lead Scientist: Not only did we find traces of ah-superglue, but of yellow magic ah-markeur as well. This is a dark ah-day for honest French-Swedish people everywheure.
Anchor: Though the tests seem conclusive, Stan Marsh continues to deny any cheating.
Kyle: Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
Stan: Thanks Kyle.
Kyle: You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
Stan: Why does it matter?!
Kyle: Because you kind of made it matter.
Stan: You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
Kyle: S-so you did superglue it.
Kyle: Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
Wife: Would you mind getting me some water, darling?
Lead Scientist: Can't you see I'm trying to do ah-my calisthenics?
Wife: But my throat is parched, dear, and I'm so scared of burglars.
Wife: What was that? I could have sworn I saw something outside.
Lead Scientist: It's ah-your imagination
Wife: No, just change to channel 10, thanks.
Wife: What was that?! I think somebody's here!
Stan: Jesus!
Jesus: Shhhh.
Stan: What are you doing here?
Jesus: My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use...
Stan and Jesus: ...to discredit him too.
Lead Scientist: Oh, it's ah-Tweedle Dumb and ah-Tweedle Dee trying to break in-ah-to my house!
Stan: Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
Jesus: Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son.
Stan: Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.
Lead Scientist: Ah-excuse me, I'm sorry to intrude, but do you want to please ah-leave or should I make you some kofel bread and ah-sausages?!
Stan: It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
Jesus: Yeah, I know how it goes.
Stan: Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
Jesus: NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son?
Stan: NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
Jesus: Pff, I know, right?
Stan: Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
Jesus: P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos?
Stan: Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
Jesus: Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again!
Stan: How can we raise awareness?
Jesus: We need to get some bracelets.
P.F. Pityef: Welcome, welcome, to the P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory. How can I be of service?
Stan: Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
P.F. Pityef: Ah, I see you're wearing one of our brown scauses already. Delightful. What color would you like your new scause to be?
Stan: Our... scause?
P.F. Pityef: Well of course! You came for a scause to wear on your paws. And you want others to wear yours upon thaurs.
Jesus: I'm confused.
Stan: Dude, the hell just happen?
Clyde: There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.
Cartman: Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
Cartman: ...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
Butters: Yeeah. Is it true?
Stan: Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
Anchor: It has become the biggest concern for most people. The farmers of Belarus and their plight against their government. And now one person is taking it upon himself to end the crisis. His name? Jesus.
Jesus: These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can.
Field Reporter: Jesus, some people might be thinking you're doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use?
Jesus: You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarrus need my help.
Field Reporter: Ah I believe it's Belarus, Jesus.
Field Reporter: Um, so you think you've something here to keep the conflict from escalating, is that right?
Jesus: I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarrus busting my ass! What are you on?!
Field Reporter: Uh huh, and now that the Belarusian farmers are all dead, what will you try next?
P.F. Pityef: One at a time, please. One at a time.
P.F. Pityef: Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I'll give you two more!
P.F. Pityef: Absolutely! Five dollars please.
Kyle: Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
P.F. Pityef: Oh my, it's the sound!
Butters: Wu-what sound?
Stan: It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
Jesus: Yeah...
Stan: We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
Jesus: Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us.
Stan: Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
Jesus: What can we possibly do?
P.F. Pityef: No please! Please show mercy!
Mr. Mackey: Free Pussy Riot!
Cartman: Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
Denver Poll Worker: Oh dear, did you lose your mother, little boy?
Cartman: MOM!
Denver Poll Worker: Security?
Denver Poll Worker: This little boy lost his mom.
Cartman: She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
Cartman: Mom? Where's my mom?
Charlotte Poll Worker: Oh dear. Did you lose your mommy, little boy?
Cartman: Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
Flight Attendant 2: Warm nuts, sir? Warm nuts?
Cartman: MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
Cartman: MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
Anchor: The people have spoken, and the President of the United States is once again, Barack Obama.
Kyle: Nothing, watching the election results.
Kyle: What?!
Cartman: Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
Kyle: Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!
Cartman: You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
Kyle: It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
Kyle: Sure you do!
Cartman: What if I did, Kyle?
Cartman: Pretty sweet, huh?
Kyle: What the hell is this?
Cartman: What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
Kyle: I don't believe it.
Cartman: No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
Kyle: Why do you have these?
Kyle: Dude!
Kyle: Knock it off, Cartman!
Cartman: Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
Cartman: Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
Agent: Mr. President?
President Obama: Yes?
Agent: Line 2 from China for you, sir. It's General Tso.
General Tso: We assume you are preased with the erection results?
President Obama: Very pleased. Thank you for your help.
General Tso: And you no doubt will now begin filling your side of the bargain.
Agent: Sir, the election may have gone the way they said, but we can't possibly give the Chinese what you promised.
Agent: And what if General Tso suddenly gets the courage to go to the press with all this?
President Obama: Don't worry. Everyone knows General Tso's chicken.
Officer 1: Eric Cartman? We have a report you might be involved in voter fraud?
Officer 2: You mind if we search your room?
Cartman: I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
Kyle: This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
Cartman: Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
Kyle: Upstairs! First door to the left!
Kyle: But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
Cartman: I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
Officer 2: Oh my God, what have we done?
Kyle: Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
Stan: Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.
Kyle: Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
Stan: But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
Kyle: Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
Stan: I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
Jimmy: Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff.
Craig: Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me.
Kyle: God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
Butters: Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.
Butters: Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?
Kyle: Tell us what you know right now!
Stan: Is that an M&M?
Kyle: Then you have to tell us!
Stan: Pry his mouth open!
Craig: He ate it!
Kyle: Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
Waitress: More melted butter, sir?
Cartman: Mm, mhm, mhm.
Cartman: They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
General Tso: Alter our... The President will be here in moments with what we want!
Cartman: Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
President Obama: Thank you, thank you all for your votes of confidence. If I could... just be a little rude and ask for a nice quiet meal in private?
Diner 2: Wow, the President eats at Red Lobster. He's just a normal guy like me.
Doctor: Your friend has had a severe allergic reaction.
Kyle: Can we please just try and talk to him?
Kyle: Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
Butters: Bleh, ogayedmi.
Butters: AGH! No! Please! You can't!
Kyle: Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
Butters: Okay! Okay! He's helping the Chinese get something they want.
Kenny: (At Red Lobster.)
Stan: Huh?
Jimmy: He said "at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red"
Kenny: (Red Lobster!)
Kyle: What?
Jimmy: Ruh Rehh... Red
Kenny: (Red Lobster!)
Stan: Oh, Red Lobster.
President Obama: General Tso, do you have the missing ballots or not?
President Obama: Okay, you want me to come in again, we can start over, what the fuck is this?!
Cartman: Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
General Tso: Morgan Freeman?
Craig: Ohhhh.
Cartman: So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
General Tso: That was not the deal! We will not be a-bullied by you!
Jimmy: Heheh, I get it. General Tso's chih-chih-chicken.
Mike: You are absolutely sure about this?
Kyle: Anything in the basement, Jimmy?
Jimmy: Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos
Kyle: Well keep looking.
Kyle: Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
Liane: Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?
Stan: He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
Jimmy: There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue.
Mickey Mouse: Just what the Dickens is going on here, haha?!
Stan: Aw shit, it's him again.
Mickey Mouse: What's this about a deal with the Chinese?! I own all this shit now! I own the Death Star! I own Tatooine! It's all MINE, haha! All right fuckers, where are the missing ballots? Haha.
Butters: I didn't say anything. I promise.
Butters: Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
Storm Trooper: We found him sir, but still no sign of the missing ballots.
Cartman: Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
Mickey Mouse: Why don't you just tell me where the missing ballots are?! It will make your death a lot less painful! Haha.
Cartman: I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
Cartman: I want a part in the new movies!
Cartman: I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
Mickey Mouse: You can be Luke's son, you can be Han Solo's son, I don't give two shits and a popsicle.
Cartman: Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
Mickey Mouse: Sure thing. I've got tauntauns comin' out my asshole, haha.
Cartman: Haha.
Mickey Mouse: Haha.
Wolf Blitzer: This is Breaking Election News. Hold that phone! The election may be over, but rumors are running rampant that hundreds of thousands of ballots for Mitt Romney were stolen!
Field Reporter: And and you claim that a General Tso hired your friend, Fatass, to steal the ballots, but so far the Chinese are refusing to speak with us.
Field Reporter: Is that it? Did he just? Did he just?
Wolf Blitzer: Yup. Chris, we're getting confirmation that was the millionth time.
Kyle: What?
Field Reporter: Little boy, the General Tso's chicken joke, a favorite for years, you've just hit the magic number, how does it feel?
Stan: Well, we tried, dude.
Kyle: It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
Stan: Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
Kyle: It matters, Stan. It it matters.
Stan: Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?
Stan: Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?
Kyle: Look! There they are!
Mr. Stevenson: Hey, hi there! You kids like Hummers, huh? Let me show you these babies!
Mr. Stevenson: Oh hell yes! Asians! Hey guys!
General Tso: Get out of our way!
Kyle: No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
Officer 2: Oh my God. Are those what I think they are?
Cartman: Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
Officer 3: Sir, we've found something, at the Hummer sales lot outside of town.
General Tso: You don't understand. We are trying to protect the greatest film series ever made!
Kyle: Protect it?
Officer 4: What the hell is going on here?!
Officer 5: Is that Morgan Freeman?
Officer 1: Well kid?
Kyle: Well... if you put it that way...
An Officer: Come in Unite 4! What have you found?!
Lawrence: How many hours were you guys playing?
Cartman: Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like "Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"
Kyle: AAAARGH!
Lawrence: You were playing football?
Cartman: Yeah, but I was like "I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle." In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
Kyle: That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
Kyle: Then take that shit off speaker phone!!
Lawrence: Is that that same kid?
Cartman: Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
Kyle: How do we have a choice?!
Cartman: Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
Lawrence: Yeah yeah, you said that.
Toby: My dad says the government keeps a database on everyone.
Cartman: Who is that? Is that Toby
Toby: Yeah.
Cartman: Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
Toby: Yeah, we're ditching school.
Cartman: You're what? What, you say?
Lawrence: Me and Toby are ditching school!
Lawrence: I don't think so.
Lawrence: That'd be cool.
Cartman: That'd be what?
Lawrence: That'd be COOL.
Cartman: Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?
Lawrence: I said I got your tweet and the address!
Cartman: Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
Toby: Yeah, I'm here, bro.
Butters: Ww-ww-what's the N S A?
Butters: The government watches everything we do?
Cartman: Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
Lawrence: They're spying on you?
Lawrence: Like what?
Cartman: Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
Lawrence: Naw, don't do that.
Lawrence: You need that new thing where you don't need to type.
Cartman: What, they already have something better than Twitter?
Lawrence: You haven't seen the Alec Baldwin commercial?
Cartman: No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
Cartman: ["Alright, what's up everybody, what's up? I'm about ready to go to the NSA undercover, and see if I can expose some of those secrets." When Cartman appears, Kyle stops. "You can follow me on my Shitter account at #keepyourgovernmentoutofmybusinessdotcom. Wait, sh, I've gotta be careful. Kyle is here and I'm pretty sure he's tryin' to listen in."]
Cartman: [walks up to Kyle. "Kyle, if you wouldn't mind, this broadcast is for my Shitter followers only." Clyde and Stan join them]
Clyde: What's Shitter?
Cartman: [leans towards Clyde. "Don't know if you've heard, but the government is actually able to monitor all our e-mails and Twitter accounts." leans towards Clyde. "With Shitter I don't even need a cell phone. My thoughts are sent directly to the Internet, and then to everyone else on Shitter."]
Stan: Wow.
Cartman: [leans towards Stan. "Yes. Now as I infiltrate the NSA, I'll be able to broadcast everything to all my Shitter followers."]
Kyle: You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
Cartman: Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.
Cartman: Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
Alec Baldwin: ["I'm about to sit down and eat a sandwich at this amazing deli run by two faggtots in Chelsea."]
Cartman: ["Oh cute. I'll have to try it out sometime, lol."]
Alec Baldwin: ["In 1982 I was at a party at Mike Douglas' house and I fucked Kim Basinger."]
Cartman: ["Wow, that's kewl. She's cute.;) emoji"]
Butters: Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice?
Man: DMV people? They're the meanest people on planet Earth.
Clerk: Why not a thousand "Livin' In America"s?
Receptionist: Can I help you sir?
Cartman: Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
Receptionist: All right, and your name?
Cartman: Bill Clinton.
Cartman: Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
Alec Baldwin: ["If you're ever in Los Angeles, be sure to look up Jennifer Love Hewitt. She can make a pussy sandwich that will give those faggots in Chelsea a run for their money"]
Chief: What have you got, Patricia?
Patricia: Uh, this man says he has an interview for a job, sir?
Cartman: I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
Alec Baldwin: ["I borrowed my brother's dick once to fuck Darryl Hannah."]
Chief: That's quite alright. The NSA needs all the help it can get. Come on upstairs and I'll show you around, see if you're fit for the job.
Butters: Sure, I love the Truth.
Pamphleteer: Okay, we from uh Jehovah Witness. We Kingdom Hall Jehovah Witness, and uh, we believe, sir, that uh many people interpret the Bible it wrong.
Butters: Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.
Pamphleteer: We are, sir. We believe the, the Truth. I was once like you. I knew not what to believe, then I let my pulvy the Jehovah into the heart.
Butters: Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
Pamphleteer: Yes, because uh Jehovah will bring judgement against all who perish like the little girl will burn in fire.
Butters: Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
Pamphleteer: The government ih watching me?
Colleague: Wansa?
Colleague: Hi now?
Pamphleteer: How long they been watching us?
Butters: Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
Chief: Right this way, Bill. Welcome to the NSA main office.
Cartman: Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
Detective: Hey Joe?
Joe: Whatchoo got, Miller.
Miller: Got a 24-year-old male in Albuquerque. He just e-mailed his wife and asked if she could go to the store after work. Then he called the fitness center to set up a membership. He liked the fitness center, so he tweeted his friends that they should try it out.
Miller: Will do.
Larson: Got a seventeen-year-old female down in Jacksonville. She called her friend and asked her if she wanted to see the Percy Jackson movie. Then she e-mailed her mom at work and asked if it was okay. The mom said yes, but called her husband first to make sure there weren't any dinner plans.
Joe: Alright, keep an eye on all three of them.
Joe: If you think you got the stomach for this, then we can definitely use your help, young man.
Detective: Sir, you might wanna check this out.
Joe: What have you got?
Cartman: ["Four sixteen pm. The chief asked me to join him as he went to question the possible suspects. I agreed to go along. Hopefully, the NSA has no idea of my secret intentions." The chief looks at him. "lol." The chief focuses on the road again. Moments later they stop in front of a house and get out of the car. The chief knocks on the door and a hippie answers it.]
Hippie: Well well, the NSA. I should've known.
Joe: We wanna talk to you about some tweets you've been tweeting.
Hippie: Hey man, I was just blowin' smoke. Say, what right does the government have reading my private e-mails anyway?! Haven't you squares heard of the Constitution?
Hippie: Yeah? What's that?
Hippie: ...I never thought of it that way.
Alec Baldwin: ["I fucked Jack Lemmon's makeup girl in a Port-A-Potty. Woops." The chief notices the lights on Cartman's Shitter device but doesn't say anything.]
Butters: Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
Craig: ...The truth about what?
Butters: We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
Craig: ...Aahhhh, no, I don't think so.
Pamphleteer: My colleague and I, we went to saaah experience at DMV. We went to DMV, we admit all our shortcomings an sins and uh make a tital wave of peace and serenity with the truth stored inside our heart.
Butters: You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
Craig: Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no.
Butters: Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
Craig: I have no idea.
Cartman: ["I've done it. I've infiltrated the NSA, and gained their trust." A shot of Alec Baldwin and his date at a buffet restaurant. The camera pans across until it reaches the couple. "So far, I've not ascertained how they were able to keep track of everyone in the country, but I'm close. Very close. I just hope that I'm not found out as a whistleblower before I'm able to expose their entire operation."]
Date: What is that voice?
Alec Baldwin: Some little faggot in my head.
Cartman: Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
Detective 3: Pretty simple. Everyone has a file. People who have a status of "threat", "possible threat", or "person of interest" are the ones we really wanna look at.
Detective 4: The more we pay attention to them, the bigger their file becomes.
Cartman: Really? How big is my file?
Detective 4: Huh?
Cartman: Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
Detective 3: Jarvis, what have we got on an "Eric Cartman"? Any files on Eric Cartman.
Jarvis: Ohhh yeah, we tracked him for a little bit, but Central Computer designated his status as "fat and unimportant."
Butters: Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?
Barbrady: I, I feel really good.
Clerk 3: Uh people keep showing up and telling us what they did wrong.
Cartman: Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
Chief Joe: Not according to the Central Computer.
Cartman: The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
Cartman: I don't know.
Chief Joe: Alright, I'll show you. But this is very top security stuff, because if people knew how we did it, then everyone would do it. Then our enemies would do it. We can't let our enemies get their hands on this.
Alec Baldwin: Hi everybody, and welcome to my new show on MSNBC, "Free Pass with Alec Baldwin"
Cartman: ["Your secret is out, NSA! And now that everyone knows what you're doing to Santa you can kiss your program goodbye!"]
Cartman: You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
Liane: Eric, honey, what's the matter?
Liane: I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.
Liane: Honey, it's okay.
Liane: No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.
Cartman: I do toooo!
Liane: No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?
Liane: Okay, hon.
Butters: Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
Cartman: ...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?
Butters: It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
Cartman: What's this?
Butters: Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
Cartman: I can be forgiven?
Butters: Yes.
Cartman: For everything bad I've ever done?
Butters: Yes!
Cartman: And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
Butters: That's right.
Butters: We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
Cartman: I do, I love my country!
Butters: Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
Cartman: I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
Butters: Hallelujah!
Group: Yaaaaay!
Paul: Do you want us to kick them out of here, Lar?
Cartman: Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.
Wendy: Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!
Cartman: I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
Butters: Murder porn?
Cartman: That's more like it.
Stan: You guys are watchin' murder porn?
Randy: ...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
Sharon: Uh adults like documentaries.
Randy: Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.
Randy: Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
Stan: What's up dude?
Cartman: Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?
Stan: Yhh, yeah, the first grader?
Cartman: You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
Stan: ...What?!
Stan: What happened?
Kyle: Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
Red: How is this stuff allowed to stay on the air?!
Clyde: The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
Wendy: This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
Cartman: Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
Sharon: Is the lube over there?
Randy: Yeah, I got lube right here.
Sharon: Well get over here, big guy.
Randy: What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
Stephen: Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!
Mrs. Tweak: How are they able to do this with their smartphones?
Stuart: No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.
Randy: Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!
Cable Guy: As we told the others, sir, we can fix it. We just need to send a technician out to your house to change out your cable box.
Randy: NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!
Randy: I can't afford DirecTV.
Stephen: Well? Any luck?
Randy: No, just the usual cable-company stuff.
Mrs. Tweak: Oh well, guess we'll just have to live without our informative crime drama.
Stephen: No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?
Randy: I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.
Stephen: We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price.
Boy: Hello?
Randy: Hi. Corey Lanskin?
Corey: Yes?
Randy: We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
Corey: You was told wrong, mistuh! I'm just a simple kid with a simple passion for simple things!
Gerald: Punching trees?
Randy: Why, why would we punch trees?
Corey: NOO NOO, in this Minecraft forest, how do you get wood?!
Randy: Puh, punching trees?
Corey: Riiight. You punch the trees to get the wood, you get the wood to build a cabin.
Randy: Oh, I see. So when does the game start?
Randy: ...I don't get it.
Corey: That's because you're thinkin' like a dad. Minecraft, it don't got no winner. It don't got no objective. You just fuckin' build an' shit. And seein' if other things can come and knock it down. Now, let's click on the inventory, and let's filter through the skin!
Randy: Yes ah, I'm getting it now.
Gerald: You are?
Randy: No.
Sharon: Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.
Sharon: I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
Randy: Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.
Sharon: We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
Randy: Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.
Kyle: What? How do you know?
Tweek: I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!
Craig: It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
Stan: That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
Stan: What?
Stan: Butters, what happened?
Kyle: Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?
Mr. Mackey: Butters, your dad threw you down a well?
Stan: In Minecraft.
Mr. Mackey: Well what the hell is that?
Butters: I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
Stan: Whattaya mean?
Randy: Yes?
Officer 1: Hello sir, had a little incident last night, wondering if you saw or heard anything?
Randy: No, what happened?
Officer 1: Well, someone broke into your next door neighbor's back yard and they... dug up a bunch of holes and punched his trees.
Randy: Punched his trees, huh?
Officer 1: Yes sir. Then we got a house across the street where someone dug up the yard and... built a cabin.
Officer 1: What were you doing last night?
Randy: I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
Officer 2: I play the banjo too.
Officer 1: Well, thanks for your time sir. You might wanna keep the lights on in your yard tonight in case someone tries to build a cabin on it as well.
Kyle: Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
Craig: I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!
Clyd: Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
Kyle: You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
Cartman: And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
Wendy: I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
Cartman: Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.
Butters: Huh?
Stephen: Aw, go to hell, you griefer!
Cartman: Alright, we've gotta do something.
Kyle: Corey Lanskin?
Corey: Eh yes?
Kyle: We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
Stan: Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
Corey: Oh no, please don't be angry. My mommy's always angry. "Get back in the meat locker!" "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!" But she loves me, right? Mommy loves me?
Kyle: Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
Stan: What, dude?
Cartman: Something he said. Did you hear him? He said "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"
Stan: So?
Cartman: You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
Kenny: (I knew you're up to something!)
Corey: Kids gotta find some way to make a livin', don't 'e?
Stan: You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
Corey: What? You mean like Investigation Discovery?
Kyle: So you know it.
Kyle: We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
Cable Guy: Hey guys, can I help you?
Kyle: Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.
Stan: Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
Kyle: Can we talk to your supervisor please?!
Cable Guy: Oh, sure. Hey David?
Stan: We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
Kyle: You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
David: Hey Mitch? When can you get out to shut off some cable boxes?
Stan: No, that's way too long!
Cable Guy: Oh it is?
David: Oh Jeez, that's terrible.
David: Say... say that last part again?
Stan: What?
David: Well what was the last part you said?
Stan: I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
David: Nono, the part about your parents not getting the channels easily?
Stan: I... said it would really bum them out.
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by for an important message from the president of your local cable company.
Randy: Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
Stan: Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
Sharon: No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.
Randy: Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?
Sharon: I'm here, Randy.
Randy: Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
Sharon: I've got a surprise for you too, Randy.
Sharon: Sorry. I couldn't resist.
Randy: Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!
Sharon: Oh I did! That felt really great.
Randy: Felt great?
Randy: That felt so good!
Sharon: My turn again.
Randy: Okay, hang on.
Sharon: I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?
Randy: Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now.
Sharon: Oh I love you, Randy.
Token: Nothing.
Token: Yeah.
Jimmy: Uh, I'm just gettin' ready for cla-
Stan: Is he doing it again?
Kyle: He's doing it a-gain.
Token: I uhhh, have band practice.
Stan: Cartman, are you feeling alright?
Mr. Mackey: Eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open.
Cartman: It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
Mr. Mackey: And why do you think Token is a tickin' time bomb?
Cartman: He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
Mr. Mackey: Do you think he blames you for somethin'?
Cartman: But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
Mr. Mackey: Wull have you, thought about maybe writin' your feelin's down? In a poem? Uh- write a poem and give that to, g-give that to Token?
Cartman: No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
Mr. Mackey: Well Eric, you need to do somethin' because you keep losing sleep. M'kay and sleep is very important to your success at school. M'kay?
Cartman: M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, you sure? Because I'm here when you need me.
Cartman: M'kay.
Cartman: No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!
Rachel: Where's Daddy?
Rachel: Daddy!
Karin: How did I get such a perfect husband?
Gerry: How did I get such a beautiful wife?
Rachel: I love you, Dad.
Gerry: I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally.
Karin: Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other.
Reporter: Today apparently will be the day! CNN has just received word that a verdict in the George Zimmerman trial is expected to come at any moment! Zimmerman is accused of shooting Trayvon Martin, and a jury will now decide his fate.
Constance: Daddy, who is Trayvon Martin?
Gerry: Is it bigger than a bread box?
Rachel: What's a bread box, Dad?
Constance: Heehee, Dad is so kewl.
Karin: You can say that again.
Reporter: We interrupt this cool song for a news bulletin. A verdict has just been handed down in the case of George Zimmerman. In a shocking turn of events, the jury has found George Zimmerman not guilty!
Gerry: AAAAAH!
Protester: Fuck you, Brad Pitt!
Token: Fuck you, Brad Pitt!
Cartman: Hey Token? How are you doing?
Token: I'm good.
Cartman: No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!
Token: Okay, really?
Mr. Mackey: Now Eric, whatever it is you and Token are going through, you need to talk through it, m'kay? The problems you two are havin' have become a distraction for everybody else. Agreed?
Cartman: Agreed.
Cartman: Hoh boy, here we go.
Mr. Mackey: Token, I've been talkin' with Eric and he's really upset that you two aren't gettin' along. You have some things you wanna say, Eric?
Token: ...What jury?
Cartman: This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
Mr. Mackey: Okay Token, what are your feelings about that?
Token: This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.
Token: Can I go back to class now?
Mr. Mackey: Eric, do you feel better about all this?
Cartman: Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
Cartman: It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
Cheerleaders: We are Cows, proud and true! Come on, South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows!
Cartman: Token, calm down.
Token: What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!
Woman: Does that little boy have a gun?
Woman: But-
Nelly's Mom: What's going on?!
Cartman: Get to an airport!
Nelly's Mom: An airport?! But...?
Announcer: Now calling rows 10 through 30 for boarding.
Passenger 2: Which one?
Pilot: My God, what's going on out there?
Copilot: Maybe now you can tell us what the hell is going on?!
Cartman: The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
Captain: Alright what the hell is going on here?!
Worker 1: We don't know anything. First there was talk of a hijacking, then reports of an outbreak of some kind.
Worker 2: Confirmed report of panic in a rural town in the Colorado Rockies!
Worker 3: Sir, the pilot of flight 82 wants an update. They're asking permission to land.
Captain: Stall them. I don't want that plane landing anywhere until we know what the hell we're dealing with!
Captain: Survival of what?
Captain: Oh my God.
Copilot: Do you think it's a virus?
Pilot: Virus, bacteria, either way we're all dead! Find out if he thinks it's safe to land in Los Angeles.
Copilot: What about Los Angeles? Can we take the plane to Los Angeles?
Copilot: This plane won't make it to Iceland!
Passenger 3: You got a better idea, asshole?!
Cartman: Everyone quiet! I have to think!
Nelly's Mom: Yes, let him think!
Occupant: Oh, I'm just finishing up.
Occupant: Hey!
Nelly's Mom: What?!
Passenger 3: What do you mean?!
Butters: Yes.
Mr. Mackey: Now, Token, what you need to understand, m'kay, is that a school assembly is not the time and the place to be yellin' and causin' distractions. M'kay? If there's somebody causin' you problems, then we don't disrupt the assembly, m'kay. You come and you talk to me.
Token: He's just out looking for trouble.
Cartman: Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
Cartman: It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
Pilot: Then you have to stop it.
Nelly's Mom: Yes!
Pilot: And there must be... a Patient Zero... The person it all starts from.
Cartman: His name is Token.
Nelly's Mom: We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!
Cartman: I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
Nelly's Mom: Oh my God! Oh my God!
Cartman: We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
Nelly's Mom: Yes!
Reporter: First, a wave of 911 calls about a virus, and now a plane has apparently gone down in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Is this the beginning of the end?
Butters: Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!
Mrs. Biggle: Oh, but remember, Daddy wanted to talk to you in the living room, my dark little princess.
Henrietta: Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!
Mrs. Biggle: We'll be waiting in the living room.
Henrietta: What?!
Mrs. Biggle: Oh, a little family chit-chaaat.
Henrietta: Shut up, Mom!
Mr. Biggle: Henrietta, as you know, your mother and I have been concerned about your behavior for some time.
Henrietta: Are we really doing this again?!
Mr. Biggle: We've had a hard time coping with the dark things you're into, but we've finally had some counseling, and apparently we're not the only parents who have a child that is... emo.
Henrietta: What?!
Henrietta: I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!
Mr. Biggle: Do you know how your foul language breaks your mother's heart?
Mrs. Biggle: Like calling Mommy Demon Jizz.
Henrietta: Noo...
Mr. Biggle: A camp which is for troubled kids like you, and you get to work outside and learn about responsibility.
Mr. Biggle: It's for two weeks, and when you come back we can talk about earning back some of your privileges.
Henrietta: I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!
Mrs. Biggle: Theeeey have a horseshoe pit where you can challenge the other kids to horsehoooes.
Pete: And that's all you know? what else did she say?
Michael: She said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks.
Firkle: Is she at the camp now?
Firkle: That's fucking creepy man.
Worker: Alright now, you say that you witnessed your friend being abused by her parents.
Michael: Yes. They called her an emo.
Worker: What's wrong with that?
Michael: Emos suck! Their vile, self-pitying, depressed assholes!
Worker: So, why do you think they called her that?
Michael: Because she's Goth, and some ignorant people don't know the difference!
Pete: Oh my God! They're totally different!
Worker: Okay, different how?
Firkle: Emos suck my Goth balls.
Worker: That's not much of a difference.
Pete: That's a huge fucking difference!
Michael: Okay okay, look, emos are more prone to suicide.
Pete: This fuckin' bitch, man.
Pete: Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.
Pete: No, see, you're nihilistic.
Michael: Oh yeah, you're right.
Pete: What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?
Pete: What the hell have they done to you?
Emo Boy: God, PE class is for such wannabe posers.
Emo Girl: I'd rather kill myself than put on gym shorts.
Pete: Uugh, how could she hang out with them??
Michael: There must something else going on here.
Henrietta: Not now Mom! I'm suicidal!
Michael: What did they do you you? At that camp?
Henrietta: What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.
Michael: Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that place turned you into an emo.
Henrietta: That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?
Michael: What?!
Michael: Nooo waaaaay.
Henrietta: Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.
Michael: Omigodnowaaaaaaaaay.
A ring tone: Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and desp-
Michael: It's worse thann we thought.
Michael: No! I mean Henrietta. I confronted her and she was all like "I am emo! And emos are going to rule the world" and I was like "No waaay!" and she was like "Yeah, soon it will be too late." and I was all "No waaay!"
Pete: No way.
Michael: Can't now, Mom! I've got an emergency!
Michael: What??
Michael: What the hell are you talking about?!
Pete: I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.
Firkle: Pete... if they get me... if I get sent to that camp... and I come back Emo... kill me. Promise that you'll kill me.
Pete: Not now, lady, we're really depressed.
Waitress: So what else is new?
Firkle: Are you crazy?
Firkle: The Vampires are our sworn enemy. We beat up their leader, and burned down their lair. Don't you remember?
Pete: Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help.
Vamps: Hail Mike.
Firkle: Sorry.
Pete: But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem.
Mike: You've got a lot of nerve coming here!
Pete: Uhhhhh, right.
Henrietta: Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?
Emo Girl: I can't. I'm too depressed. I keep cutting myself.
Mr. Biggle: Does she still seem better?
Mrs. Biggle: Oh, much better! She didn't call me a bitch, and she actually apologized to me.
Mr. Biggle: Well that's more like it.
Mike: And you say she just showed up like this?
Pete: You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!
Cowlick Vamp: That blonde Emo is Sarah Collins. She was a Vamp kid two weeks ago.
Black Vamp: You want me to go in there and waste these mothafuckas?! I'll do it!
Pete: We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.
Mike: Indeed. If there is some kind of black magic at work creating these monsters, then we will have to use our most powerful Vampiric abilities to stop it.
Cowlick Vamp: Do you mean?
Mike: Yes, my child of darkness. We must call upon the powers of the Vamp kids' most sacred entity, per se. Only he can help us in this darkest time. This calls... for a summoning.
Pete: This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!
Mike: Edgar Allan Poe was the original Vamp kid.
Pete: No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!
Black Vamp: Ey, look man! All genres of Gothic subcultures are derivatives of Poe's work. Muthafucka!
Poe: Where am I? What is this place?
Firkle: It's him! It's Edgar Allan Poe.
Pete: Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos.
Poe: Emos? ...Ew-oh my God, Emos are such wannabe conformists.
Mike: Yeah, oh yes!
Pete: Right!
Poe: Children of Darkness, I would help you, but I fear I cannot be seen with a bunch of douchey Vamp kids and their poser-ass plastic fangs.
Pete: Thank you!
Mike: Hey!
Pete: I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.
Poe: Agrees with who? Is that red dye in your hair or did a blood demon take a shit on your head, poser?
Black Vamp: Ah ah! He got you there, nigga!
Pete: Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.
Poe: Why should I? Just 'cause you summoned me doesn't mean you're the boss of me!
Pete: Uh, yeah, it kind of does.
Michael: What the hell are you doing to people?!
Gardener: Not me. I just work for them. They're not evil, you know? They're just misunderstood. All I do is help the Emos get into their human hosts. They promised me when they take over Earth I can have a cabin on the lake, and all the steak I can eat.
Gardener: It's quicker if you don't fight it.
Pete: Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.
Poe: You can't tell me what to do! Who elected you the mayor of me?!
Pete: Cut it out, Edgar! It's annoying everybody!
Black Vamp: Well that's your name, isn't it?
Poe: That's the name my stupid parents gave me! I like to be called by my Goth name: NightPain
Black Vamp, Mike, and Pete: Oh God...
Poe: What? You guys are posers!
Black Vamp: Ey, just so you all know, if one of you ain't who you say they is, and we get inside that base and you reveal you're actually one of them Emo muthafuckas in disguise, I WILL go crazy on yo' ass!
Poe: If one of us is a traitor, it's probably your wannabe vampire leader.
Mike: Oh, fuck off, NightPain.
Poe: Make me, poser.
Pete: Michael?! You here?
Pete: Dude! Michael, are you okay?
Firkle: I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that's not the plan.
Pete: Ugh! Let us go, you ultimate conformists!
Mike: Oh God! I'm starting to feel Emo.
Pete: Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?
Mike: He said he was over this, and was gonna hang out at the Village Inn.
Pete: What?!
Poe: Leave me alone! I just want coffeh.
Poe: Bitch.
Poe: I can't right now. I'm dealing with a lot and I just have a lot of anxiety.
Poe: What's the point? Save some people so some other people can be lame? And then those lame-os can be lamer to some other posers?
Gardener: Just let the spores inside you. Stop fighting it.
Mike: Wait. Look!
Poe: What do you want me to do?
Mike, Michael, and Pete: Shoot it!
Poe: Really? Shoot a plant?
Gardener: Lowe's Home and Garden?
Gardener: No they, they talk to me.
Poe: No, they're just, like, ficus plants and vibrating pots.
Gardener: But-
Voice: Looks like it's over, Harold Flannagan. So we have just one question for you: are you scared?!
Voice: ARE YOU SCARED?!
Host: Look! Look at the camera right there
Host: Your wife Sarah put you up to this.
Firkle: This is a prank?
Black Vamp: Oh man that's good! They got us good!
Firkle: I turned traitor for no reason?
Michael: I have no idea what's going on.
Host: Howard, did you suspect at all that a gardener job at a camp for troubled teens was a setup?
Flannagan: No, they really had me convinced!
Host: And you didn't suspect anything when we had plants tell you to turn Goths and Vamp kids into Emos when really they're exactly the same thing?
Host: Tune in again next week, when we make a woman from Milwaukee think she's working at a haunted abortion clinic.
Henrietta: So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?
Michael: It was all a prank by some douchey network reality show.
Henrietta: Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.
Michael: No, you just kind of did it on your own.
Henrietta: Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!
Cartman: That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
Kyle: Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
Sheila: Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.
Kyle: I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
Kyle: Hey Ike, how's it going?
Kyle: I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
Kyle: Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
Ike: Then stop harassing me, bro! You don't know what it's like to be a baby goin' through puberty! I don't know whether to watch Yo Gabba Gabba or go out and tame some strange!
Kyle: Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
Ike: Dancy Dance is my favorite.
Kyle: What?
Kyle: Ike, is that chewing tobacco?
Ike: What?! You gonna fuckin' narc and tell Mom?!
Kyle: No, I just don't think it's healthy.
Mr. Mackey: Come in, m'kay.
Mr. Mackey: Oh-kay, have you set up a counseling appointment on IntelliLink?
Kyle: It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
Mr. Mackey: Okay, I'll click on family issues. What time did you want counseling?
Kyle: Right now.
Mr. Mackey: Oo-kay, aaand, what is your brother's Intelligrated smart name?
Kyle: I don't know.
Kyle: What?
Mr. Mackey: Sorry, Kyle, we're gonna need to maybe go somewhere else. Uh... find an IntelliLink panel somewhere.
Mr. Mackey: Well it sounds like he's hittin' puberty.
Kyle: Yeah, he just seems so young.
Ike: This is stupid, bro! I already know all this!
Kyle: Let's just give it a chance, Ike.
Minister: Make me look like an idiot, will you?!
Minister: Ey! You told me you queefed on my face because because that's how babies are born!
Wife: I was being sarcastic.
Minister: Being sarcastic?! I just told a million Canadian teenages that's how it's done!
Wife: I was angry because you never listen to me. Because I wanted you to go with me to therapy and you never go.
Minister: Fine! You want me to go with you to therapy?! Fine!
Minister: Totally embarrassing and degrading! She queefed right in my face!
Therapist: Well, maybe you should spend less time at work making public health films and more time at home.
Kyle: What the fuck is going on?!
Kyle: I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
Stan: He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
Kyle: He doesn't even let me near him!
Cartman: That sucks, dude.
Kyle: What??
Cartman: I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
Mr. Mackey: Okay, there we go. That's cut the speakers off. Now what was it you were trying to do, Kyle?
Mr. Garrison: Mr. Mackey, can he just go talk to the principal?
Mr. Mackey: Yes!
Cody: My name's Cody. I'm your smartnician. You're havin' some intelliproblems with your astutelinks?
Mr. Mackey: Yeah, a student is trying to make an appointment to see the principal. M'kay?
Mr. Mackey: Oh I see.
Cody: If you wanna have those intelligrated with EasyLink, you might wanna upgrade your system to the silver package.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, I I needed the silver package? Okay okay? Can we do that?
Kyle: Hey Ike.
Ike: Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm playing trucks!
Kyle: Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
Ike: You promised!
Kyle: I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
Ike: Well what am I supposed to do?! See it myself?! I'm a little baby! Who's gonna hold my fuckin' hand?! You don't give a shit about how I feel!
Kyle: Ike, I do! I just-
Plex: Hey Muno, what should we do now?
Muno: Let's play Cool Cool Trick.
Ryan: My name is Ryan!
Plex: And what is your cool cool trick, Ryan?
Plex: And what's your name, little boy?
Ike: Ike Broflovski.
Plex: Do you have a cool trick?
Ike: Yeah, for my cool cool trick I'm gonna tame Foofa's strange.
Plex: Tame mo what?
Ike: I can tame Foofa's strange, bro.
Toodee: No, that's wrong!
Plex: Don't do it.
Brobee: Uh uh.
Kyle: We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
Muno: A little young for that, isn't he?
Kyle: That's what I thought.
Foofa: He's right, Plex. We're getting older. I don't wanna do the little kid thing the rest of my life.
Brobee: Foofa, what are you talking about?
Foofa: It's time for us to start playing to older people. Maybe we need to be edgier. Have a little sex appeal.
Toodee: Foofa, no!
Plex: Oh God. What has this little boy done??
Minister: I try not to think about it, Rick. I try to just forget aboot it and then move on, but I can't. I mean... she queefed right in my face!
Rick: Have you and your wife seen a therapist together?
Minister: Yes, we went but... I just can't erase the memory of my helpless face being queefed on like that. Who's to say she won't do it again?
Rick: Don't you think this has something to do with your new job?
Minister: What do you mean?
Rick: There's more to this, Terry. A lady never queefs in her lord's face without some major cause. You started as the Canadian Minister of Health and three months later your wife queefed in your face. There's a connection.
Terry: I took the job to try and make Canada's health care system better. What could that have to do with my wife?
Rick: Terry, I'm your friend. And I'm not just your friend, I'm also your boddy
Terry: Thanks, guy.
Mr. Mackey: Well yeah, but see, the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet.
Mr. Adler: They can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off!
Pat: Hello everyone.
Pat: Oh. Well, I'm just sort of getting acclimated to the situation and I-
Principal Victoria: Oh noo!
Mr. Mackey: No, see, it's a $10,000 upgrade, but it should clean up all of Pat's mistakes.
Coach: Mr. Mackey, let's be clear. IntelliLink was your idea. You should admit it was a bad one and stop being so defensive.
Mr. Mackey: Well ih it's good to be a little defensive around you, Miles, m'kay. Let's, let's not forget that your wife died of an "accident" while you were "drinking" on a "hike," "N'kay!"
Miles: Hey now listen here-!
Anchor: The video awards are at 8 pm tomorrow.
Foofa: Oh this is so exciting!
Ike: Told you it'd go over well.
Ike: Shut up, Kyle! Just ignore my little brother.
Plex: Can I talk to you?
Kyle: I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling-
Brobee: Thank you, dude.
Muno: Oh thank God.
Toodee: Heey.
Kyle: Hey!
Plex: Foofa, what is this about you going on the MTV Video Awards?
Foofa: I'm done being a kiddie star!
Plex: Foofa, you don't have to show your strange to get attention.
Ike: You just don't get it 'cause you're a robot, Plex.
Sinad: Don't do it, Foofa, Don't sell out your strange to those corporate bastards.
Ike: Awww, screw off, Sinad O'Connor. No one gives a crap about you.
Plex: Don't show your strange on TV.
Troupe: Don't show your strange.
Plex: Your strange is for your husband, not for all the world to see.
Troupe: Don't show your strange on TV
Sinad: I'm looking for a boyfriend. Looking for a boyfriend.
Kyle: What?
Kyle: No, this is his brother.
Terry: Your brother receives his medication from us, so we just wanna be sure he's satisfied with the service.
Terry: Before this meeting continues, I should have you be aware that my face has tested positive for queefie sores.
Terry: People all over the world get their medication from Canada.
Kyle: Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
Kyle: You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
Kyle: Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
Terry: Yes, that's right.
Kyle: That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
Kyle: Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
Announcer: Tom Brady looking sluggish again today. Not sure what his problem has been lately.
Tom Brady: Blue 28! ... Blue 28!
Commentator: Yeah, definitely not looking as strong and virile as he has in the past, Tom.
Mr. Mackey: No, they have to be able to get grades!
Cody: Well, what you prbably wanna do is upgrade to IntelliLink Platinum.
Cody: ...What exactly do you mean by "work"?
Mr. Mackey: I just want students to be able to make appointments to see the counselor, be able to see the school norse in the easiest, most streamlined fashion!
Cody: Oh, you want the Centurion package. That's where we take all the IntelliLink panels and we rip them off the walls and we burn them. Then we wipe all the computers of IntelliLink software and you never deal with us again.
Announcer: The MTV Video Music Awards will be back with a performance from Yo Gabba Gabba's Foofa singing, "Pound My Sweet Strange."
Stage hand: Two minutes, Foofa.
Ike: Get out of here, dude!
Kyle: Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
Host: All right, y'all, here comes our next big act!
Kyle: Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
Host: Give it up for the sexiest bitch on earth, it's Foofa!
Foofa: Come on, Ike. Ike?
Yo Gabba Gabba: Yaaaaay.
Terry: It was a mistake.
Wife: What?
Terry: Trying to reform Canada's health care system and being too stubborn to admit that it wasn't working. And even when my wife said the system was too complicated, I wouldn't listen.
Wife: Oh Terry, I was just trying to get your attention. I'm sorry I queefed in your face.
Terry: I deserved it. Anyone who thinks streamlining health care into an integreated health care system would go smoothly deserves a giant queef in their face. Thank you, my lady.
Wife: So IntelliLink is gone, my lord?
Terry: Yes, I've upgraded to the Gold package. Within no time, Canadians everywhere will be getting their correct medications, and going back to normal.
Kyle: Ike?
Dora: Come on, let's climb the mountain.
Kyle: It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
Dora: We made it all the way to the top.
Kyle: Yeah, I bet she does.
Ike: Yaaaay!
Kyle: About what?!
Craig: Where did you find a red-haired cow?
Butters: Whoa, look at it!
Cartman: What? What joke? This is real!
Kyle: Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
Butters: Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
Cartman: Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
Kyle: Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
Mr. Mackey: Your attention, please. Will Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office?
Kyle: Huh?
Mr. Mackey: Kyle Broflovski to the principal's office. Please. Umkay?
Butters: Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?
Butters: Busted!
Mr. Mackey: Ah, thanks for comin', Kyle.
Kyle: Wuwhat's going on?
Principal Victoria: Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator.
Mr. Mackey: Anything?
Kyle: He said they come on urgent business.
Principal Victoria: Ohh, what does he need?
Rabbi 2: Look, we believe that this school has something which is of the utmost importance to our people! We wish to see the red cow!
Kyle: The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
Principal Victoria: For what? What did he say, Kyle?
Kyle: It's right over here by uh-
Cleric 1: Yes! And you know you are about to die!
Kyle: Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
Kyle: NOOOO!
Rabbi 2: Very well, let us meet to discuss how the world as we know it ends.
Rabbi 1: Alright, so far we agree there'll be no automatic rifles, no shanks, and no chemical weapons.
Rabbi 3: But couldn't we agree on non-ballistic nuclear weapons only?
Bishop: Yeah, I suppose that's fine.
Cleric 2: That makes sense.
Rabbi 1: Non-ballistic nuclear only. Alright. Now on to prisoners. Are we all agreeing to decapitations?
Israeli: Of course we are! What do you think this is?!
Others: Yeah, come on! Just get to it!
Rabbi 1: If the cow is sacrificed in Israel according to the prophecy, then perhaps it could bring about peace.
Cartman: Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
Cartman: I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
Kyle: No shit!
Cartman: I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
Kyle: Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
Kyle: Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don't you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
Kyle: Dude, go to Hell!
Kyle: Mom?
Sheila: Hi bubbe.
Kyle: Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
Sheila: What is it, Kyle?
Stan: How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
Kyle: I just... thought it'd be nice.
Kyle: Yes sir.
Cartman: Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
Cartman: You what??
Kyle: Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
Craig: Dude, what the hell are you talking about?
Kyle: Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
Kyle: Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
Mr. Mackey: Come on in.
Mr. Mackey: Wuh sure, Kyle. What's the matter?
Kyle: If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
Mr. Mackey: Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?
Mr. Mackey: Well... why do you like his farts in your tummy?
Mr. Mackey: Well Kyle, that's kind of odd. Uh, not sure how to help you with that.
Kyle: Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
Kyle: Please...
Kyle: Yummy yummy.
Mr. Mackey: Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
Rabbi: No way no waaay!
Muslim: Epiiic!
Stan: Hey Kyle.
Kyle: Hey
Stan: Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
Kyle: I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.
Stan: ...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
Stan: You like... how they smell? How they taste?
Kyle: Yes.
Stan: They're really that good?
Kyle: Yes.
Stan: Should I try them?
Kyle: NO.
Ringtone: Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy.
Cartman: Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
Cartman: I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
Stan: ...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.
Kyle: Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
Stan: I don't get it, Kenny.
Kenny: (Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)
Stan: Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
Spirit: Kyle Broflovski.
Kyle: Huh? Who...? Who is that?
Spirit: Why do you endure all the farts, Kyle?
Kyle: I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
Spirit: What you are doing... is the most awesome thing ever.
Kyle: I... I know.
Spirit: Who else would take such torment?
Kyle: That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
Spirit: You should like, shave your head and get all peaceful about it. Your sacrifice saves the world.
Kyle: Yes.
Kyle: I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
Kyle: Yes! Yes I will!
Stan: Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
Butters: Just stop, please.
Craig: Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.
Stan: Hey Kyle.
Kyle: Hello, Stan.
Stan: Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
Kyle: There are greater things at work than what you understand.
Stan: If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
Kyle: I'm actually the complete opposite.
Stan: All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
Kyle: I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
Stan: See? You sound like a dick.
Stan: Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
Kyle: All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
Stan: I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
Kenny: (Huh? Like what?)
Stan: This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
Cartman: Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
Kyle: Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
Cartman: Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
Kyle: Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
Rabbi 1: Uh excuse me, I'm sorry everyone, but apparently there's some breaking news in the United States.
Reporter: We are in Colorado where the red cow was discovered, and apparently, two boys have shocking news that might change everything.
Kyle: Dude! Do not do this!
Stan: No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
Kyle: Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
Stan: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Kyle: I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
Stan: Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
Kyle: I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!
Stan: You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"
Kyle: Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
Stan: You should apologize to Kenny too.
Kyle: I'm sorry, Kenny!
Kenny: (That's okay, Kyle.)
Rabbi 1: No, what is the new information?!
Kyle: Hurray!
Rabbi 1: Oh no, it was a miracle?
Bishop: We are associating with these heathens for no reason!
Cartman: Small penis?!
Anchor: The party's over. Muslims, Jews, and Christians are back at each other's throats, and Israel is once again a place of conflict, and turmoil
Kyle: Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
Rabbi 3: No it di'n't.
Kyle: Yes! It did!
Rabbi 1: The prophecy was that a fat boy with a small penis would one day decorate a cow to look ginger. We should have known a prophecy like this... was too impossible to ever come to be.
Cartman: No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
Kyle: But it's the truth!
Cartman: No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
Kyle: Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
Randy: I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
Cartman: Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.
Cartman: Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
Clyde: Which nobody can afford.
Token: If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.
Cartman: I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
Butters: Woo, spooky.
Craig: Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real.
Male Anchor: Well it's almost Thanksgiving, and we all know what that means.
Female Anchor: That's right. Black Friday is right around the corner.
Male Anchor: Ouch.
Reporter: Tom, the South Park Mall says they've beefed up security in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year. One thing's for sure, people take Black Friday very seriously.
Stan: The House of Greyhawk?
Kyle: Larry and Brad Stoltsky
Cartman: But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
Cartman: Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
Guard 2: Enjoy the boredom while you can.
Guard 2: I did.
Randy: Is it really as bad as they say it is?
Butters: Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
Cartman: Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
Butters: Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
Cartman: What do you mean?
Butters: Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
Cartman: Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
Butters: Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
Kyle: Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
Boys: Yeah!
Cartman: That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
Craig: I thought we were getting Playstation 4's.
Jimmy: M ma um m-me too.
Cartman: ...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
Kyle: Yeah.
Jimmy: Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox.
Kyle: Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
Cartman: That's right.
Kyle: If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
Craig: Right. Let's all get PS4s.
Tweek: They're not better, they're just more expensive.
Cartman: We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
Craig: That's exactly how XBox people are!
Jimmy: Yeah!
Cartman: Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
Craig: We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!
Stan: I like the PS4's controller better.
Kyle: I know.
Sharon: Bullshit.
Sharon: Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?
Ensign: Thrusters are at 20%, captain.
Kevin: Engage, ensign. Warp factor 1.
Dougie: Captain, we have an incoming FaceTime request from Eric Cartman.
Cartman: Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
Kevin: Nothin' much. We're just about to check out a Class M planet that might have new sources of trillurillium.
Clyde: Just find out who they're loyal to.
Kevin: Given the XBox's faster frame rate, we have no choice but to declare it the most technologically fit for Starfleet.
Dougie: Cheap XBox Ones? For real?
Kyle: I don't know.
Kyle: This isn't helping us, Butters!
Clyde: The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.
Kenny: (What do you mean?)
Clyde: Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.
Cartman: What new Elmo doll?
Elmo: More! More! More! Aaaghghgh.
Announcer: Don't miss out on this holiday season's biggest gift! Stop touching me, Elmo!
Announcer 2: Available at South Park Mall staring Black Friday.
Randy: Morning, Joe, Marcus.
Guard 3: Morning, Randy.
Randy: What is it?
Guard 3: Oh Christ, no!
Guard 4: Oh, God, they're already lining up.
Shopper 1: Eelllmoooo
Guard 3: No! They can't line up this soon! This is crazy!
Old Cap: That's the line for Black Friday, so other people can do normal shopping today.
Shopper 4: Elmooo.
Shopper 5: Give me Elmo.
Stan: We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
Michael: Are you for real?
Jimmy: You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on.
Michael: Of course we're going to go with the PS4. They're blacker!
Stan: Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
Pete: Uhhh, we're just gonna wait until the PS4s become cheaper and more available.
Stan: No, you can't do that!
Jimmy: Ya yo you can't, you can't do that.
Stan: Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
Henrietta: What's Betamax?
Stan: Exactly!
Pete: What's VHS?
Stan: ...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
Michael: Sorry, I guess we just don't care enough.
Cartman: Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
Kenny: (Yes. What's up, my lord?)
Kenny: (But Stan and Kyle are best friends)
Cartman: You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
Kenny: (Yes, I believe we do.)
Cartman: Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
Man: No, it's my damned garden and I'm sick of you kids dressin' up and havin' talks of betrayal in it!
Randy: Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.
Old Cap: Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Randy: No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.
Old Cap: Listen, uh... I know why you took this part-time job.
Randy: You-d, you do?
Jimmy: C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club.
Craig: Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well.
Stan: And who do we have on our side?
Jimmy: Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton.
Stan: Did you ask the Vamp kids?
Craig: They're still undecided.
Boy: Playstation...
Jimmy: Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up.
Craig: We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing.
Stan: So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
Kenny: Previously, on South Park.
Stuart: What the hell is he wearin' now?
Scott: Aaah God ow sorry...
Cartman: The men are just inexperienced, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
Kyle: It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
Kyle: Sony released the PS4s, Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
Ballmer: Yes, hello. How are things going out there?
John: Sir, the tides of war are changing.
Dave: There's a king in Colorado, a young wizard who believes that Sony will have the upper hand if we do not come to his aid.
John: He claims that with our help, his followers are prepared to fight to the death over which system is better.
Ballmer: Uhh, what are you guys talking about? You sound ridiculous.
Ballmer: Guys, these are console wars, not some epic battle for a kingdom. I mean, come on.
Dave: ...but, this one kid said that he's a wizard, and that Sony is helping-
Ballmer: Guys, guys guys! It's just a video game machine, alright? Microsoft's a company that... tries to be above all the petty commercialism, okay?
Dave: Ok-Okay.
Tammy: Well, Black Friday is still a few days away, but it looks like it's already claimed another fatality.
Tom: Niles Lawson is on the scene, and Niles, what are you hearing?
Randy: Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
Guard 4: What?
Guard 5: Oh my God.
Guard 6: They can't do that!
Guard 7: What? That's 90% off!
Randy: Well, you're about to be.
Randy: You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
Cartman: Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick.
Butters: You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?
Butters: They don't!
Cartman: Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
Butters: Yeah, I finished it!
Cartman: So what happens when the dragons show up?
Butters: Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
Cartman: Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
Butters: Who's George R. R. Martin?
Homeowner: Hey! I told you kids to stay out of my damn yard!
Homeowner: Yeah?! Well how come every time you talk to somebody, it's about betraying somebody else?!
Cartman: Why don't you mind your own business?!
Secretary: Sir, Mr. Gates is here.
Ballmer: Not bad, you know? Just tryin' to get this next gen press stuff handled.
Gates: I heard there's a little trouble in uh, Colorado somewhere?
Ballmer: Oh it's- no, it turns out it was nothing, just some kids tryin' to turn the console wars into somethin' bigger.
Gates: Oh my gosh. You know, when I uh... stepped down and left you in charge of the company, Steve uh, I knew there might be some challenges for you.
Gates: Uh huh.
Butters: Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.
Scott: I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
Butters: Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
Butler: Who is this, please?
Butler: I'm sorry, but Mr. Martin does not see fans.
Butters: We're not fans!
Scott: Yeah, we don't like it!
Butters: We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
Butler: About what?
GRRM: It's the Red Wedding, isn't it? You hate how I killed everyone off?
Butters: Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
GRRM: Oh they're coming. The dragons are on their way.
Butters: When?
GRRM: You really wanna know?
GRRM: Alright, King Joffrey is still at King's Landing, but there's a young blacksmith who wakes up one morning with a plan. And His wiener gently hangs down between his legs. Soft and flaccid, his wiener glistened in the golden sunlight.
Butters: No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
Scott: Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint.
Butters: Uh what's the matter, Scott?
Scott: I told you I have to eat every two hours.
Butters: He's diabetic.
GRRM: Oh Jeez, uh, why don't you kids come out from the cold? I'll order some pizzas.
Butters: Oh. Okay, thanks.
Cartman: Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
Kyle: If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
Kyle: Grounded? For what?
Cartman: That could be up to you.
Kyle: No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
Kyle: What?
Cartman: Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
Cartman: Yeah!
Cartman: Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
Niles: Tom, I'm standing in your doorway because we have a hot news story to report.
Tammy: We don't go to work for another hour.
Tammy: He wants us to side with him?
Niles: That's right, Tammy. Let's not forget that having a bloodbath on Black Friday is good for the news. It's good for us. The bigger, the better.
Tom: Our job is to report the news, not make it more violent!
Announcer: It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson. Colorado's top-rated brother-sister news team.
Tom: Well Black Friday is just around the corner and Tammy, it's getting fierce out there.
Tammy: That's right, and Niles Lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise.
Gates: That's right. We just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their XBoxes at incredible deals on Friday, so we've come to offer swords and battle axes, whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers.
Niles: We understand that you've donated some guns to the kids as well.
Gates: Yes, but we are limiting it to one per XBox follower,, because of course, the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety.
Cartman: Hi, is Kenny home?
Mrs. McCormick: Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends.
Other kids: Protect the Princess! Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Get out!
Cartman: I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
Kenny: (Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Please, state your purpose.)
Cartman: You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.
Kenny: (You can change your mind instead of fighting us on Friday.)
Stan: The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
Cartman: Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
Stan: The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
Cartman: That doesn't even make sense.
Kyle: All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
Stan: I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
Stan: The gods will find us a way!
Butters: OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
Scott: If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out.
Scott: Ehhh...
Cartman: Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
Gates: Certainly. Uh, Eric, right?
Gates: Oh I certainly don't wanna step on your toes. Don't worry, I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want.
Cartman: Your CEOs?
Gates: Let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
Cartman: Uhhh, hmmm. What?
Cartman: Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
Niles: You know, Microsoft has given kids who want XBoxes on Black Friday a lot of support. Seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided.
President: Eh? Nani kore, tsukareta yo. (What? I'm tired!)
Niles: Black Friday is about to happen and it's not even gonna be a fight. That's bad for both of us. There must be something you can give to kids who want Sonys to make the fight more even.
GRRM: But this is the best part. Right before King Joffrey gets poisoned, everyone flaps their wieners all around his face.
Scott: Jeaaaaah!
GRRM: Okay, okay, fine fine. What kind of pizzas do you want?
Butters: What kind do we want?!
Scott: He hasn't even ordered the pizzas yet!
GRRM: Don't worry! They're coming! Not just two pizzas, there's, there's gonna be five! And they're gonna be huge! You won't believe it!
GRRM: Wait, I haven't told you what happens yet!
Butters: NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
GRRM: Well why didn't you say so? I can help with that.
Butters: Whatoyou mean?
Aide: The President of Sony bids you thanks for all your support of the PS4.
Craig: Wow, Kenny's a Japanese princess.
Guard 9: Oh God. We're done for!
Niles: Tom, we have breaking news from the South Park mall. In an effort to make sure everyone is prepared, the mall has decided to push Black Friday by one week!
Sony President: Oh!
Clyde: Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.
Cartman: Because, because what? Because he's cute?
Kyle: Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
Cartman: But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
Kyle: This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
Cartman: He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!
Kyle: Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
Cartman: So what are you saying, Kyle?!
Rick: Yes, yes that's right, we had to eat him. We were all sort of starving out here, so we drew straws, and he drew the shortest one.
Niles: What is it you're hoping to get when Black Friday does finally start?
Rick: A a Blu-ray player. Ninety-six percent off, it's gonna be about 20 bucks.
Niles: Now, some people might say that eating your child is not very Christmasy. What would you say to them?
Niles: No doubt Christmas is alive and well at the South Park Mall. Back to you, Tom.
Craig: At Red Robin?
Jimmy: That's right. Red Robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall.
Stan: The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
Craig: So how do we take over Black Robin?
Stan: I have no idea.
Stan: Yes?
Pete: The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?
Kyle: Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.
Cartman: Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
Craig: Haha.
Cartman: Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
Clyde: Nobody saw that coming.
Kyle: Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
Kyle: Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
Craig: Hey, that could work.
Stan: And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
Man: Eh?!
Cartman: Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
Stan: Yeah, sure, what about it?
Stan: Why?
Stan: Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
Cartman: Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
Cartman: Dude! Dude!
Cartman: Dude, shut the fuck up!
Stan: Who is that?
Cartman: He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
Homeowner: They're gonna lock you in!
Cartman: God damn it, shut up!
Homeowner: He talked about it in my garden to like three other people! They're gonna lock you in the Red Robin and go get all the XBoxes! That's why he wants you to stay back from the doors!
Stan: Did Kyle know about this?
Stan: Did Kyle know about this?!
Homeowner: Fuck you, get out of my garden!
Cartman: I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
Tammy: Well, the wait is over and Black Friday is finally here.
Tom: Niles Lawson is at the scene, and it's about time, Niles.
Butters: Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
GRRM: That may be true, but horses have one quality that is unmatched by any other mode of transportation.
Cartman: Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?
Manager: Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?
Cartman: Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyonc.
Manager: It's, it's real? It's for real? Oho my God, I love them!
Cartman: Yesh, kewl.
Manager: So Beyonc is not with Jay-Z anymore?
Cartman: Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
Manager: Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?
Cartman: Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
Cartman: Yes, he did.
Kyle: Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
Cartman: What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
Kyle: No. Tell me you didn't!
Sharon: He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.
Kyle: Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.
Sharon: And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.
Kyle: Stan, it's me.
Stan: Get out of here!
Kyle: Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
Stan: You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
Kyle: You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
Kyle: You didn't?
Stan: ...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
Kyle: I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
Stan: You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
Guard 6: We're not gonna make it, sir.
Randy: We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!
Guard 6: Okay.
Randy: OKAY?!
Guard 6: Yes sir! Yes sir.
Guard 3: Oh my God!
Guard 8: They're comin' in through the roof!
GRRM: Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to be here this morning on behalf of South Park Mall Partners and channel 9 News, your go-to source for news, weather, and sports.
Manager: Hey, sorry guys. Red Robin is closed for a special event today.
Pete: Yeah, we know. We're with the wedding.
Kenny: (My boobs? You flatter me, Grand Wizard!)
Clyde: The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.
Shopper 10: Enough with the wieners already!
Shopper 11: Yeah, come on!
Cartman: Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
Cartman: What the hell is this?!
Kyle: I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
Cartman: Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
Kyle: I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
Cartman: Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
Kyle: The fight is over, Cartman!
Cartman: Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
Kyle: Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
Cartman: They're not a part of your betrayal?
Kyle: No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
Stan: We're done with betrayals! It's time to put an end to this!
Kyle: Stan?
Guard 3: Sir? Sir, Operations just said they need one of us to unlock the door to Red Robin to let some wedding party inside the mall!
Randy: Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!
Guard 3: Tom Hanks and Beyonc.
Cartman: Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
Sharon: Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!
Cartman: We'd like to get XBox Ones please.
Randy: [Silently carries a flat panel television past the mass of dead bodies.]
Niles: Tom, the shopping frenzy is over, and it looks like Microsoft's new XBox One is this year's hot item. No doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console. Black Friday is over. There's been death, violence, horrible human behavior... and the big winner here, decidedly, is Channel 9 News.
Cartman: The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
Stan: Yes, it is.
Butters: The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
Kyle: Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
Cartman: I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
Stan: Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
Cartman: The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
The Boys: Yeah, you're right. You make a point.
The Boys: Yeah!
Announcer: The South Park video game, coming to stores soon!
Heidi: Heidi!
Nichole: Nichole!
Bebe: Bebe!
Lola: Lola!
Red: Red!
Annie: Annie!
Annie: Oh God.
Red: Here we go.
Nichole: Ugh.
Bebe: Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?
Wendy: You guys stop it! Okay Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?
Lisa: But I'm the fat one.
Wendy: What?
Lisa: Every cheerleading squad has a fat ugly cheerleader and that's me.
Wendy: See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?
Heidi: There's only one boy that Lisa cares about.
Red: Yeah, Lisa has a crush on Butters.
Lisa: Shut up!
Wendy: But Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?
Lisa: No way. I I'd just get made fun of.
Wendy: Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!
Butters: So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-
Lisa: Uh, excuse me. Butters?
Butters: Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
Craig: Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl.
Cartman: You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
Butters: Oh. Hey Wendy.
Wendy: Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!
Butters: Am I just an asshole?
Wendy: Yeah!
Butters: Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
Wendy: Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!
Butters: Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
Wendy: She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!
Butters: Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
Wendy: What?!
Butters: You're a liar!
Mr. Mackey: Uh, take a seat, Wendy. I guess some mean things were said and I need to get to the bottom of it.
Mr. Mackey: Uh, no Wendy, apparently, you called Butters' girlfriend a hobbit.
Wendy: ...Are you serious?
Butters: You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
Wendy: That's not his girlfriend! It's Kim Kardashian!
Mr. Mackey: Uh but, but Wendy, Kim Kardashian is considered to be extremely beautiful, mkay?
Wendy: Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit.
Butters: Oh, she said it again!
Mr. Mackey: Now, Wendy, Kim might be uh, full-figured, but a woman's outward appearance isn't all that matters, mkay?! Have you stopped to consider that maybe, just maybe, you're jel?
Wendy: I'm not "jel", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school!
Mr. Mackey: Uh that may be true, but there is a very fine line, Wendy, between being a feminist and being a hater, mkay? And you're gonna have to find that line because nobody likes a girl who's jelly!
Kanye: Uh-huh. Uh-huh, that's right
Wendy: Butters. Butters, come here for a sec.
Butters: Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
Wendy: Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?
Wendy: I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?
Butters: Okay.
Butters: That's Lisa Berger?
Wendy: Do you see what I'm talking about?
Butters: She's pretty!
Wendy: That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.
Butters: Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
Wendy: What? What do you mean?
Wendy: Butters!
Cartman: I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
Butters: II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
Cartman: Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
Butters: What?! Well since when?
Token: Wow, she's hot.
Tweek: Oh man, you're a lucky guy.
Craig: Hey Clyde. Nice score, dude.
Other boys: Yeah.
Jimmy: Yeah. I wouldn't mind t-tah-t-tappin' that ass.
Wendy: Excuse me!
Stan: Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
Wendy: Why would I be jel?
Jimmy: Well, y-you gotta admit, Lisa Berger is pretty hot, Wendy.
Wendy: She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point!
Stan: She looks pretty hot here.
Jimmy: That's not very nice, Wendy.
Lisa: What's your problem, Wendy?
Lisa: You're just a hater. Why don't you mind your own business instead of being jelly?
Wendy: I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way!
Lisa: Thanks, babe.
Mr. Mackey: Now Wendy, I've tried to be patient with you 'cause you've always been a good student! M'kay?! But calling a little girl fat and ugly is NEVER m'kay!
Wendy: Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that-
Mr. Mackey: No! No excuses! You have a problem bein' jelly, Wendy! Okay?! Just maybe, I should have you sent off to jelly school!
Wendy: Jelly school?
Wendy: Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make.
Mr. Mackey: Yuh, you do? Okay, well I'm not actually on the phone with a... jelly school, Wendy, okay?
Wendy: Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes.
Wendy: Thank you, Mr. Mackey, I will... change.
Mr. Mackey: M-okay.
Pope Francis: Gracias, gracias, all of my children.
Heidi: Heidi!
Nichole: Nichole!
Bebe: Bebe!
Lola: Lola!
Red: Red!
Annie: Annie!
Red: Look, Wendy, we are all very happy for Lisa, okay? Nobody here is jelly. But the boys aren't even noticing the rest of us anymore.
Bebe: All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.
Wendy: I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!
Heidi: Why?! Don't you care about us?!
The Boys: Wooowww!
Jimmy: Wow! Wow! She looks great!
The Boys: Wooowww!
Clyde: Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys.
Kyle: Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
Cartman: Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
Stan: Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
Stan: A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
Wendy: So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!
Stan: Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
Wendy: Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.
Wendy: Ugh!
Heidi: Heidi!
Nichole: Nichole!
Bebe: Bebe!
Lola: Lola!
Red: Red!
Annie: Annie!
Lisa: Lisa Berger!
Nichole, Lola, Annie: Ugh.
Bebe: You suck!
Heidi: Oh God.
Red, Annie: Ugh.
Bebe: Can we try this without Wendy?
Lola: I agree!
Wendy: Let's just get back to cheering, okay?!
Heidi: I don't think so! We don't wanna cheer with a hater!
Bebe: Yeah! You have a bad self-image, Wendy! You need to go down to the gym and get a better one!
Annie: Yeah!
Lola: Uh huh!
Red: That's right!
Bebe: What are you gonna do?!
Announcer: It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson.
Tammy: A little girl is making big waves with her fight against Photoshop.
Wendy: Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.
Tom: And you're not just... being a hater.
Wendy: ...Nooo.
Tom: 'Cause sometimes, girls who aren't well-liked, you know, lash out at pretty and popular girls. Are, are you well-liked at your school?
Tom: Uh huh. But you're not being jelly?
Wendy: NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!
Tom: Okay, because I do understand that the jelly school in Aurora is ready to take you in. Is that right, Rick?
Rick: Tom, I'm standing in front of the jelly school, where officials claim they do have room for this little hater girl. We're being told if she doesn't stop the-
Wendy: That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts!
Wendy: Agh! What do you want?
Wendy: Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly.
Wendy: No no, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry.
Kanye: Sorry, sorry, that's okay. I've been jelly before too. I'm sorry.
Cartman: Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.
Stan: Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
Kyle: Barking vaginal belch.
Cartman: Protruding vaginal boner.
Kenny: (Dilapidated titties incorporated.)
Stan: Nah.
Kyle: Bloody butt cough.
Stan: Angry Clit Spasm
Stan: Whooping Fart Balls.
Registrar: Nnnnnope.
Stan: Lubricated Titty Burgers.
Registrar: That's taken too.
Registrar: Sorry.
Cartman: Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
Kyle: How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
Cartman: Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
Registrar: That's available! Congratulations!
Kyle: It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
Stan: Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
Butters: Man this sucks!
Stan: No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
Randy: A startup company? A company that does what?
Stan: No, we don't wanna do anything.
Kyle: Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
Butters: Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
Randy: Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
Stan: What?
Kyle: What?! Tell us!
Kyle: Washington Redskins?
Cartman: It's sooo sweet!
Stan: I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.
Cartman: It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
Kenny: (Me too!)
Kyle: What?!
Cartman: Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
Kyle: Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.
Cartman: Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
Kyle: Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
Kyle: Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
Kyle: I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
Butters: One dollar pledge!
Cartman: I told you guys! "Washington Redskins" totally gets people's attention!
Butters: Another two dollars!
Kyle: No way!
Cartman: Sittin' on our asses, here we come!
Teen Boy: I dunno, I just. Uh. They don't do anything, that's pretty sweet. I dunno, I thought it was funny.
News 4 Anchor: It's called crowd-funding, using the Internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors, a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal.
Cartman: Yes, I know.
Dan Snyder: My name is Dan Snyder. I'm the president and owner of the Washington Redskins
Cartman: Oh, cool. Please take a seat.
Dan Snyder: Thank you, but I will stand.
Cartman: Nice, I like that.
Dan Snyder: Young man, we ask that you please stop using the name Washington Redskins for your organization.
Cartman: Stop? But why?
Dan Snyder: Because we are the Washington Redskins, and we are a football team! You have NO right to use our name to get attention!
Dan Snyder: Look! Don't you see that when you call your organization "The Washington Redskins", its offensive to us?
Cartman: How is it offensive?
Coach: How is it offensive?! Jesus, what-?!
Dan Snyder: We are a proud team, Mr. Cartman! We have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing!
Coach: Makes us feel like a joke
Dan Snyder: Uh, I know I can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency?
Flight attendant: All around the world, people are saying they are inspired by the Washington Redskins. The Internet startup company has raised so much money in Kickstarter that now, more groups are doing the same.
Cartman: Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
Cartman: Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
Kyle: People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
Kyle: That's the Catholic Church!
Cartman: NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
Kyle: That's the NFL!
Cartman: It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
Kyle: All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
Cartman: Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
Kyle: Maybe I'll start my own company.
Cartman: Well that's fine! You can't call yourself "Washington Redskins!"
Cartman: Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
Kyle: Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
Cartman: Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
Stan: I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
Butters: Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
Dan Snyder: Is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to ISIS. You have to do something, Commissioner Goodell! What are you going to do about this?!
Dan Snyder: What?!
Goodell: We will continue to identify and add expertise to our team.
Dan Snyder: That's the most ridiculous nothing answer I've ever heard! What are you gonna do now?!
Goodell: Everyone will participate in educating sessions starting in the next month.
Dan Snyder: Ugh! This thing is broken!
Dan Snyder: Get all the NFL owners on Skype! This thing is broken again!
Dan Snyder: And so I call upon the help of all owners. You cannot let my people be belittled like this!
Jim Irsay: Dan, you don't wanna be dealin' with this stuff. Let the Goodell-bot do it.
Dan Snyder: The stupid thing isn't working!
Steve Bischiotti: Man, that thing hasn't worked right since we bought it.
Dan Snyder: Look, my team is starting to lose hope. You have to use your influence to make these people change their name.
Paul Allen: Did you tell them we're about honor and integrity?
Alex Spanos: If the Goodell bot is broken, we must stay out of it more than even usual!
Dan Snyder: And so I'm alone? What if they ridicule the 49ers team next? Or make fun of Jerry Jones because his eyes are too far apart?
Jerry Jones: My eyes aren't too far apart!
Paul Allen: If we get them to change their logo, will it make you happy?
Dan Snyder: Uh I guess we can live with that.
Jim Irsay: Then it is decided! We will make them change their logo. Begin mas behind-the-scenes under-the-table enforcement of our wishes NOW
Dan Snyder: Thank God!
Kyle: It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
Stan: Yeah...
Kyle: You okay, bro?
Stan: I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."
Kyle: Give it time, it'll grow on you.
Stan: Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?
Kyle: Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
Stan: Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
Kyle: Well whattaya mean?
Stan: I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
Stan: Good luck with your company, dude.
Employee: It's just... incredible, Harry. Everyone is using Kickstarter for everything!
Harry: And for every project funded, we get 5%.
Employee: It's like, we don't even have to do anything and we just make money.
Harry: Sitting on our asses, here we come.
Cartman: Goooood morning, guys!
Butters: Happy Deadline Day!
Cartman: We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
Butters: Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!
Butters: It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
Kenny: (What?!)
Butters: Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
Cartman: What?!
Butters: Somebody killed Kickstarter!
Cartman: You song of a bitch!
Kyle: What?!
Cartman: You broke Kickstarter!
Kyle: No, I just can't get it to load.
Cartman: Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
Kyle: My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
Cartman: Well, somebody did!
Kyle: He's right. We should do a merger.
Stan: And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
Butters: Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
Kyle: Whattaya say, Cartman?
Cartman and Kyle: Go Redskins!
Announcer: A beautiful night in Arlington, Texas as the Dallas Cowboys get set to take on the Washington Redskins. That is, of course, Washington Redskins the football team, not Washington Redskins, the audacious crowd-funding company.
Commentator: Yeah, and if you ask me, the Redskins are a scam.
Announcer: You're talking about the crowd-funding company- Redskins, right?
Commentator: That's right. An-and now you've got terrorist groups like ISIS using the Redskins to raise their money. I-I don't like what the Redskins are doing.
Announcer: Those Redskins
Commentator: Yeah, whatever.
#35: It's over. Our name has been reduced to a stereotype and a joke.
#59: Yeah, let's just go home.
Dan Snyder: No. No, we cannot give up! We have been through too much together. We have fought Eagle, and Bear! The Eagles only beat us by three points.
#92: Yeah, but I just feel pretty stupid wearing this now.
#72: Yeah.
#35: Come on, guys.
Announcer: And the Cowboys are still set to kick off, but there doesn't seem to be anyone to kick off to.
Crowd: Oh!
Fan wearing #3: Just stay down! For the love of God!
Fan wearing #74: Stop! Make it stop!
Fan wearing #82: Just stay down!
Another fan: Please!
Fan wearing a blue star: Just make him stay down!
Other fans: Go Redskins! Go Redskins!
Stan: Boy, this is the life, huh guys?
Butters: We finally did it!
Cartman: Whoa, whoa! What?
Protestor #1: Change your name!
Protestor #2: It doesn't belong in today's society!
Kyle: Change our name?
Stan: But you all thought our name was sweet.
Protestor #3: There's nothing sweet about a people who were decimated. A once proud nation that finally lost hope and left their leader to be massacred by Cowboys in a defiant last stand!
Kyle: When was that?
Protestor #4: Last night.
Protestor #5: Until you change your name, we are asking all your subscribers to boycott you.
ISIS Spokesman: That's right! ISIS will no longer use your insensitive company for its fundraising!
Crowd: Yeah! Alright!
Protestor #1: Good for you, ISIS!
Kyle: Well what the hell do we do?
Kyle: Hey guys!
Stan: Morning!
Cartman: How's it going, everybody?
Craig: What are you guys doing here?
Cartman: What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
Jimmy: I thought you guys said you didn't need school.
Token: Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.
Kyle: Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
Craig: But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
Cartman: Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
Kyle: We were- trying to be funny.
Wendy: You're... back?
Stan: Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
Stan: So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
Wendy: You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be "free to chase your dreams".
Stan: Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
Cartman: Dude, people are pissed off at us.
Kenny: (Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)
Kyle: Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?
Cartman: Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
Kyle: Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
Pricipal Victoria: All right everyone, thanks for coming. As you know, we urgently need to discuss the matter of Butters Stotch, who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back. Are we all set to start?
Woman: Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.
Mr. Adler: Awww, do we need Mackey here?
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing.
Principal Victoria: Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.
Mr. Adler: He doesn't look any different to me.
Principal Victoria: In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?
Mr. Mackey: Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay?
Principal Victoria: Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.
Mr. Mackey: I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing
Principal Victoria: Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.
Mr. Mackey: That's probably gluten, m'kay?
Coach: Oh, God!
Mr. Mackey: Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems,
Mr. Garrison: I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
Mr. Mackey: See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.
Kyle: I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
Kenny: (Right. What the fuck is going on?)
Kenny: (A party?!)
Cartman: Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
Kyle: Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
Cartman: Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
Cartman: Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...
Cartman: What?
Kyle: No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
Cartman: We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
Kyle: A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
Stan: Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
Cartman: Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
Kenny: (This will be awesome!)
Cartman: So who do we throw the party for?
DJ: All right, that was "Get This Party Started" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys?
Kyle: Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.
Cartman: You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
DJ: Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct?
Cartman: You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
Stan: Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
DJ: Must be pretty special having a big party in your honor, Scott. How does it feel?
Scott: I actually have plans this weekend.
Cartman: "I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."
DJ: All right, well, we've got lots of people callin' in. Caller, what's your question?
Craig: Are you guys making this up?
Kyle: Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
Craig: All the pizza we can eat?
Cartman: Believe it, dude.
Craig: All right, this better be good.
DJ: All right, it's sure to be a blast. Phone lines are going craaazy!
Stan: Sweet!
DJ: Next caller, what's your question?
Principal Victoria: Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?
Stan: Excuse me?
Principal Victoria: Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.
DJ: Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment?
Mark: Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like "Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"
DJ: All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys?
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face.
Cartman: What the hell is gluten?
John Garner: Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight.
John Garner: People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that's a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say "Well there's fat in butter too," but that's just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten?
Mr. Garrison: Yes, thank you!
Mr. Mackey: Then eat it!
John Garner: Excuse me?
Mr. Mackey: If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?
Stephen: Get out! You're not safe!
Mr. Garrison: You gotta get out!
Stephen: Hurry! You gotta go!
Randy: What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?
Sharon: Yes!
Randy: Hamburger Helper?
Sharon: That's all gluten!
Randy: There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!
Sharon: Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.
Randy: Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!
Sharon: It's in the Triscuits too, Randy!
Stan: Wait, wait, ah I might need those.
Randy: This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!
Sharon: Don't forget the freezer!
Sharon: I don't know! Look at the ingredients!
Randy: Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!
Sharon: All right, that's all of it!
Randy: You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!
Sharon: I can get both of these, yeah!
Kyle: Hey Cartman.
Cartman: KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
Kyle: Dude, calm down.
Cartman: THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
Cartman: KYYYLE!
Mr. Garrison: Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!
Farmer: What are you doing to my farm?!?
Tom Vilsack: There's panic all over the country and you're telling me you don't have any kind of containment on this thing?!
Researcher: We're working as fast as we can, sir.
Tom Vilsack: We told people that whole wheat bread was healthy! Isn't wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy?
Researcher: No. We believe now that that's poppycock.
Kyle: Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
Cartman: What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
Stan: We can't let our party suck.
Cartman: What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
Kyle: That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
Cartman: You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
Kyle: Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
Randy: Yes?
Worker 1: Hello, sir. We've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home. May we come in?
Randy: Gluten expohn... oh not here!
Worker 2: Can we come in please?
Randy: Well that's just a beer.
Worker 1: Oh Jesus.
Shelly: BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!
Worker 2: We're gonna need you to come with us, sir. Don't touch me.
Randy: Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?
Worker 1: We just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on.
Randy: How long do I have to stay here?!
Soldier: Until the USDA gets control of the situation, sir.
Randy: What am I supposed to eat?
Randy: Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.
Jeff: We're trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there, but... It seems impossible to contain.
Tom Vilsack: And we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves?
Agent: Sir, the feds are here.
Tom Vilsack: Oh shit!
FDA Agent 1: Tom Vilsack?
Tom Vilsack: Yes?
Michael Taylor: Michael Taylor, FDA.
Tom Vilsack: Yeah, thank you, but this is a USDA problem.
Michael Taylor: Anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too!
Stan: Dad? Dad!
Stan: Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
Randy: I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?
Stan: Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
Randy: How's your mom? Your, your sister?
Stan: Nonono, not yet. DAD!
Randy: That's my son, you bastard!
Soldier 2: I'm sorry, all right?
Stan: Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
Randy: Staaan!
Randy: Staaaaaaan!
Craig: You call this a party?! Your party sucks!
Token: Come on guys, let's go!
Aunt Jemima: There's people in trouble, Eric. They need to be shown the way.
Cartman: I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.
Aunt Jemima: You need to get to the USDA, child. They're lookin' for a sign.
Cartman: I don't even know what that means.
Aunt Jemima: When you're stuck, look to the pyramids.
Cartman: Are you going to eat those pancakes?
Cartman: Oooo, trippy...
Aunt Jemima: Tell then they've got's it backwards!
Randy: You can't just keep us in here!
Mr. Garrison: There's nothing left, I told you.
Blond: There's plenty of pizza dough.
Randy: Are you crazy?
Blond: You don't think it's a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic? This whole thing was a setup, man!
Mr. Garrison: A setup? But by who?
Randy: Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.
Stan: There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
DJ: Well all right, time for action indeed. Let's go to the phone lines. Go ahead, caller.
Craig: I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.
Kyle: We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
Craig: Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?
DJ: All right, let's go to Jamie in Como. Go ahead.
Jamie: It's like ya... ya say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away! It's kind of like.... telling everyone to go fuck themselves!
DJ: Oh Kansas, watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air.
Wendy: Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?
Stan: I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
Wendy: So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.
Scott: That is correct, yes, I do.
Wendy: You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?
Kyle: Jesus Christ, dude.
Stan: Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
Wendy: Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!
Stan: We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
DJ: Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric?
Cartman: KYYYLE!
Kyle: Cartman?
Cartman: KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!
Tom Vilsack: It's dinner time on the East coast in less than an hour. People are going to die!
Jeff White: Sir! They've got a boy on the hot line who says he might know something.
Tom Vilsack: Who is this?
Cartman: My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
Cartman: What, what is it? What is it for?
Tom Vilsack: We built the pyramid a long time ago to illustrate how much people should eat of the four basic food groups.
Programmer: Sir, we abandoned the pyramid when Michelle Obama got involved.
Tom Vilsack: The pyramid down't work. We already tried it.
Cartman: It's upside down.
Tom Vilsack: What?
Cartman: Sir, the pyramid is upside down.
Tom Vilsack: Turn the pyramid upside down.
Programmer 2: You can't be serious. That would put butter and fat at the top of the-
Tom Vilsack: Flip the damned food pyramid!
Michael Taylor: This is NOT FDA-approved!
Programmer 3: Sir, we've got a match.
Programmer 4: Nutrition is stabilizing!
Tom Vilsack: Get the President on the phone. Tell him... to have some steak with his butter.
Kyle: Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
Tom Vilsack: We really dodged a bullet, young man. Thanks to you, America knows what to eat again.
Cartman: Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
Tom Vilsack: We're gonna get a better view of the stage.
Jeff White: Wait till my girls see that I was at a party with Lorde!
Clyde: I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.
Jimmy: Yeah, she isn't as hot in person.
Stan: Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?
Wendy: Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.
Stan: Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
Wendy: You're so transparent, Stan.
Stan: What does that mean?
Kyle: Are you okay, Cartman?
Craig: Occupied.
Cartman: I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
Craig: You can't call dibs on a toilet.
Kyle: Then don't eat 14 Eggo waffles for lunch, fatass!
Wendy: What the hell do you think you're doing?
Cartman: I'm going to the potty.
Wendy: This is the girls bathroom!
Cartman: Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
Wendy: WHAT?!
Wendy: GET OUT OF HERE!
Red: What the hell is that?!
Wendy: Cartman is using our bathroom!
Cartman: Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.
Red: Hey! I'm gonna tell on you!
Principal Victoria: I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!
Cartman: Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girl's shitter.
Principal Victoria: You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!
Cartman: Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.
Principal Victoria: All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!
Cartman: That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
Principal Victoria: Alright, listen Eric!
Cartman: Erica.
Principal Victoria: Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!
Cartman: All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.
Principal Victoria: With the what?!
Mr. Garrison: Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.
Mr. Mackey: But then cisgender-ed is just normal
Principal Victoria: But this isn't a hurt and confused child we're talking about. This is Eric Cartman.
Mr. Garrison: Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants.
Principal Victoria: Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?
Reporter: Gerald Broflovski?
Gerald: Yes?
Brandon Carlile: Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I was hoping you could help me... make sense of somethin'. I understand you had a very large party in your back yard last... last Sunday, was it?
Brandon Carlile: I also understand that a very famous pop artist, Lorde, was the entertainment at that party.
Gerald: Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.
Brandon Carlile: Well it, eh, it's just a little curious, you know? Why a hugely popular Top-20 artist would play such a... well no offence, but such a humble venue?
Gerald: ...Sorry, I don't think I get your-
Gerald: From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.
Brandon Carlile: You wouldn't know who?
Gerald: No. Does it really matter?
Sharon: Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?
Randy: In my jeans?
Sharon: Randy? Do you have something to tell me?
Sia: Yeah! Recess is almost over!
Cartman: There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
Sia: Not while you're in here!
Cartman: Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
Wendy: Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-
Principal Victoria: Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.
Cartman: I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. [poops and farts]
Cartman: Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
Principal Victoria: Would that be agreeable to you?
Cartman: OH MY GOD!!!
Wendy: That isn't fair!
Red: Wendy, just go with it!
Cartman: Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
Cartman: Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.
Designer: Uh huh, well why don't you put the water feature on this side?
Cartman: Oh on that side?
Designer: You know, because you've already got AC over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall.
Cartman: Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
Randy: Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.
Randy: You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
Record Executive: How many times have you said "I think I've lost it" and everything turned out to be okay?
Randy: Every time?
Record Executive: Every time. Come on. Get back to work and see. If you get panicked again, call me.
Ron: You wanted to see me?
Ron: What?
Record Executive: He writes the songs, sends us the demos, we fudge them, sell them as a brooding 17-year-old girl way ahead of her time, and nobody knows the difference.
Record Executive: He makes good stuff. Stuff that sells. But he's getting edgy feet. I want you to keep an eye on him. And if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth, well... you know what to do.
Stan: What is that?
Butters: That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.
Stan: Cartman's a girl now?
Brandon Carlile: Peter Nelson?
Nelson: Yes?
Nelson: Yeah, that's right.
Brandon Carlile: I also understand that you're the uncle of the amazing and talented songwriter, Lorde?
Nelson: I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.
Brandon Carlile: How's that?
Nelson: Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology.
Brandon Carlile: The what?
Clyde: Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.
Red: ...Wendy?
Wendy: How's it hanging'?
Craig: Whoa..
Jenny: Huh?
Jason: Whoa, wait, is that?
Butters: Holy moly! [Wendy pulls out a key and goes into the Other bathroom]
Cartman: Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
Wendy: It's cool. I'll wait.
Cartman: DUDE, THIS IS MY FUCKING BATHROOM!
Cartman: I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!
Principal Victoria: I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-
Cartman: Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
Principal Victoria: You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?
Cartman: BECAUSE I DON'T WANT A CHICK WATCHING ME GO POO!
Principal Victoria: I thought you were a chick.
Randy: Shelly, that's enough time on your phone.
Shelly: Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!
Randy: You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
Stan: Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
Randy: Oh really? A-About... about what?
Randy: Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde.
Stan: ...What?
Randy: It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.
Stan: Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
Randy: Yah, that's my cover.
Stan: The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
Stan: Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.
Stan: Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.
Stan: ...I don't know where I belong...
Cartman: HEY, WHAT THE FUCK DUDE?! GOD FUCKING DAMN IT!
Cartman: Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
Principal Victoria: Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom?
Stan: I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
Cartman: He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
Boss: Yes. Please have a seat, Lorde.
Boss: Lorde, we're all big fans of your music and we think the world of you for staying and working here even after your music career took off.
Randy: Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.
Randy: I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.
Announcer: You are watching E! Entertainment News! That's how low you've sunk.
Cartman: Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
Butters: Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
Butters: Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!
Cartman: Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
Sharon: You just gonna drink beer alone all day?
Principal Victoria: Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.
Butters: Hey! Where do you think you're going?!
Stan: To the bathroom?
Sheila: Sure. You bet.
Gerald: Are you guys parked over here?
Stephen: Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way.
Gerald: A Handicar? What's that?
Linda: You don't use Handicar?
Stephen: No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up.
Gerald: Wow...
Gerald: Lucky.
Russian: You don't like puke?
Passenger: Could you turn the radio down and the air conditioning up, please?
Passenger: Agh!
Russian: Not enough people taking cab. Don't know what's wrong!
Russian: What the fuck?
Younger Man: No thanks.
Younger Man: Oh, here's our Handicar.
Mr. Stevenson: The fuck?
All: Yeeaahhh!
Steve: So far, Jimmy has raised $16!
All: Yeeaahhh!
Mimsy: D'awww, we don't like camp, boss?
Nathan: We hate camp, Mimsy. The singing, the competitions, Jimmy Valmer getting all the chicks.
Nathan: Shut up, Mimsyyyy! I'm not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes. We gotta find a way to put Handicar out of business, and fast.
Mimsy: D'ah oh boy! We're gonna wreck Timmy's business, huh boss?
Steve: Hey boys, are you excited for camp next year?
Nathan: Yes, Counselor Steve. We like the tug-of-waaarr.
Nathan: Come on, Mimsy, we gotta figure out how we're gonna make Handicar a thing of the past.
Mimsy: D'oh boy!
Mr. Stevenson: Well I don't have any children.
Russian: Who does this handicapped boy think he is?! He's not even in union!
Arab: He's taking all our business because people find it more coomvenient.
SP Cabbie: Aaand, because he's handicapped, he can use special access points and parking spaces. That kid was born with an unfair advantage!
Arab: Who is this rat?!
American: Who are you?!
Nathan: Just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs. That's all.
Russian: Nobody takes jobs away from US! We need to speak to Mayor and tell her to shut down this illegitimate business!
Arab: Or maybe we can have the police shut him down!
Mimsy: Hey I got an idea! Why don't you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer, and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with Handicar's popularity in the marketplace?
Nathan: Just ignore my friend. He's mentally disabled.
Mimsy: Aw yeah, don't mind me.
Nathan: Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake?
Mr. Stevenson: Offer it last year's Christmas in Rocksummer prizes?
SP Cabbie: Hey wake up, you little scab!
SP Cabbie: Yeah, we sure did!
Russian: Let's just say he'll be laid up a while.
SP Cabbie: Yeah. We snuck in his room last night and we... broke his legs!
Nathan: Oh boy, that's great-wait, you what??
Russian: But we broke his legs. Both of them.
Nathan: Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS!
Nathan: How can people be so ineffectual, Mimsy?
Mimsy: D'uh I don't know, boss.
Nathan: These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.
Mimsy: D'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs. Maybe Handicar is a kind of economic natural selection, where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones. Drrrrr.
Timmy: Timmy!
Nathan: Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan.
Timmy: Timmih!
Nathan: Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle.
Nathan: I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business.
Nathan: I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers.
Mimsy: D'ah I don't get it boss. I thought you hated Handicar. How come now you wanna work for 'em?
Nathan: It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers.
Mimsy: D'ahhh, sexual harassment, boss?
Nathan: It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me.
Mimsy: D'ah oh boy!
Nathan: Uh oh!
Gerald: Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.
Stephen: Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila.
Gerald: Stephen, what are you doing?
HC Driver 1: Timmy!
Stephen: Timmy!
Stephen: The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald.
Nathan: I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one!
Nathan: Shut up Mimsyyy!
Elon Musk: Today I am proud to announce the Tesla D, the most innovative and efficient world-friendly mode of transportation ever created. Any questions?
Reporter 1: Yes, ahh, what about Handicar?
Elon Musk: What about it?!
Reporter 2: Well all over the country prople are realzing that using an app to ride-share is even more convenient and eco-friendly than electric cars.
Elon Musk: I am so sick of hearing about app-based ride-sharing! The future of transportation is the electric cars, not wheelchairs!
Exec. 1: Don't worry, Elon. Handicar is just a small company.
Exec. 2: Oh sure, operating in a few small towns, but when they start absorbing the taxi markets, bringing taxi sservice to any part of the world, driving your kids to and from school, delivering both people and things?
Exec. 3: We can't compete with Handicar! It's just so damned handy!
Nathan: Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake?
Elon Musk: Who's the sheepherder?
Nathan: You are.
Exec. 4: Who's the snake?
Mimsy: D'ah, it's an analogy.
Nathan: Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?
Elon Musk: Good day to you!
Timmy: Timmih!
Nathan: Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours.
Randy: Wacky Races?! Holy shit!
CNN Anchor: The prime minister of Japan (Shinzo Abe is shown) insisted that any race would break the Treaty of Salzburg, which called for a cease-fire to the Wacky Races for their senseless brutality. They also claim that if a race does take place, they would have no choice but to enter their completely self-driven prototype Lexus into the conflict. The Canadians and Chinese are also saying they would be forced to race, and no one yet has heard from Dick Dastardly or Muttley. Unless a miracle happens, this Saturday morning the world will witness the fist Wacky Races in nearly 50 years.
Shoppers: Wacky Races oh God! Wacky Races oh my God! Oh my God Wacky Races oh my God!
Gerald: Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!
Randy: I know! Are we watching at your house?!
Manager: That's it, everyone! We're out of cereal!
Manager: There's none left, don't you understand?!
Stephen: Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!
HC Driver 6: He HAS to do it, don't you see? He has people that are depending on him to raise as much money as possible. There are hundreds of people with handicaps now.
Timmy: Timmih...
HC Driver 7: But isn't that the problem? I mean, let's face it, it's not like he's able to keep the driver quality up. Anyone can have a Handicap now. I mean, even Matthew McConaughey is a Handicar driver now, for Chrit's sake!
Stuart: Jesus. It's begun.
Gerald: God help them all.
Randy: All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.
BBC Announcer: You are watching BBC World.
BBC Anchor: The vioent conflict over transport is underway, and it is even more senseless and vile than many remember. We return you now to our live coverage of.. the Wacky Races.
Announcer: As the Wacky Raccers roll down the roadway, we see that the taxicab in in the lead, with Handicar pulling up the rear.
Nathan: Slow down. I need Timmy to pick up the passenger before we do.
Elon Musk: But I though we wanted Handicar to lose the race!
Nathan: Hey Mimsy.
Announcer: The Canadian car overtakes the self-driving car. And now here comes the ZipCar, which is being driven by Matthew McConaughey.
Gerald: Wow.
Randy: Geez!
Stuart: God.
Randy: Did you see that?! Oh!
Timmy: Timmih!
Announcer: It's gonna be a close one!
Announcer: Oh no, Dick Dastardly is up to no-do-goodery again.
Gerald: Oh no! Ohh!
Randy: Oooo! Booom!
Mrs. McCormick: Ohohohh!
Elon Musk: Aaaaaah!
HC drivers: Timmy!
Matthew McConaughey: Sometimes you gotta go forward by goin' backward. Are we drivin' cars or are cars... drivin' us?
Timmy: Timmih!
Mimsy: D'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!
Announcer: Oh my, it appears that an explosion has opend up a wormhole with Matthew McConaughey inside.
Announcer: And there's the finish. It looks like Handicar has done it!
Nathan's Mom: All set for bed, honey?
Nathan: Yeah I like to sleep at nighttime.
Nathan: This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore.
Nathan's Mom: I'm sorry, I can't understand you honey. You're handicapped.
Nathan: What's to understand? I'm telling you I don't want to that stupid camp anymore!
Nathan's Mom: You want water? Is that what you want?
Nathan: No! I don't wanna go to camp!
Nathan's Dad: What's he saying?
Nathan's Mom: That he doesn't wanna go to summer camp this year, but I'll be damned if he's gonna ruin our Italy trip.
Nathan's Dad: Right.
Butters: Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
Butters: Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
Butters: I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
Cartman: No it isn't.
Butters: My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
Cartman: That's stupid.
Butters: You can see the momma bird fly in.
Cartman: I'm dying of boredom.
Butters: We took all kinds of video with his drone.
Cartman: Your dad has a fucking drone?
Butters: It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
Butters: My dad said it's not for spying on people.
Cartman: Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
Butters: Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
Stephen: Butters, are you home??
Cartman: Butters, is that you?
Butters: Yes, it's me.
Butters: Of course not!
Butters: What?! You said nobody would know!
Butters: Be careful! The powerlines!
Kenny: (Okay, try to get closer!)
Kenny: (Are you serious?!)
Cartman: Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
Kenny: (Stop taping!)
Butters: Jeeeeezz!
Cartman: This thing is recording, right?
Kenny: (Yeah.)
Butters: What do I do?!
Cartman: His dad sees you!
Cartman: Fly back to the house, stupid!
Thomas: You've got a problem, Stotch!
Stephen: What are you talkin' about?
Stephen: Hey now hold on. I am a drone hobby enthusiast. I would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct.
Thomas: Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now!
Stephen: I assure you, my drone is sitting in the garage. I'll show you.
Thomas: So, thuh so you flew it back here in time.
Stephen: I swear I didn't fly it.
Stephen: Butters?
Stephen: Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage?
Stephen: Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you.
Cartman: Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
Kenny: (Yeah, I know, dude.)
Cartman: Not a word, Kenny!
Stan: Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
Kyle: Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
Cartman: Hey you guys.
Cartman: You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
Kenny: (Dude! What the fuck!)
Stan: What?
Kenny: (Dude!)
Kyle: That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
Cartman: You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
Kyle: Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
Stan: How'd you get that on your phone?
Kyle: That's terrible!
Cartman: I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
Craig: For what?
Butters: What the heck are you doing?!
Cartman: Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.
Butters: When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
Cartman: Butters-
Butters: You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
Cartman: Butters. Butters.
Butters: Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
Butters: WHY?!
Cartman: Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
Butters: I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
Roger: Hi everyone. For those of you I don't know as well, my name is Roger Donovan, and un, just like you I'm pretty upset about what's going on in our neighborhood.
Thomas: How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that!
Laura Tucker: You know, it used to be called "natural". Completely shaving bald down there used to be the weird thing.
Thomas: It's okay honey, the-
Laura: But now, because I "choose" not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be,
Randy: Eeww.
Laura: I'm labelled as some kind of freaking monster!
Roger: And and and that's the point. I mean, we all have things about ourselves that are embarrassing, that that-
Laura: I'm not embarrassed about it! It's natural!
Stuart: It's a lot of natural.
Roger: Look, look, why we're here is because it's gonna take all of us, a neighborhood watch, to make sure that our community stays safe.
Mr. Garrison: Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?
Randy: It's simple.
Kyle: Are you happy now?!
Kyle: Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
Cartman: What does that have to do with me?
Kyle: See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
Cartman: Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
Cartman: You were what?!
Kyle: I was in the bathroom-
Cartman: You were spying on me?!
Kyle: No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
Cartman: But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
Kyle: How is that spying?!
Clerk: Hello, can I help you?
Clerk: You wanna return it?
Stephen: Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore.
Clerk: Uhh, noo, somebody has to control it.
Stephen: Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about.
Stephen: You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything.
Clerk: Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?
Thomas: You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal!
Officer 1: But they aren't illegal, Mr. Tucker.
Thomas: Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!
Sgt. Yates: Nono, none of us watched the video, but if we did, we could handle it. We're police officers. We see sickening things like that every day.
Officer 1: We understand the humiliation your wife has gone through, Mr. Tucker, but we don't-
Laura: I haven't been "humiliated", I've been wronged! We are here to ask for your help, now are you gonna help us or not?!
Officer 1: Well that'd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company.
Officer 2: Or perhaps a forest ranger?
Thomas: Help us with the drones spying on us!!
Sgt. Yates: All right, all right. We'll do everything we can.
Butters: Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
Cartman: Butters.
Butters: Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!
Cartman: Because, Butters-
Butters: Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
Butters: Why?!
Cartman: Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one."
Butters: That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
Sharon: You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.
Jimbo: What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!
Randy: I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
Anchor: While police claim they were only following standard protocol, the drone owners are banding together and holding a candlelight vigil.
Randy: Okay.
Stephen: I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them.
Randy: What might be?
Stephen: Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy??
Randy: ...Drones are spooky?
Stephen: If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby.
Reporter: You've become sort of a poster child for privacy and drone issues.
Laura: I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where police drones are monitoring Neighborhood Watch drones. I mean, where does it stop?
Laura: Have you ever seen pictures of naked women before 2005?! It's not that weird!
Thomas: It's okay, honey.
Stephen: Please do not adjust your televisions!
Reporter: What is that?
Cartman: Oh hey Butters. Sup?
Butters: Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
Cartman: Dude, what's the matter?
Butters: I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
Butters: I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
Cartman: Butters.
Butters: I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
Butters: I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
Cartman: Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
Butters: You do?
Cartman: Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
Butters: What?
Cartman: Your dad's drone.
Butters: NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
Cartman: Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
Butters: ...Okay.
Butters: If this doesn't work, we're dead.
Laura: They didn't!
Butters: Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
Butters: No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
Jimmy: Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.
Kyle: Oh. Really?
Jimmy: Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?
Kyle: What?
Butters: Congratulations, Kyle.
Kyle: This is stupid!
Terrance & Phillip: Yaaay!
Kyle: It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
Butters: We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
Cartman: I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
Kyle: Who makes this crap?
Minister: Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day!
Prince: Where is the roof on this thing?
Minister: Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies?
Phillip: What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!
Prince: Oh, I'm only the Prince of Canada! And this happens to be the Minister of Mobile Gaming.
Minister: We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.
Phillip: It's the dumbest game ever! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!
Prince: Ey! We know the game's not great, but who cares? It's free!
Prince: Uh oh, you think so?
Minister: I think they see through the charade, yes.
Minister: It's a simple cycle, a never-ending loop based on RPGs: Explore -> Collect -> Spend -> Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money.
Prince: It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun!
Stan: I'm sorry. I didn't realize I spent that much.
Randy: You didn't realize! What are "Canadian coins"?
Stan: You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
Randy: Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!
Stan: I'll pay you back for it, okay?!
Randy: How?!
Stan: I don't know, I'll figure it out! Jesus Christ!
Sharon: Wull whattaya mean?
Sharon: Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.
Minister: And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles: entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing cha-chings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-
Prince: So they'll forget they're spending money.
Minister: -and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.
Phillip: We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?
Terrance: What's this?
Prince: Your checks of course. For ten million American dollars. Each.
Terrance: So this is- Everyone is doing this?
Minister: Ehhhveryone is doing it.
Phillip: It's just the way things are going?
Minister: It's the way things are going!
Terrance: Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.
Stan: Ohhh hey guys.
Kyle: You... missed school today?
Stan: Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.
Kyle: Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
Stan: Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
Cartman: How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
Kyle: You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
Stan: You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
Cartman: Yes.
Stan: It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
Kyle: Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?
Kyle: Kenny, who told you about this game?
Kenny: (Jimmy.)
Kyle: Dude, what?!
Cartman: The?!
Kenny: (Fuck?!)
Boy: What do you mean?
Boy: Aw, I don't know.
Kyle: Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?
Jimmy: Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
Kyle: You need to stop recommending that app to people!
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Cartman: Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
Jimmy: I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.
Cartman: It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
Kyle: You just push it on other people?!
Jimmy: They pay me to!
Kyle: Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!
Prince: You've both done an amazing job. New hospitals, new neighborhoods, all funded by one freemium game.
Terrance: Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.
Minister: Oh. Ah what is the matter?
Prince: But just look at all the things we're getting to build. Soon, Canada will be as advanced and developed as Michigan.
Terrance: We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.
Phillip: Do you really think that would help?
Minister: Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time!
Randy: Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
Marvin: What are you talkin' about?
Stan: It's just...
Marvin: It's fun.
Stan: Yeah, it's fun.
Randy: It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
Marvin: Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!
Stan: Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
Kyle: But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
Jimmy: How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
Jimmy: It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.
Cartman: That makes sense.
Kyle: You're saying these games do this on purpose?!
Randy: What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!
Stan: I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
Randy: $26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!
Stan: One?
Randy: Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!
Stan: No, no, it's not.
Randy: You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!
Stan: I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
Jimmy: Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?
Jimmy: This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic.
Stan: It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
Jimmy: I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help.
Stan: How?
Kyle: Wuh, what's done?
Terrance: You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!
Prince: You what?
Minister: Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game.
Phillip: But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!
Terrance: You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!
Prince: Minister of mobile gaming, what's this all aboot?
Terrance: But then all our profits come from people with problems.
Minister: Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke.
Satan: You have summoned the Prince of Temptation! For what purpose?!
Stan: Whoa, shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
Stan: Okay.
Satan: But because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it, it's easy for them to overdo and have dopamine problems. You know, it's not fuckin' rocket science, this stuff.
Stan: So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
Satan: Fuck no! It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopamine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life.
Stan: So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
Satan: Yeah, that's pretty much what it means.
Stan: The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
Satan: Well who's not filling a fuckin' hole? Right? You know, I mean what kind of bullshit is that? So, let's talk about genetics now. You still have time?
Stan: Yeah, no, this is great.
Satan: Okay, let me get some visual aids. Gimme juuust a sec.
Minister: Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers.
Phillip: Oh God, he just doesn't stop!
Terrance: Who IS this guy?!
Terrance: Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!
Phillip: Beelzeboot!
Terrance: Oh no!
Prince: Oh, what have I done?!
Stan: I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
Satan: You know, they all do it, and it's kind of my deal, I have to put temptation out there too, so people have free will and all that shit. But ,you know, everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay.
Voice Notification: *Ding* Ey, buddy, where'd you go? Don't you want more Canadough?
Satan: What's this?
Satan: What, you just collect coins?
Announcer: How much money can you buy today?
Satan: No, see, if something's addictive because it's fun, that's one thing. But this is just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Wait a minute. Who put this out?
Stan: Ah, Canada?
Satan: Oh that son of a bitch! He's always doing this shit! I tell him, "temptation has to be nuanced!" but he goes and does this crap again! I'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick, kid. Is that alright?
NC 9 Reporter: Horror and sadness all over Canada tonight. When the Prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game, he apparently made a deal with the Canadian Devil.
Satan: Beelzeboot! Once again you lack any sense of nuance!
Phillip: Who the fuck is that?
Minister of Sports: Well of course, the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the Canadian Devil. But then again, he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years.
Canadian: Screw that, go Canada!
Kyle: Hey dude.
Stan: Hey.
Kyle: Y-you alright?
Cartman: Cool.
Stan: I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
Stan: We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
Stan: That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
Randy: It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.
Butters: I feel Stan! He looks totally real!
Clyde: What are you doing, Butters?
Butters: What what what?
Cartman: What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
Cartman: You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
Butters: I'm sorry!
Cartman: You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
Butters: Yeah.
Cartman: You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
Butters: Okay, I'm back in your room!
Cartman: Welcome back, dude.
Butters: Wow! That was cool!
Cartman: How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
Stan: Sound pretty typical to me.
Cartman: Thank you, Kyle.
Stan: Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
Cartman: Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
Cartman: Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
Butters: You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
Cartman: See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
Cartman: Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
Butters: Well, not a hundred percent...
Butters: Okay, subject is ready.
Butters: Interim status is go.
Butters: It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
Cartman: All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
Cartman: Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
Butters: Okay.
Butters: How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
Cartman: You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
Cartman: Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
Butters: Okay, I got it!
Butters: Already? Oh no!
Stephen: There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?!
Butters: Hello Dad! It's me, Butters!
Stephen: I know that! What do you-?
Stephen: Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh!
Linda: Butters, why?? Oh my God!
Butters: Huh, that was incredible!
Cartman: Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
Butters: Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now
Butters: Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
Cartman: Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
Butters: I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
Cartman: Wait, hang on Butters!
Butters: Take that, you dumb hooker!
Hooker: What you doin' motherfucker?!
Butters: I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
Cartman: Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
Dr. Carroll: You're very lucky, young man. You've got a couple of hairline fractures, but the knife missed your spleen by half an inch.
Butters: I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
Dr. Carroll: No, you actually got stabbed by a hooker. We've called your parents and they're on their way. Your dad wanted me to let you know that you're grounded more than you can possibly imagine.
Butters: Aw nuts!
Butters: I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
Butters: Ahhh!
Cartman: Are you okay?
Butters: Eric! Uh what are you doing here?
Butters: What?
Cartman: Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
Butters: Ah how do you know that?!
Nurse: Everything okay in here?
Butters: Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!
Cartman: Butters.
Butters: NO!
Kyle: Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
Steve: Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help.
Cartman: With what?
Steve: This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.
Steve: I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten.
Kyle: You should probably listen to him, dude.
Cartman: Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
Steve: The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend.
Cartman: Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.
Steve: I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.
Stephen: What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!
Butters: Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
Cartman: Are you fucking with me?!
Butters: ...What? What do you mean?
Cartman: Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
Butters: I don't know what you mean.
Cartman: Because if you are, it's not cool!
Butters: Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
Cartman: Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
Butters: Oh really? Oh, that's a relief.
Cartman: Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
Butters: Oh gosh!
Cartman: That's right!
Butters: OH GOSH!
Cartman: THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
Butters: Yeah.
Butters: Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!
Kyle: Again?
Butters: No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
Kyle: Uh huh.
Butters: I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
Kyle: Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
Butters: PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
Stephen: Butters?! Who is that?!
Kyle: You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
Kenny: (Yeah!)
Kyle: Get up, Cartman!
Stan: Kyle, maybe this is for real.
Kyle: Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
Kyle: Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
Steve: Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?
Kyle: Kyle.
Steve: Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?
Kyle: I don't care!
Steve: He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems.
Kyle: You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
Steve: Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.
Stan: "Fuck you" what?
Kyle: He said they're doing a Total Recall.
Stan: Oh fuck you!
Steve: All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?
Kyle: You haven't done anything yet!
Steve: But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns?
Kyle: We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
Kyle: Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
Kyle: Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
Cartman: Okay Kyle.
Kyle: Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
Cartman: Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
Kyle: Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
Kyle: I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
Cartman: And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
Kyle: Www-what do you mean?
Cartman: Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
Kyle: Fuck you!
Cartman: I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
Kyle: Don't... do that!
Cartman: Calm down.
Kyle: NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
Cartman: In virtual reality, yes you did.
Kyle: No. Then I came into this virtual space.
Cartman: You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
Best Buy Rep: Thanks for callin' Best Buy. How can I direct your call?
Kyle: Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
Cartman: Or if I did?
Kyle: Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?
Steve: Best Buy Customer Service, this is Steve.
Steve: Yes, hello. This call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future.
Cartman: Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
Linda: Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.
Stan: It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
Kyle: Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
Stan: No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
Kyle: Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
Stan: How do you know?
Cartman: Because... I'm a computer program.
Kyle: God damn it Cartman!
Cartman: I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
Kyle: He's lying.
Cartman: I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
Stan: What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
Stan: Butters called Customer Service first?
Steve: Have I answered all your questions in a satisfying and courteous manner?
Steve: Hello? My friend? My friend, I believe we are having some technical issues with our phone line. Please hang on, I'm going to call Customer Service.
Steve: Hello, Customer Service, this is Steve.
Steve: Hello, this is Steve with Customer Service.
Steve: Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service.
Steve: Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real.
Steve: ...Ohhh, nohhh, nonononononono.
Steve: My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop.
Steve: Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion?
Steve: What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!
Steve: Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service!
Steve: But you didn't answer any of my questions!
Steve: Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?
Stan: Butters.
Kyle: Why not?
Butters: Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
Kyle: Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
Butters: YES.
Stephen: What are your friends doing here?!
Butters: Huh I'm sorry Dad!
Steve: Hello, hello my friend, are you still there?
Stan: Yes, we're here.
Steve: Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call Customer Service. This is why you are having problems.
Stephen: You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!
Steve: That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters!
Steve: Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!
Stephen: Well you're getting it now!
Stephen: Oh my gosh! Linda!
Linda: What is it, Stephen?
Stephen: It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore.
Linda: He's not?
Stephen: You can go outside and play, son.
Stephen: No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over.
Stan: Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
Kyle: We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
Kyle: Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
Girl 1: The girls' volleyball team has a big game tonight and we're just asking for people to come cheer us on.
Girl 2: What's wrong with supporting girls' athletics?!
Kyle: But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
Girl 3: What fight?
Cartman: Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
Slaughterhouse: Alright, I'm going to play a fifth mana card... and then I'm going to attack with my Elderbeast- hold on. Wait. Hold on.
Kyle: Can Kenny block his Elderbeast?
Stan: Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
Cartman: This asshole needs to make a move already!
Referee: Quiet in the peanut gallery, please.
Slaughterhouse: I am attacking, but with a newly summoned Spark Ghast who has Trample. Four damage to your planeswalker.
Boys: Ohhhh!
Butters: Oh no! Kenny!
Stan: Shhh!
Stan: What's that?
Cartman: He's playing an enchantment.
Stan: This late?
Kyle: He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
Boys: Ohhhh!
Referee: Serendib Sorcerer unblocked. Winner: McCormick!
Boys: Yeeahhh!
Slaughterhouse: Nnoohhh!
Cartman: Dude, it was complete brutality!
Kyle: You've never seen anything so ruthless!
Cartman: At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
Wendy: Yeah, I heard the girls' volleyball team won by like 20 points.
Stan: Not that. Did you actually go to that?
Wendy: Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.
Stan: Pfft, whatever.
Cartman: Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
Janitor: Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit.
Stan: We're men.
Kyle: Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
Stan: Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?
Mr. Lu Kim: You purice?
Kenny: (What?)
Cartman: Dude, do we look like police?
Mr. Lu Kim: Okay, come on, come on, five dorrah, five dorrah each! Come on, five dorrah!
Announcer: Scrambles plays a Black Swamp mana card. Fluffy counters with a mana card of his own. And he plays a Fugitive Wizard!
Crowd: Ooooooo.
Announcer: More mana from Scrambles! And yes, that is Crippling Blight! Crippling Blight to the Fugitive Wizard! Creature now has -1 to strength and defense! More Mana from Fluffy. Now he'll attack with Fugitive Wizard, and there's an instant attack from Scrambles! That is Peel from Reality! Fugitive Wizard is literally torn apart from the battleground!
The boys: Whoa!
Announcer: The mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells! It's Mass Calcify against Into the Void!
Cartman: Dude, that was total carnage!
Stan: That was freakin' hardcore.
Cartman: Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
Stan: It was just decimation.
Kyle: It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
Cartman: We're going again on Friday, right?
Cartman: What's the matter Kenny?
Kenny: (I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)
Stan: What's mean about it?
Kenny: [mumbles]
Cartman: You feel bad for the roosters?
Kenny: (Yeah, I feel bad for the roosters.)
Stan: Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
Kyle: Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
Cartman: Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
Kenny: (No.)
Cartman: Huh? A little bit?
Kenny: (NO.)
Stan: Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
Kyle: Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
Det. Harris: Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us?
Stuart: What do you mean?
Det. Harris: Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it.
Stuart: What's cock Magic?
Det. Harris: Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play "Magic: the Gathering," and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?
Stuart: I don't go to any cock Magic fights!
Det. Harris: Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong, and anyone I find involved with this filth is goin' down!
Randy: Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!
Stan: Dad, it's not that big a deal.
Randy: It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.
Kyle: You were?
Stan: Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.
Voice: What is it?!
Cartman: Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play "Magic: The Gathering"?
Voice: Never heard of cock Magic, or roosters.
Kyle: Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.
Kyle: We don't... really know the difference.
Breeder: Well, your New Hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana. These here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards. And here you got your green mana necromancers. Lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue- or black-stacked decks.
Stan: Do you think they're happy?
Breeder: Do I think they're happy?
Stan: Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?
Cartman: Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
Breeder: Free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards.
Cartman: Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh, Kenny?
Breeder: That one's kind of young. I don't even know what kinda cards he prefers.
Kyle: Then he's perfect for us.
Cartman: What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?
Kyle: Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
Shelly: Mom, will you tell Dad to get out of the bathroom?! He's been in there for an hour!
Sharon: Randy?
Randy: All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.
Sharon: Ohhh, no no nononononono no.
Randy: Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.
Sharon: I know that's why you got kicked out of college.
Randy: Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.
Sharon: Stanley??
Announcer: Reuben casts Silklash Spider. Silklash Spider can block as if it had Flying! And now he casts Geistflame, dealing one damage to McNuggets.
Announcer: Quiet, please.
Someone: I think I'll bet on the next one.
Crowd: Whoa!
Stan: Yeah!
Cartman: All right, McNuggets!
Cartman: Thank you so very much.
Promoter: I've never seen a rooster throw down spells with such raw brutality. How would you like to move him up to the big time?
Kyle: You mean there's more to this?
Stan: Gee, thanks!
Cartman: You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
Woman: Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on.
Kindergarten boy: Yay, a show, a show!
Woman: Do you kids like magic?
Kindergartners: Yeah, yay!
Kindergarten boy: I hate you!
Stan: Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
Kyle: It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
Craig: Where was all this?
Cartman: We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
Kyle: Yeah, you gotta know people.
Butters: Dangit, I wish I knew people.
Coach: Thank you, Mr. Garrison. Listen uh, last night we had a pretty big game against Evergreen. The girls really hammered 'em, but once again we're a... little disappointed in the turnout.
Cartman: Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.
Stan: Dude, girls' volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
Jimmy: Fantastic girls' volleyball joke, Stan.
Coach: The girls wanted to say something, so we're now going to hear a few words from the captain of the girls' volleyball team.
Man: And then he uh, took his penis from behind our daughter's ear and uh, we uh, uh that's when we saw him with uh, the n-the three rings. and uh, his penis, he was pulling it through 'em somehow, uh.
Man: Well that's what I'm telling you. It was right here exce-except for the thing where he poured the milk into his penis; he did that over there.
Det. Harris: Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?
Woman: Decks??
Man: Who? There weren't any "decks."
Det. Harris: Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?
Det. Harris: Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!
Man: Nobody paid us anything! Now, there has been a crime here and you'd better do something about it!
Woman: Please! Don't take me away from my child!
Kyle: This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
Cartman: Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
Manager: Oh okay, come on, ten dorrah, ten dorrah.
Announcer 2: For the next round, it is Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds, versus Clucky.
Cartman: Who is that??
Cartman: Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
Kyle: McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
Cartman: McNuggets is scared, dude!
Stan: Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
Promoter: Alright, your rooster's up next, boys.
Kyle: Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
Promoter: He doesn't have a choice.
Cartman: This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
Promoter: What do you think all these people are here to see?
Cartman: Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
ESPN Announcer: You're watching ESPN Illegal, your source for bullfighting, dogfighting, and cock Magic.
Cartman: Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
Crowd: Whooaa.
Stan: What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
Cartman: Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
Kyle: He just had to shuffle it.
Cartman: Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an Overseer.
ESPN Host: A second Elvish Mystic now, and Gadnuk attacks with Merciful Pretender. McCormick sends Charging Rhino to the graveyard. He's desperate now. Not too much he can-OH, and he's just laid down Life's Legacy!
Crowd: Ooooohh...
ESPN Host: That was not expected! Gadnuk doesn't know what hit him! McCormick follows with Crackling Doom and Abzan Battle Priest!
Kyle: Holy shit, dude!
ESPN Host: Gadnuk tries to block with Living Totem but OH, there is Terra Stomper! This is absolute savagery! Frenzied Goblin has been sent to the graveyard and now there is no one to block Pearl Lake Ancient! My God, someone has to put a stop to this!
Promoter: Lousy cops! How did you find us?
Promoter: We didn't put those fliers out!
Cartman: Ah, dude, your dad's here.
Randy: Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?
Det. Harris: I'll volunteer.
Det. Harris: I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police.
Cartman: It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
Butters: Wow, the cops came?
Kyle: Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
Cartman: Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
Kenny: (Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)
Kyle: Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
Stan: Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
Kyle: Got what?
Stan: A way to finally do something good for other people.
Gerald: There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.
Gerald: It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
Kyle: Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
Kyle: Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
Ike: Maybe later, 'kay?
PewDiePie: There's lots of bullet! And I've gotta run! RUN FOR THE BUNKER! RUUUUN!
Kyle: Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
PewDiePie: All right, I hope that's enough.
Ike: Meh.
Kyle: Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
Butters: What's a PewDiePie do?
Kyle: Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
Cartman: He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
Kyle: Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
MJ Hologram: Hee hee!
Randy: Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!
Record Executive: Come on, this is a great lineup.
Randy: Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
Record Executive: I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig.
Randy: What is that supposed to mean?
Record Executive: I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada.
Randy: Yes, Freemium gaming.
Kyle: I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
Kenny: (Commentary?)
Kyle: I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
Kenny: (Commentary?)
Kyle: Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
Sharon: I don't know, Shelly.
Randy: Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
Shelly: She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!
Randy: And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
Shelly: That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything!
Randy: You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
Shelly: So can I go or not?!
Randy: If she means that much to you.
Randy: How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
Kyle: But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
Kyle: What do you think you're doing?!
Cartman: Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
Kyle: You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
Cartman: I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
Kyle: I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
Stan: What are you talking about?
Kyle: This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
Cartman: Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.
Kyle: Let's Plays?
Randy: Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
Record Executive: You're nervous, it's understandable.
Randy: No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
Record Executive: You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit.
Randy: Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
Iggy: Oh fuck you, Lorde! You think you're so much better than everyone!
Randy: No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
Iggy: That's easy for you to say because YOU don't have a nice body! Is that why you're so high and mighty, Lorde?! Because you're jealous of this booty?!
Randy: Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.
Iggy: 'Cause let's face it! You got legs that look like a horse!
Iggy: You're an Internet bullshit artist, Lorde!
Stan: Hey, what's up?
Kyle: You're not gonna believe this.
Stan: Oh no, what now?
Stan: Yeah?
PewDiePie: I'm going "Dun dun dadadun dun dadadun."
Butters: Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
Kids: CartmanBrah!
Stan: Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
Stan: Grandpa?
Kid 1: Yeah Conner, we're supposed to respect our elders, remember?
Kid 2: It's best to just make old people think they matter.
Stan: Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
Stan: We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
PewDiePie: Oh my God I killed him!
Randy: They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
Nicki: Oh Lorde, you're such a purist.
Randy: Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.
Wendy: Hi everybody. I love you!
Audience: Thanks for loving me. I love you too.
Cartman: CartmaaanBrah!
Cartman: Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.
Wendy: And why do you think young people-?
Cartman: CartmaaanBrah!
Cartman: CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
MC: And now, give it up for the girl from New Zealand, LORDE!
MJ Hologram: Hee hee. Dah dadit dat ja!
Guard 1: Michael Jackson's hologram is on the loose!
Fan: Ogh! Lorde, ewww!
Stan: Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
Randy: I was told to!
Sharon: You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.
Kyle: It's dying. The living room is... dying.
Randy: Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?
Record Executive: What are you talking about? It's great! You're the most commented-on artist in the world right now! You're blowing up twitter and you're trending on CartmanBrah. #clitnubbin
Randy: Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-
Record Executive: It's not about the music, Lorde! It never was. It's about comments! And sister, you've got 'em!
Randy: This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
Passenger: Will you look at that? Everyone on their cell phones, nobody sayin' a word to each other. Call me a grandpa, but I still like commenting face to face with folks. You know what I mean, buddy?
MJ Hologram: Yes.
Passenger: You're headin' up to the mountains too, huh? Gonna do some skiin'?
MJ Hologram: No, I just need to... take care of some im-, important business.
Passenger: Oh, what kind of business? Oh are you a fisherman?
MJ Hologram: Yes. I mean, yes, that's all. I'm, I'm just gonna fish and hunt.
Passenger: Oh, you're a hunter? What do you prey upon?
Passenger: Well, you must have a favorite kind of prey?
MJ Hologram: Allegedly! Allegedly! That's ignorant!
Passenger: You know, excuse me for saying so, but you seem kind of... transparent.
MJ Hologram: ...That's ignorant. I'm just cold.
Passenger: I'm saying it must make it easier to sneak up on your prey.
MJ Hologram: Allegedly! I'm weary of this conversation! Can we please stop talking, please?! Ignorant!
Tech 2: Ah, we've lost any ability to track the hologram's location. Ih...it looks like it reprogrammed its guidance systems.
Record Executive: We paid a lot of money for that hologram. You'd better find a way to get it back!
Tech 3: Project Alpha?
Tech 4: Yes. That might be our only option.
Record Executive: What is Project Alpha?
Tech 4: The first hologram we ever created to appear on stage. It was a prototype. But perhaps the best thing to stop a hologram-
Tech 3: Is another hologram. Bring up Project Alpha!
Tech 2: Sir, are you sure that we wanna-?
Record Executive: What is that?
Tech 3: Tupac.
Tech 3: Godspeed, Tupac.
Kyle: I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
Stan: Tell me about it.
Kyle: You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
Cartman: Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
Kyle: Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
Cartman: Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
Record Executive: Sit down, Lorde.
Randy: I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
Randy: Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
Record Executive: On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about.
Randy: I'll do no such thing!
Randy: You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
Mr. Garrison: Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle.
Mr. Garrison: What the hell is that?
Kyle: It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
Mr. Garrison: What the hell?
Cartman: This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
Butters: It's true!
Cartman: Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
Butters: Heheyehah.
Kyle: There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
Kyle: Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!
Mr. Garrison: I don't- I don't even understand what's happening.
Kyle: THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
Mr. Mackey: Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office!
Cartman: What the hell did I do?
Principal Victoria: Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.
Cartman: Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
Principal Victoria: Eric, I am talking to YOU!
Cartman: Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
Randy: Sharon? Sharon!
Randy: They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!
Sharon: Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?
Randy: The hologram's in our bedroom?
Sharon: Yes!
Tupac's Hologram: I've gotta be leavin' now, Sharon. I would leave you my number but I'm just a hologram 'n shit.
Randy: You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!
Record Executive: It's a brave new world, starting much sooner than we thought. What we need is someone who truly gets the changing of the guard. We have an army of holograms poised to start the next chapter in American culture. How would you like to be in charge of it all?
Record Executive: Glad you feel that way. We have a lot to do together. We're about to take this to a whole new level.
Various adults: What? Fired?
Cartman: Sweet dude!
PC Principal: Alright, listen up. My name is PC Principal. I don't know about you, but frankly I'm sick and tired of how minority groups are marginalized in today's society. I'm here because this place is lost in a time warp! Students who still use the word "retarded"! A teacher who said women without wombs should get an AIDS test!
PC Principal: A chef "person of color" who the children had sing soul songs and who the children drove to kill himself!
Butters: No, he got brainwashed by a cult.
Butters: What??
PC Principal: Let me ask you this. We're in Colorado, right?! Where are the Hispanic kids?! Huh?! Where are the ethnic and racial minorities?!
Mr. Mackey: Well, we have Token; he's black.
Mr. Mackey: Wha- I got detention?
Tuong Lu Kim: Ohhhh I hate-a Mongorians!
Kyle: You know what? I think it's good. Let's face it: this is long overdue.
Kenny: (Really?)
Butters: But the thing is, Eric isn't even fightin' it. It's like he's all sad and scared.
Kyle: Good! He should be sad and scared! These things do matter and I already feel better to be at a school where we can start to have a dialogue and talk about this stuff.
Gerald: Uhm, hi, I'm Gerald, Kyle Broflovski's father.
PC Principal: Have a seat. I've been talking with your child, and we're gonna be giving him two weeks' detention.
Gerald: Wh-wh-what did he say?
Gerald: PC Principal, I, I'm sure Kyle was just referring to Bruce Jenner as a person, and not trying to say anything against-
PC Principal: You got a fuckin' problem bro?!
Gerald: No...
PC Principal: 'Cause it's not Bruce fuckin' Jenner! It's Caitlyn, and she's a fuckin' stunning woman! Or maybe you're the one teaching him to demean women in the first place! HUH?! What's up?! What's fuckin' up, bro?
Gerald: Look, maybe we can all just ta-
Randy: I mean, who the hell does this guy think he is? Some college kid's gonna come in and tell us our ways are old?
Stuart: Yeah. And, you can't bully our kids like that.
Gerald: Kyle's already got two weeks of detention.
Stephen: Huh for what?!
Stephen: Oh, Caitlyn Jenner. she's a hero. She is stunning and brave.
Stuart: Stunning. She is absolutely beautiful, and an inspiration.
Ryan: Yup!
Randy: Yup, that's right.
Gerald: Well what the hell were you guys talki-
Ryan: we've gotta be careful, Gerald. This is a college bar.
PC Bro 1: Somebody here have a problem with Caitlyn Jenner?
Ryan: No.
PC Bro 1: No? 'Cause she's a stunning, beautiful woman, and if you wanna call her anything else I'm ready to fuckin' throw down!
Stuart: No no, we're totally fine with it.
PC Bro 1: Sweet. You're PC bro?
PC Bro 2: Yeah, Arizona State.
PC Bro 1: Sweet, bro. I'm PC UMass.
Stephen: No! Caitlyn Jenner is the bravest woman in America.
PC Bro 2: Nice, dude. You PC?
PC Bro 2: Yeah, you wanna make fun of me?!
PC Bro 1: Who the hell are you?!
PC Principal: I'm PC Principal.
PC Bro 2: Oh nice. We're all PC too.
PC Principal: No way! There's more PC bros here?
PC Bro 4: Yeah dude, Ohio State.
PC Principal: Sweet, bros. Texas A&M. Bro, I had no idea there were like-minded individuals in this town that defended social minorities. We should all hang out.
PC Bro 1: We should totally hang out.
PC Bro 4: We should all get a house together and unite our tolerant views.
PC Bro 1: Fuckin' do it, dude!
PC Bro 4: Fuck yeah!
Friend: Well how long d'you think this will last?
Kyle: Uhhh, hey Cartman. Uhwaht's goin' on? Aren't you going to ah, you know, go do something about this new principal?
Cartman: I've already got four days of detention. I don't want anymore. I'm gonna start following the rules.
Stan: But, this isn't you, Cartman.
Kyle: Yeah, where is the Eric Cartman we know? The Eric Cartman we know breaks the rules. And he gets away with it. Just like his hero! Come on, who's your hero, Cartman?!
Stan: Right! And what does Tom Brady do after breaking the rules?
Cartman: Deny and subvert.
Stan: Yeah!
Butters: Yeah, what? Well what would Tom Brady say if he got caught shoplifting.
Cartman: Everybody shoplifts. Why are you coming down on me?
Butters: Yeah!
Cartman: A perfect storm of hypocrisy that everyone in the country has to deal with for months on end.
Boys: Yeah!
Cartman: I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say "You're not giving me four day of detention! You're only giving me one!"
Boys: Yeah!
Boys: Yeah!
Cartman: Oh, PC Principal, how are you today?
PC Principal: What are you doing in the faculty bathroom?
Cartman: You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I'm not going to accept four days of detention and... you're going t'apologize publicly for being so strict to me and my friends at school.
PC Principal: What the fuck are you talking about?
PC Principal: What did you just say?
Cartman: You mean about keeping your dick out?
Cartman: Oh-kay. Look, you don't want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so you?
Cartman: Oh God!
Randy: Can I speak with PC Principal please?
PC Bro 5: Oh yeah. We got another one, guys!
PC Bro 6: All right. Bring him in, bro!
PC Principal: All right pledgies, we're excited. You wanna try and be PC. We hope you've got what it takes to join the most socially active group in America.
PC Bros: Weoooh!
PC Principal: You know, there's still some people out there that say "What does being PC really mean?" Well, I'll tell you what it means. It means you love nothin' more than beer, workin' out, and that feelin' you get when you rhetorically defend a marginalized community from systems of oppression.
PC Bros: Wooo! Yeah! Dude, let's go! Woowooo! Yeah!
PC Bros: Wooohooo!
PC Bros: Wooohooo! let's go! Yeah!
Sharon: You got home pretty late last night. Six AM?
Randy: I've joined a social awareness group. It's a coalition that discourages the use of ... words that have negative or offensive connotations... to grant respect to people who are victims of unfair stereotypes.
Sharon: You got in at Six and now you're missing work.
Sharon: Hm... And do they have booze at these meetings?
Randy: Uhhhh... They serve refreshments, yes.
Stan: Cartman?
Butters: What do we do now?
Cartman: There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admit I did something wrong, take my punishment, and move on. I'm not Tom Brady.
Kyle: Dude, if we all tell the police what the principal did, he'll be fired!
Stan: Yeah.
Cartman: No way.
Kyle: Why?
Cartman: Because PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it's time for us to grow up.
Kyle: No, you're a bigot.
Cartman: If I can face my prejudice, why can't you? We're two privileged, straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with.
Kyle: Come on, fat-ass.
Cartman: No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let's start a new chapter.
Kyle: So you're never gonna call me a dirty Jew again?
Cartman: No. I'm going to call you... my friend.
Cartman: I... guess we never realized how bad he really was.
Pledges: Wooohoo! Yeah!
PC Principal: Now it's time for the final test. So what you're gonna have to do, to prove you belong with PC, is go out there, and check someone's privilege.
Pledge 1: Finally!
Pledge 2: Yes!
Randy: I'm sorry, I don't know what that is.
PC Principal: Topher, can you explain "check your privilege" please.
Randy: You want me to shame Brett Favre?
Commissioner Cartman: You broke the rules!
Cartman Brady: Fuck you, "I broke the rules"! YOU're breaking the rules!
Commissioner Cartman: Fuck you, you broke the rules!
Cartman Brady: You broke the rules, how you found out I broke the rules!
Coach Cartman: Yeah, you broke the rules!
Commissioner Cartman: I'm the commissioner! I can break the rules 'cause you guys broke the rules before! I didn't bust you enough!
Coach, Brady: Just because you didn't bust us enough for breakin' the rules, that doesn't mean you can break the rules bustin' us now!
Commissioner Cartman: Fuck both you guys! I can do whatever I want! I'm breakin' the rules!
Cartman Brady: Fuck you, I'm Tom Brady!
Commissioner Cartman: Fuck you, I'm the commissioner! I'll make up new rules!
Coach, Brady: Fuck your rules!
Commissioner Cartman: Fuck you guys, always fucking rules!
Cartman: Ack! Butters!
Butters: I'm here, Eric.
Cartman: Oh Butters, I've lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS?
Butters: Yes Eric.
Cartman: I'm never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman.
Kyle: Will you please tell your dad to leave me alone?
Stan: Dude, what happened?
Stan: That's my best friend, Dad! Stop shaming him because you want to fit in!
Kyle: I didn't even say she wasn't a hero! I just said she isn't a hero to me! I didn't like Bruce Jenner as a person when he was on the Kardashians, and I don't suddenly like him now!
A passing bro: Weoo-weoo-weoo-weooh!
Stan: Her.
Kyle: HER, yes!
Cartman: Who?
Butters: Well, well now they've made Kyle their main target.
Butters: Eric, what are you doing?
Cartman: I don't have a choice. I have to take these PC people out.
Butters: Oh, but I thought you agreed with them.
Butters: Well ohhh-kay!
PC Bro 5: And you!
PC Bros: Woowoo! Yeah! Yeah! Fuck yeah!
Pregnant Mexican Women: Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
PC Bro 2: Dude, what is this, bro?!
PC Bro 6: I don't know, bro!
Stephen: What in the world is going on??
Townsman: Wooo.
PC Principal: I gotta hand it to you, Marsh. You really checked that little boy's privilege. Using those Syrian refugees was genius, bro.
PC Bro 4: Yeah. I would have never thought to use offensive imagery and outrageous stereotypes to provoke someone to open their eyes.
Randy: So I'm PC now?
Stan: So I guess PC Principal is here to stay, huh?
Kyle: It just seems to me like we all lost in this, and that the only person who won was you.
Mr. Garrison: You see?? There! This is why it's happening! Everyone's preachin' openness and acceptance, and so now millions of goddamned immigrants are comin' over the border and nobody seems to care!
Mr. Adler: Well what are you gonna do? In today's world it's like you can't even say anything negative about illegal immigrants.
Canadian 1: Alright guy!
Canadian 2: Hey buddih!
Canadian 3: Hey buddih!
PC Principal: You really think you can refer to an undocumented immigrant as a "Canuck"?!
Mr. Garrsion: PC Principal, they got up in the middle of my lecture and started playing music!
Mr. Garrsion: Thuh, they don't even speak English!
PC Principal: Then you need to be teaching in both languages from now on! Mackey, sign the faculty up for Canadian-language night classes!
Mr. Garrsion: What?!
PC Principal: You're on thin ice, Garrison! Get in line or you'll be out of a job, bro!
Clyde: Ugh, so weird!
Token: There's just so many of them.
Cartman: You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy.
Token: Whattaya mean?
Cartman: Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in?
Cartman: And he's sitting right here.
Kyle: You really think just my speech brought on a wave of illegal immigration?!
Stan: You did kind of go overboard, dude.
Stan: It's just... I know you like giving speeches and stuff, but not everything is black and white.
Clyde: Yeah, I mean, it's fine you wanna go preach about Caitlyn Jenner, but you can't just make blanket statements about letting anyone do whatever they want.
Kyle: I didn't even want to give that speech!
Butters: Uhn-un.
Cartman: Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now.
Kyle: Uh I'm not responsible for this! Illegal immigration has been happening forever.
Cartman: But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew.
Kyle: You guys, immigrants, either legal or illegal, are always gonna find ways to cross into richer countries if they're not living-
Cartman: Yeah, I'm out.
Stan: So not cool. How does someone just rip on us like that?
Kyle: I can't believe Jimmy Fallon hates us. Jimmy Fallon loves everything. Why would he slam our whole town?
Cartman: Because apparently he doesn't care that his jokes are at the expense of actual people.
Butters: Wull do you think it's true? Do you think we're really bigoted country bumpkins?
Kenny: (Well fuck you, dude!)
Stan: I just hope somebody finds a way to fix this.
Mayor McDaniels: I've called you all here because South Park has an image problem. Thanks to Mr. Garrison we are now being referred to as the shit-heads of America. One of our more politically sensitive citizens has proposed an idea for this crisis and I'd like you to hear him out.
Stephen: We couldn't get a Whole Foods to open here.
Randy: And why not?! Huh?! We all just don't believe we could get a Whole Foods! Because we don't believe in ourselves!
Fr. Maxi: Where could it even go?!
Randy: Mayor?
Randy: Lots of cities are dong this. The area south of Downtown South Park has always been the ugly eyesore of this town. But now, SoDoSoPa... is going to bring in the fresh new vibrancy that Whole Foods can't ignore.
Kenny: (Hey Dad, there's these fucking people outside.)
Mayor McDaniels: So you think you'll keep all the existing structures?
Architect: I do. It's part of what gives a revitalized area like this its charm that the hipsters like.
Stuart: Hey, what are you people doing?!
Randy: We're gentrifying. It'sall good.
Johnson: We realize that when a rejuvenation like this takes place, the lower-income residents fear they'll be priced out of the area.
Stuart: What lower-income residents?! Me?! I work hard and provide for my family just fine!
Randy: Stuart, come on. Your house sucks.
Stuart: Fuck you! If you people wanna turn somethin' into a vibrant arts district, then do it to Randy's house!
Randy: My house is nice.
Aide: Mr. McCormick, you will be living in the most vibrant part of the entire town. SoDoSoPa is the future of South Park.
Johnson: There will be amazing food and incredible shops right at your doorstep.
Mayor McDaniels: And we want to assure the lower-income families that we are going to take the time to do this right.
Waiter: Alright guys, welcome to Steed. Do we have any allergies?
Det. Harris: Wow, can you believe this place?
Diner: Uh huh.
Mike: At what?
Tuong Lu Kim: SoDoSoPa? What the hell is a SoDoSoPa?
Tuong Lu Kim: What the fuuuck!
Karen: Mommy, can we go eat outside?
Mom: No, we can't go eat outside.
Johnson: What's he gonna say?
Johnson: He's coming!
Gerald: Mornin' Randy!
Randy: Mornin' Ger! Just another day in paradise, huh?
Randy: Hi. Two of us. please?
Greeter: Yeah, sorry guys. we got about a thirty minute wait.
Randy: Whoa, what'd you say to him?
Gerald: I just... told him who I am.
Randy: Who are you?
Waiter: Alright guys, welcome to (vernacular)
Gerald: Thanks, uh, did they mention to you that I am a Yelper?
Waiter: Yes, we've been alerted. Sir.
PC Principal: So these guys made fun of your weight and made you feel ashamed?
PC Principal: Alright, why don't you take me back to what happened?
Mr. Mackey: Well, Eric, maybe you shouldn't have put a picture of you in your underwear up on social media.
Mr. Mackey: N-No, PC Principal.
Cashier: Okay. sir, looks like your total is $37.83.
Cashier: Sorry?
Randy: Look, I give money to charity a lot, okay?
Cashier: Oh, sure you do.
Randy: I do. I just don't want to every time I shop for food.
Randy: Look, if I give money every time I went grocery-shopping, I would be-!
Kyle: Uh huh.
PC Principal: Well Eric and I have been talking, and we've decided it's probably best for him to get off of social media.
Kyle: Yeah probably.
PC Principal: So what we're looking for is a student volunteer. Somebody who can put the things Eric wants up on the Internet for him and also filter through all the comments and make it more of a safe space for him.
Kyle: Wait, what?
Kyle: You want me to run Cartman's Twitter and Yelp account and only give him the good comments?
PC Principal: That's right.
Kyle: No.
PC Principal: Kyle, you know what body-shaming is, right? How much it can hurt someone's life? All you have to do is check out all the comments, type out just the positive ones, and give that to Eric on paper.
PC Principal: Okay Kyle, well maybe you'd like two weeks' detention instead.
PC Principal: You sure about that?
Kyle: Yeah, I'll take the detention.
Wendy: Is this a joke?
Cartman: I'm not a joke!
PC Principal: Nothing funny about this, Testaburger! This is a big problem in our country!
Wendy: I'm not doing it.
Cartman: I wanted someone smart and hard-working!
Butters: Do I gotta?
PC Principal: You want detention?
Butters: Well if I get detention, uh I'll get grounded.
PC Principal: Then you start today! Butters, it's your job to make sure Eric has a safe space.
Female Shopper: Oh ahhh, I'm sorry.
Randy: Oh no, my, my fault.
Female Shopper: Isn't it great having a Whole Foods?
Cashier: Aand how are you today, sir?
Cashier: Oh no problem sir, they've updated the system so it's a lot more streamlined now. Find everything you need today?
Randy: Yeah, thanks.
Cashier: There we go, and that's... Okay, and would you like to give a dollar to hungry kids today?
Randy: This is not streamlined!
Cashier: Yes, she's a hungry one. You've gotta pull hard.
Randy: Dammit! The sandwich isn't coming out.
Cartman: There you are. You have my social media comments?
Butters: It's a pretty brutal job sifting through all that darkness.
PC Principal: Hey, Seagal! Listen, that was a really amazing talk you gave to the kids.
Butters: But PC Principal, I really don't have time.
PC Principal: This man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness! I think you can give him a little of your time!
Butters: Yes sir...
Cashier: Find everything you needed today?
Randy: Yes.
Cashier: Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98. Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?
Randy: Yes, I would like to give a dollar.
Randy: Yes, I will.
Butters: Yech. Oh God that's terrible. Jesus.
Butters: Whoa my God. Wugh.
Demi Lovato: Yeah. And the coolest thing? Ever since I started using this service, all of my followers are actually way more stoked on me. So cool, right?
Cartman: Butters!
Butters: Well I'm sorry, Eric. I, I guess it slipped through the cracks. I'm overloaded with all the new people.
Cartman: Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed!
Cartman: Butters, I want this fixed by tonight, you got that!
Randy: This is a place where hope is scarce. These people are hungry. Little Jojo here might not eat today. But does that mean it's okay for cashiers to ask us for money while we're in the checkout line? It isn't right, and it isn't fair. Just $2 a day adds up to 62 goddamned dollars a month if you go to Whole Foods as much as I do. Nobody should have to feel the shame, the humiliation, of being asked to add money onto their grocery bill. Help now. Let's make grocery stores a #SAFESPACE for all. Together, we can make a difference.
PC Principal: You know, if there's one thing I really respect, it's plus-sized models who challenge the idea of what makes a woman beautiful. These ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign for plus-sized lingerie, and we wanna make sure they're protected from any harassing comments.
PC Principal: Hey, they're gonna putting themselves out there, and all I'm asking you to do is go through their social media and delete the two or three comments that are mean.
Butters: PC Principal, ah I don't think you quite realize how much negative stuff I have to sift through.
PC Principal: I know it's a lot, but I just really need you to help these plus-sized models. And Vin Diesel.
Butters: Vin Diesel too??
PC Principal: Look bro! You've done an amazing job with Eric Cartman. You have really turned his life around, and other people deserve... to be as happy as he is.
Girls: Awwww.
Tweek: What?
Girls: Awwww.
Craig: Dude, what the fuck?
Wendy: But yaoi can branch out to other things as well.
Cartman: Uh oh.
Stan: I just don't get it. I mean, Tweek and Craig aren't gay. Right?
Butters: Well, but then why would Asian girls draw them like that?
Jimmy: Yeah, what is this yaoi thing all about? I am so c-c-c-confused.
Stan: And if it can happen to Tweek and Craig... could it happen to any of us?
Craig: What? Well what did she say?
Girl 3: I don't know, that was Korean. I'm Japanese.
Tweek: Everyone thinks I'm gay! What if my parents find out! Huh!
PC Principal: Alright guys, I know there have been a lot of rumors flyin' around. Just wanted to check in, see if you have any questions for me.
Craig: Why are the Asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay?
PC Principal: What's wrong with being gay? Nothin' wrong with that.
Craig: But we aren't! I'm not!
Tweek: I'm not either!
PC Principal: That is completely irrelevant! Okay? What matters, and the reason I brought you in here, is that you understand affirmative consent.
Tweek: What's that?
PC Principal: IF there is a romantic relationship here, you have to make sure your partner is comfortable with any sexual exploration.
Tweek: Gah!
PC Principal: Now, in a gay relationship it gets a little trickier, but you still have to follow some guidelines, alright?
Craig: But I'm not gay!
PC Principal: I don't care about that, bro! Tweek, if, and I'm only saying if, at some point you wanted to touch Craig's penis, you can't just go grabbin' for it. Alright? You need to say something like "Craig, is it alright with you if I touch your penis?" Okay? Let's try it out.
Tweek: NO!
PC Principal: You want two weeks' detention instead?! This shit's important!
Tweek: Craig, can I touch your penis?
Craig: No you may not!
PC Principal: Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Now Craig, what would you say if you wanted to take a gander at Tweek's asshole?
Sharon: Randy, you should have a talk with Stan.
Randy: For what?
Sharon: I guess something happened at school today involving two of Stan's friends,.. being gay?
Randy: What?
Sharon: Yeah. Stan seems really perplexed.
Sharon: Go talk to him, Randy, and be delicate.
Stan: I'm confused, Dad. There was this thing at school.
Randy: Well, guess what? You've got a really progressive PC dad who knows all about this stuff, okay? Go ahead, ask me anything.
Stan: I just don't understand how it's decided.
Randy: Ah, well, you see, it's a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.
Stan: No, I mean like, what makes the Asians decide who they're gonna make gay?
Stan: So you've heard of yaoi?
Gerald: Oh hey, Thomas! Hey, we heard about Craig. We think it's just terrific.
Richard: Tweek's out of coffee, honey.
Richard: Tweek, is there anything you want to talk to us about?
Tweek: No.
Richard: We thought you were just a spaz, but to know that you've got so much going on inside.
Mom: We're so proud of you, Tweek.
Tweek: AAaaagh!
Cartman: I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude?
Cupid Me: But if love is love, then it takes form in all shapes and sizes. Teehee.
Cartman: I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along.
Cupid Me: Really? Can I?
Cartman: Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you.
Cartman: Did you do it, Cupid-Me?
Cupid Me: I hit him with my love arrow, and then I peed in his mouth just for fun.
Cupid Me: I thought you might like that.
Cartman: Yeah, dude. You're hilarious.
Cupid Me: And do you think I'm cute, too? 'Cause I think you're kind of cute.
Cartman: Yep. School tomorrow should be really interesting.
Stan: And so my dad talked to me about it.
Kyle: Yeah?
Stan: And my dad said that Asians have always done this, and they, like, do make people gay.
Kyle: What?
Craig: I told you to stay a hundred yards from me!
Tweek: You'd better not fuckin' push me again, man!
PC Principal: Hello Mr. Tucker. I need to inform you that your son was in an altercation at school today.
Craig: Goddammit!
PC Principal: Something to be expected in relationships. Apparently there were no affirmative consent issues, as your son knows the right way to play with another boy's penis.
PC Principal: There's not gonna be any disciplinary action since they are gay. We wanna be supportive, so we're just gonna send them on home with some money, alright? Alright, you have a nice day.
Thomas: Money?
Xi Jinping: What?
Xi Jinping: That-a come from-a Japan.
Randy: Uh huh, yes, that of course I do already know about homosexuality.
Liane: Who are they from, hon?
Cartman: Someone who needs a real talking to.
Cartman: Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing.
Cupid Me: Teeheehee. Aw, come on, let's be like Tweek and Craig. Everyone thinks they're kewl.
Cartman: You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys.
Cupid Me: But I'm so attracted to you.
Richard: Well, hello Craig. Honey, it's Craig.
Mom: Awww, hi Craig.
Craig: Is Tweek home?
Craig: No thank you, I just want to see Tweek.
Mom: Awww.
Craig: Tweek, calm down. We have to put a stop to this.
Tweek: There's no stopping it! The whole world wants me to be something I'm not!
Craig: Me too, dude! But there's something we can do.
Tweek: What??
Craig: We have to come out and say we're gay.
Tweek: What?! Are you insane?! The way everyone-!
Craig: Wait. Wait! Because if we're gay, we can break up. And if we break up, no more pictures! We just have to stage a fake breakup in front of the Asian girls.
Tweek: Like acting? No man, that is way too much pressure! I'll fail-
Craig: You can do it, Tweek! You're capable of more than you think.
Tweek: Agh. I'm a terrible actor.
Craig: You just follow my lead, and try and make it believable, okay?
Tweek: Oh gah-okay. Oh God!
Thomas: What did I do wrong, huh? Everyone's so damned happy, but... but why did this have to happen to my son?! What did I do to make my son like this?
Randy: Hey, hey, whoa, you didn't do anything.
Thomas: Oh what? You know about this?
Randy: Yeah, let me handle this guys, I'm PC. Look Thomas, you need to understand that being gay isn't a decision. You know, a lot of people think that Asians decide who's gay and who's not. But it isn't all Asians, it's just specifically the Japanese, okay?
Thomas: What?
Skeeter: Hey, you sure know a lot about this.
Randy: Yes I do.
Kyle: No dude, I looked it up. Yaoi is just an art style for girls by girls because they like fictionalizing two guys in a relationship.
Stan: But why?
Kyle: I don't know. But the point is, there's nothing about it that means Tweek and Craig are actually gay, at all.
Tweek: We don't belong together? What suddenly changed, Craig?
Craig: It's just that people are different. That's all.
Craig: What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Tweek: I went through your phone when we went out last night, Craig! I saw your texts to Michael about hooking up with him!
Craig: Wait, uh, that's, that's not what happened.
Tweek: Oh, it's not?
Tweek: Oh, don't use that lame shit on me, man! You don't wanna feel bad, so you try and tell me what I want?
Craig: Wait, don't make me out to be the bad guy here.
Tweek: Agh-I'm going too far?! What is wrong with you?
Craig: This wasn't part of the plan!
Tweek: Well guess what, Craig! Love doesn't follow a plan!
Butters: Yeah!
Craig: Dude, seriously? Seriously?
Cupid Me: I'm just here to pick up on guys. Why? are you jealous?
Cartman: No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now.
Cupid Me: Oh, now you need me, huh? Fuck you, dude.
Cartman: Fuck you.
Man 1: What is that kid doing here?
Man 2: He's just kind of talking to himself.
Cartman: The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help.
Cupid Me: Well, I guess I could try now, in return for just... one date?
Cupid Me: Then I guess I'm not interested.
Cartman: Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together.
Cupid Me: Teeheehee! Teeheeheeheehee!
Bartender: Hey kid, what do you think you're doing here?
Tweek: Hi, is Craig here, sir?
Mrs. Tucker: Thomas!
Tweek: Hey dude.
Craig: What do you want?
Tweek: I thought when we broke up everything would get better. I was thinking maybe, we should say we're back together.
Craig: Dude, I'm not gay and neither are you!
Tweek: What does that have to do with anything?
Craig: You think you can just pull that shit you pulled at school, saying I step on people and use them?! And I'll just take you back?
Tweek: You said to make it seem real.
Craig: Not that real! Now everyone thinks I'm a manipulative cheater! I'll never get any chicks!
Craig: I can't be something because everyone wants me to be. I have to be myself. You'll just have to go be gay with someone else.
Thomas: Then again, he's my son no matter what. I can't just shut down on him.
Cartman: It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me.
Cartman: Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight!
Cupid Me: Teeheeheehee!
Liane: Awww.
Boy: AAAAAH!
PC Principal: Waaaah!
Mayor McDaniels: This town is outraged, Officer Barbrady! People are tired of the police not being held accountable for their actions!
Barbrady: Mayor, I didn't know if there was a gunman, or a bomb-
Mayor McDaniels: You shot an unarmed six year old Latino child!
Barbrady: I'm sorry.
Mayor McDaniels: You're fired.
Barbrady: No, Mayor, please. This is all I know. I used to be the only policeman in this town, remember? Bob, ah I used to chase away the sixth graders for you.
Barbrady: Where should I go?
Johnson: You should have thought of that before you shot a Mexican!
Mayor McDaniels: Latino-American.
Mayor McDaniels: You should go away. You don't belong anywhere in a town as progressive as this one.
Stuart: 'Cause this is my fuckin' house!
Stuart: Yeah, we've got a bunch of drunk-addict vagrants trespassing on our yard and we need assistance.
Stuart: What are you talkin' about? There's homeless people here and they're scarin' my kids! You need to come do somethin' about this!
Sgt. Yates: I see. And are any of these homeless people of a minority persuasion?
Stuart: Why does that matter?
Mitch: No thank you.
Sgt. Yates: Yeah, no, I think we're good. In fact, we're thinking of maybe turning the whole department into a hula school. Whattaya think?
Mrs. McCormick: What are they doing?
Stuart: They're not coming!
Mrs. McCormick: But they have to! Karen brought in one of their syringes, for Christ's sake!
Stuart: Well that's just too bad! The cops won't come, so there's nobody to scare the homeless away!
Stan: Who?
Cartman: Kenny and Token.
Kyle: What?
Cartman: Kenny and Token, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me.
Kyle: You're lying.
Cartman: No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away.
Kyle: How is that gay?
Cartman: It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!
Stan: You and Kenny built all this?
Clyde: You guys should come and check it out.
Clyde: It's pretty cool, dude. People are scared of us.
Cartman: That's pretty cool.
Gerald: Well the way I heard it was that the girl in the school wasn't even doing anything. Just talking too loud. And someone ends up getting shot.
Skeeter: Hey! What you want?
Barkley: It's okay, I'm off duty. Just came in for a nice pinot.
Patron: Yeah? Well go somewhere else, copper! CtPaTown is for people who care about each other!
Skeeter: We don't take kindly to folks who impose their authority on the underprivileged!
Barkley: Now look, not all cops are racist trigger-happy assholes.
Cartman: Totally dude, ninjas are sweet.
Token: Together we must strive to make our fortress super bad-ass and keep all intruders out! To that end, let us proceed to our training.
Kyle: You're talking to Kyle right now.
Cartman: Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters.
Kyle: You're the one who said ninjas were gay. Why do you wanna make this a problem?
Cartman: I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things.
Butters: Hey Eric, you wanna try sparring with me?
Butters: OOF. Ow. Ahem.
Anchor: The town of South Park is holding a large protest tonight outside of their police department. The townspeople say the protest is meant to begin a dialog about the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens they are supposed to protect.
Anchor: Are your children being lured into terrorist organizations? A shocking report shows that some kids in the town of South Park are swearing loyalty to a murderous regime.
Cartman: Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool.
Reporter: And what about this way of life has attracted you?
Butters: We're just cool 'cause we're tough, and we fight and stuff, and we can ah-.
Cartman: Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad!
Stan: Then why'd you say it was gay before?
Cartman: Oh my God! I never said it was gay!
Token: Wait, he said this was gay?
Stan: I'm Stan.
Anchor: No doubt the growing number of kids swearing loyalty to ISIS could be problematic for the progressive town.
Homeless Man 5: Spare a dollar?
Mayor McDaniels: Why are they all suddenly coming here?
Mayor McDaniels: When a town like ours has a homeless problem it must look at the root of what's causing it.
Randy: What?
Stephen: They're these troubled kids who've turned their backs on America! They've taken over SoDoSoPa, forced all the homeless out!
Gerald: Why would kids in our town wanna be a part of that?
Stephen: They're just bad kids! Rotten on the inside! Probably with shitty parents!
Ryan: Son, I've always tried to be a fair dad. Eh I I don't want to meh make you angry, but... why?
Jimmy: Well Dad, I just re-really like being a part of something. I feel like it's character-building and it's lots of fun.
Ryan: Fun? But what do you... believe in?
Randy: Okay, we've just gotta be really apologetic and tell them we didn't mean it, okay?
Gerald: Jeez, this is so embarrassing.
Mayor McDaniels: What if they won't help us with the homeless?
Stephen: Officers, there's kids in town who have joined ISIS. We don't know who they are, but they-.
Sgt. Yates: What? What's that, you say?
Mayor McDaniels: The town is in danger, alright? We don't know what these kids are capable of.
Sgt. Yates: Jeez, I'm sorry. We've got to work on our koholo kaloa, and get the lomi lomi chicken ready for the big ho'olao le'ao, which leaves us... oh, not enough time to deal with ISIS.
Randy: Alright, look. There's homeless people all over our gentrified food and arts district. If you don't stop thewe twisted kids, then-
Sgt. Yates: Hey, who was it that said "fuck the police"? Was that Ice Cube? Tupac? Oh, right, that was you guys! Sorry, but I guess you'll have to find somebody else to do all the difficult dirty shit you don't want to do yourselves. I've gotta be ready for the luau. I might even kiss a dude.
Cartman: So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember?
Butters: Yeah?
Cartman: And we said Kenny and Token were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember?
Butters: Uh I thought you said it first.
Cartman: No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Butters.
Token: You guys! You guys!
Stan: What?
Token: Actual Ninjas. Wanna talk to us.
Clyde: What?
Token: Kenny and I both just got the same email from people overseas.
Cartman: Whoa, dude.
Stan: How's they found out who we were?
Cartman: They're fuckin' ninjas, dude!
ISIS Leader: So, you are the brave children who have committed to our cause. We are aware of what you are doing and we are very impressed.
Stan: Cool. Thanks, dude.
ISIS Leader: What you are doing is very important and we would like to help you however we can. We are going to be wiring you some money.
Butters: Whoa, cool! Why, this is the greatest thing ever you guys!
Cartman: Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something?
ISIS Leader: Of course.
ISIS Leader: Extremely.
Barbrady: Uh, who?
Barbrady: What do you want?
Johnson: How would you like to be a policeman again?
Barbrady: I'm no good as a policeman. I'm a bumbling old fool.
Stephen: That is not true! Who said that? Look, Barbrady, the fact is, the town needs you.
Barbrady: They need me? To do what?
Barbrady: No! Shoot kids? I don't wanna shoot kids!
Randy: Shh! Shhh! Shhhh! These are really bad kids. Terrorists. This is totally different from before.
Barbrady: No. No. Are any of them minorities?
Aide: A couple of them, we think. Yeah.
Barbrady: Noo no no no no no no no no!
Randy: You're the only cop this town needs, Barbrady. Go shoot those kids.
Stan: That's Clyde.
Cartman: ...and I am Token. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage.
Barbrady: Oh Jesus. ISIS, oh God.
Marvin: This chicken tastes like shit. What'd you do to it?
Randy: Okay, okay Dad, it's not organic chicken. I'm not comfortable shopping at Whole Foods with all the homeless people there. But don't worry. That's all about to change. Soon we'll all have CtPaTown to enjoy again. Where's Stan?
Sharon: He's playing ninjas over at Kenny's house.
Sharon: Yeah.
Randy: You mean, SoDoSoPa?
Sharon: Uh huh.
Sharon: Randy, what are you doing?
Cartman: Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, but Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle.
Kyle: Nobody ever gave a shit, you fat pig!
Token: All those in favor of Cartman being kicked out of our ninja club?
Ninjas: Hai!
Cartman: No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please!
Kyle: Oh shit!
Stan: Cool. Don't.
Barbrady: I understand you feeling angry at this town. I'm getting pretty angry too. But we can't give up on it. Please boys, don't make it end violently.
David: Aaa!
Barbrady: Aaahaahaaawe!
Mayor McDaniels: What were you thinking?! Boys innocently playing ninja and you pull your gun on them?
Aide: David Rodriguez was lucky to live!
Barbrady: Everybody told me they were terrorists.
Mayor McDaniels: We thought they were. But if it turns out they aren't, as a policeman, you have to figure that out!
Barbrady: But, you said you needed me to kill some kids.
Randy: Oh, he's gonna lay this on us now. I said kill some kids, but I said it as a question, remember? I said "Kill some kids?"
Mayor McDaniels: I'm sorry, but we just can't cover your ass on this one. There's going to be an investigation and ... you just don't have what it takes to be a policeman in today's times.
Barkley: Let's go people, you can't stay here. You are being relocated.
Homeless Man 6: Hey, you can't kick us out of here, man.
Sgt. Yates: Oh no? I'm a cop.
Randy: Thank you, officers.
Sgt. Yates: We've got a deal, right?
Homeless Man 6: Aaaah!
Homeless Man 7: Ninjas? Oh, that's so gay.
Cartman: I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin' gay but you didn't wanna listen, nooo!
Agent: Officer Barbrady.
Barbrady: Yes?
Agent: We've been watching you. And what we see is a man who truly wants to protect his town.
Barbrady: You do?
Agent: You've been in this town longer than almost anyone. Have you noticed... changes... lately?
Barbrady: Yeah, a lot of changes.
Agent: They aren't a coincidence, officer. They are all part of a plan to take down your beloved town and everyone in it.
Barbrady: What?
PC Principal: [off-screen, but you can hear him slamming lockers shut] Who was it?! Somebody's about to get their asses kicked! [a bunch of kids run screen right.] When I find out who did this!
Butters: [runs into view towards the other fourth graders] PC Principal is on the warpath! Run for your lives! [turns right and runs down another hallway]
Stan: [to Kyle] Again?
Kyle: Oh Jesus, now what?
PC Principal: [appears at screen left and walks towards the fourth graders.] Who was it?! Huh?! Somebody better fess up RIGHT NOW! I'm gonna find out who did this! [Kyle closes his locker and begins to walk away. PC Principal notices] Broflovski! Was it you?
Kyle: Was what me, sir?
PC Principal: I just saw a copy of the school newspaper in which a student used the word "retarded" to refer to our cafeteria lunch policy! The word "retarded" does not belong in our school!! Who is in charge of the school paper?! 'Cause I'm about to break their fuckin' legs!
Stan: Aaah, he's in charge of the school paper. [points to his right. PC Principal turns left and faces... Jimmy. PC Principal is speechless.] You gonna break his legs, PC Principal?
PC Principal: Alright, uhh, I I guess we haven't formally met before. Uhh, the reason I need to talk with you, Jason, is because of a very important-
Jimmy: It's Jimmy, actually. My name is Jimmy, PC Principal.
PC Principal: Alright, Jim. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about the use of the R word in your school paper. [holds up the paper, on which the subject on the front page is chocolate milk being removed from the school menu, "LEAVE OUR CHOCOLATE MILK ALONE"] You see, the 'R' word is very bad.
Jimmy: Says who?
PC Principal: Says me. Right? Now I know a thing or two about the rights of people with disabilities. When you use the 'R' word to describe the school's lunch policy, it can hurt people's hearts. [places his hand over his heart] Can you understand that at all?
Jimmy: That was an op-ed piece in the paper written by a first grader who found the school lunch policy to be ridiculous, and he thought "r-retarded" to be the best word to describe it. As the editor of the paper, I didn't think it was right to censor the words the student used.
PC Principal: ...Okay, well, from now on I'm gonna need to approve the school paper before you hand it out, okay?
Jimmy: No.
PC Principal: What'd you say?
Jimmy: You're new here, so you don't understand how seriously I take my job as editor of the school paper. I don't allow ads, and I don't allow anything that might t-t-t-taint the truth behind what people are thinking. i don't want people to be afraid of words if it stops them from having a dialog.
PC Principal: Look, I don't wanna get angry, okay?
Jimmy: Why? Are you uncomfortable around people with disabilities? That's okay. Lot's of people are.
PC Principal: No, I'm not. I am very not uncomfortable. Alright, look, unless I can approve your paper, it is not being distributed on campus, you got that?
Jimmy: I can't hand out the school paper in school?
PC Principal: Not unless it is approved by me. Do you understand?
Jimmy: Yep, got it.
Jimmy: Don't forget to read the school paper! Now delivered directly to your door. [Wendy is the first student to get the paper. Clyde is next] Super School News! [Jimmy smiles and rides away. His seventh delivery is to Butters' house. Stephen opens the door and the paper smacks him in the face. He manages to catch it though. Jimmy goes on to the PC Delta house and tosses a paper there too. A few PC Bros are lounging around outside]
PC Bro 10: What is that, bro? [the front door opens and PC Principal walks out.]
PC Principal: [picks up the paper, takes off the rubber band, and reads it. The headline there: "PC PRINCIPAL'S 'RETARDED' POLICY, by Jimmy Valmer]
Jimmy: [holds up his right middle finger at him] S-s-s-suck my dick, PC Principal! [rides away. PC Principal's bros look at the principal.]
PC Principal: Who does this kid think he is?! Challenging me?! I said one micro-aggression to him, okay?! One little micro-aggression! But that doesn't mean I have an unconscious bias towards people with disabilities!
PC Bro 4: No way, bro! That's wack!
PC Principal: But why would a person with a disability not see that what I'm trying to do is actually protect them?
PC Bro 9: Sometimes victims of oppression are so marginalized that they begin to sympathize with their oppressors.
PC Bro 11: Yeah bro.
PC Principal: You're right. This kid just needs to be shown he's being an Uncle Abel. I can always count on my PC frat brothers to have my back. Let's go PC!
PC Bros: PC Woo!
Stephen: Wow. [turns the page] Wow, this is so great. Have you ever read the elementary school newspaper, Linda? There's no ads, no sponsored content, no links to click on. Just news stories about what's happening. [looks at her] Did you know that the police in ShiTpaTown beat up homeless to clear them out? [returns to the paper] Do you know long it's been since I was able to just sit back and read the news? I got so used to getting news off the Internet. But I feel like I'm always trying to chase the news somehow. [sets the paper down on his laps] It's like I'm in a black void, trying to reach the news story. [he's shown doing this in a vacuum] But then the next thing I know I'm reading an ad for Geico. So I click out of that and try to read the news story but it's not a news story. It's a slide show. [for Android phones] And I'm looking at the worst celebrity plastic surgery jobs ever. So of course I want to see the next line of plastic surgery gone wrong, so I hit the arrow, but then the arrow wasn't the arrow for the next line, it was to take me to an ad for face cream. Haugh! I wanted to get a news story, but I'm reading about face cream and I try to click out of it, but the ad is following me, and it's following me all over the screen! Nooo! So I click on the close button, but it wasn't a close button, it was another slide show, and I just want to know what's happening in the Middle East, but instead, I'm looking at the top ten scariest movies of all time, and that's not the arrow for the next line, it's another ad! Aaagh! [comes back to reality] But this... this is just news. And I don't get lost in all the bullshit. Linda? [sees that she's mesmerized and shakes her] Linda!
PC Principal: Alright Jim, I know you've been trying to wrap your head around some of the social issues he discussed yesterday. I'm sure you're feeling confused and a little unsure of yourself.
Jimmy: I'm not confused at all, actually, PC Principal.
PC Principal: Okay, well, no, you are confused-
Jimmy: I'm pretty sure that you're the one, but go ahead.
PC Principal: Because you don't grasp the severity of this, and that's why I brought in another young person with disabilities to share his feelings. Thanks for comin' in to talk to us, Nathan.
Nathan: [takes a seat next to Jimmy] I like apples and bananas.
PC Principal: Me too, bro, me too. Nathan, could you tell Jimmy how you feel when people uwe the word "retarded"?
Nathan: It hurts my feelings because I feel bad.
Jimmy: Are you serious right now?
PC Principal: You feel bad, right. You feel like that's a no-no word, right?
Nathan: That word makes my heart piss its pants.
PC Principal: Okay, wow, that's pretty heavy. Pretty heavy, huh Jim?
Jimmy: Do you want to ask him what he means by that, or are you just pandering because you're uncomfortable around disabled people?
PC Principal: I am not uncomfortable! I simply care about a horrible, outdated word that is exclusive, ignores individuality, and equates intellectual disa-bility with being... [begins to stammer] And it's, and it's, s-spot, I need a spotter, spot me, somebody spot me bro!
Topher: [steps in and puts PC Principal's train of thought back on track] And it's, it's part of a derogatory hate speech which fosters isolation and loneliness and being part of a voice to stop the R word is not only right, but extremely important!
Nathan: I'm afraid of bears. [Jimmy is decidedly not convinced of PC Principal's sincerity]
Jimmy: Hey Nathan, hold up. What were you doing in there?
Nathan: What do you mean, Jimmy? Are you ma-ad?
Jimmy: Come on Nathan, you and I both know you use the word "retarded" 400 times a day.
Nathan: Oh Jimmy. So righteous, aren't you? So blind to everything that's going on.
Jimmy: What are you talking about?
Nathan: Do you really think all the changes happening to this town are just coincidence? This goes so much deeper than you can possibly imagine, Jim. Everyone's about to learn the truth. And then... There's a war coming. A war, Jim. And I'm just gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it.
Mr. Mackey: Come on, boys, let's get back to class.
Nathan: I like to smell trees! [walks off.]
Anchor Tom: An elementary school newspaper is making big waves as more and more people say No to news on the Internet.
Rancher: I read super school news 'cause it don't try and fool me and it's news reports aren't paid for by ad companies.
Gerald: We just feel like this is actual news, and instead of clicking on links, we're reading stories.
Stephen: I had to get away from the ads. I felt like the ads were... evolving somehow. They started knowing what I liked. What I was afraid of. I tried ad blockers, but it seemed like every time I tried to block the ads, they just got smarter. I'm never going back from Super School News.
Anchor Tom: The young editor of the paper claims that since most people now watch news reports on the Internet, they're easily distracted or even fooled by ads, [the camera pulls back to show the news report as a video on Randy's smartphone] which are finding more and more clever ways to disguise them-
Randy: Oooo, brutal celebrity mugshots. [also on the screen, "SoDoSoPa in disrepair" Randy taps on the link, which leads to a slide show of celebrity mugshots which contains 40 images. He taps on the right arrow, and it leads to the first weight-loss ad instead of the next mugshot] O-hoh it got me. Ad got me, Sharon.
Announcer: We now return live to the 2015 Presidential Debate.
Moderator: Our next question is for you, Mrs. Clinton. Many voters believe that Syrian refugees should not be allowed into our country for security reasons. What do you think?
Hillary: Keeping our country save has become more and more difficult, but I believe there are several things that we can-
Garrison: No! You shut the hell up! You've got a dumpy butt, and seven chins. Syrian refugees are all terrorists!
Hillary: I know that our government needs to take a harder look at all-
Garrison: Yeah well, it's pretty hard to look at you! We can all agree on that!
Caitlyn: [interrupts for a bit] She looks like a donkey took a shit in her face. [goes backstage again]
Garrison: Yeh-hah, good one Caitlyn. See, what I know is that there's only one way to deal with Syrian refugees, and that is...
Everyone: Fuck them all to death!
Garrison: Thank you!! [after the debate Garrison and Caitlyn head backstage laughing] That was hilarious when you called her a pizza face.
Caitlyn: It's like a Papa John's pimple party.
Garrison: Oh, that was classic, Caitlyn. You're the best running mate ever.
Principal Victoria: [the first thing you see is her big hair] Hello, Mr. Garrison.
Garrison: Oh My God... Principal Victoria?
Principal Victoria: [now using a came, walks forward] Congratulations on the polls. We need to talk. [Dramatic music ends Act 1.]
PC Bro 12: [on the sidewalk just left of the entrance] Celebrate diversity! Woooo!
PC Bro 13: [on the balcony, right side] GO PC!
PC Principal: [walks in with a mic] Alright everyone, listen up. [the music shuts off and everyone falls silent] Tonight is a very special night for the PCs. We're honored to be throwing this event for people with disabilities. [several disabled students are present, like Jimmy, Timmy, Francis, Lenora] I for one am sick of how these amazing kids are marginalized in today's society. but tonight is about learning and healing. So let's get to it! PC! [drops the mic. The other bros echo him and cheer]
PC Bro 7: Hey guys, I'm Brad. I'm PC Arizona State.
Jimmy: Nice to meet you, Brad. Where do you guys-?
Brad: Excuse me a second. [walks over to a pretty brunette and her friend] Hello, ladies. Thanks for coming to our event.
Ladies: Hi.
Brad: We're just tired with the way people with disabilities get treated. Can I get you some alcohol?
PC Bro 14: Yah, you know, it just bugs me when people refer to persons with disabilities as "handicapped." When I hear that word I wanna fuckin' punch them in the fuckin' face.
Blonde: That's so cool of you, wow.
PC Bro 14: Yeah. [Jimmy walks into view, but no one notices him] To me marginalizing persons with disabilities by asking them what their handicap is, is a micro-aggression no better than asking a person of color if they went to college.
Blonde: Wow, you're really progressive.
PC Bro 14: No other way to be. So uh, listen. I think you're really pretty and interesting, and I'd kinda like to take you upstairs and totally crush your pussy. Would that be acceptable to you?
Blonde: [looks away, giggling] Oh well, I, I guess it would.
PC Bro 14: No, I'm sorry, I need affirmative consent. I'll need you to say "Yes, you may take me upstairs and crush my pussy at this time." [PC Bros and their lady guests pair up and dance, some of them making out. Brad dances with two women and makes out with the redhead. Jimmy is the only disabled person left in the room]
PC Bros: PC Bros, PC. Yeah!
PC Principal: McKinsey, you got consent forms?
McKinsey: Oh yeah, right here bro. [hands him the forms through the door]
PC Principal: Rise and shine guys. If you scored last night, I'll need your consent forms. [the other bros hand him their forms through their doors] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you-whoa! Barker, did you perform cunnilingus? There's a different release form, bro.
PC Bro 15: Yup. Uh, so-, sorry. It's right here.
PC Principal: Nice.
PC Bro 11: [voice only, behind him] Bro! Aw, dude, bro!
PC Principal: What, bro?
PC Bro 11: Dude, I scored with this female and after consenting to putting her mouth on my penis, she wanted me to walk her home.
PC Principal: Yeah?
PC Bro 11: And when I got to her house she had me meet her father who is Filipino, so I asked him if he could tell me about their cultural and social dynamic to being a Filipino-American.
PC Principal: Naturally.
PC Bro 11: So he said some stuff, and then the newspaper landed on his doorstep, 'cause I guess her dad subscribes to the school newspaper, and he picked it up and I saw the headline said this!
PC Principal: [grabs the paper and reads it] What the fuck is this bro?
PC Bro 11: Bro, that little kid wrote that our tolerant views and fight for social justice is just a way for us to crush puss!
PC Principal: That's not true!!
PC Bro 11: I know, bro!! We're being totally victimized!
PC Principal: That little fucker, dude!
Representative: Hello. You're the boy responsible for the South Park Super School News?
Jimmy: That's right.
Representative: We would like to give you $26 million. [Jimmy seems interested, so he lets him in. They sit down at the coffee table and the rep opens his briefcase, taking out documents] Contracts, and the first check. We'd love to be in business with you.
Jimmy: What is this for?
Representative: I represent an organization called Geico. It's an insurance company. We think Super School News would be a great way for us to reach new customers.
Jimmy: Sorry Charlie, but I don't allow ads in my newspaper.
Representative: We've heard all about that, so we thought you could just do some ...news stories about car insurance. Just state the facts, because the truth is, everyone can save by switching to Geico.
Jimmy: That's called "sponsored content." I know the difference between the news and ads. Do you think I'm stupid?
Representative: Everyone's doing it, Jim. You're sort of the last holdout. $26 million just to write some news stories that get people thinking about their insurance coverage?
Jimmy: Sth-sth-sth, stick it up your ass!
Representative: Hm. [puts the documents back in the briefcase...] Well, they said you'd be tough. [...and brings out a gun and arms it] Do you really think you can stop ads?
Jimmy: Yes.
Representative: You can try to block ads, but they get smarter. The more we ty to shut them out, the more clever they get. There's a war coming, kid, and I'm gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it. [a bullet shoots through his head from behind. killing him where he stands. Blood begins oozing out his mouth. He falls to his knees and then onto the floor. Barbrady is in the doorway, his knees weak, but his gun drawn]
Jimmy: Officer Barbrady?
Barbrady: Come with me if you want to live! [he runs back to is car, but Jimmy is confused. Barbrady returns] Come on! Come with me if you want to live! I'm serious! [runs back to his car]
Sharon: Do you want to explain to me what pussy crushing is?!
Randy: What?
Sharon: Your little meetings you go to at night to discuss social justice?! [drops the paper on the table. Randy picks it up and reads the front page] It's just a way to pick up on young women?!
Randy: Sh-sharon, most of the guys in my PC club are right out of college, alright? You know how college kids are. Who wrote this?
Sharon: I don't want you going over there anymore!
Randy: [stands up] I don't cheat on you, Sharon! I'm happy. Look at what's happened to our town. We have ShiTpaTown, boutique restaurants and artisan shops. We have a fucking Whole Foods, and that was all me! Diverse people are moving here, and everyone is being aware of how they talk. This is paradise, Sharon!
Sharon: [gets in his face] Is it? [turns right and walks out towards the living room, then turns around] All I know is that you've changed. Every since you joined this PC thing you just bully people. And wait for people to say anything improper so you can jump down their throats for whatever words he or she used.
Randy: He or she is an agenderphobic microagressions, Sharon. You are a bigot. [Sharon turns around and walks away again while he resumes reading the paper.]
Agent: The average human can no longer tell the difference between the news and an ad. You seem to have some mental ability that allows you to know the difference.
Jimmy: Does this have to do with me calling the school principal a pussy crusher?
Agent: The PC People are simply being manipulated, unwittingly setting the table for the new enemy of humanity.
Jimmy: You mean ISIS or ninjas?
Agent: [stands up] Something... much worse. [turns away] Have you ever felt like an ad had... intelligence? That it somehow knew what you wanted, even before you knew you wanted it? [] What if I were to tell you that ads have become smarter than us? And now they're manipulating everything we do?
Jimmy: I'd say that sounds pretty retarded.
Agent: [walks to Jimmy's end of the table, then veers away] It was our own fault. Mankind became tired of ads, so we kept inventing ways to make things ad-free. We even created ad blockers. That's when the ads had to adapt. They had to disguise themselves as news in order to survive.
Jimmy: Sponsored content?
Agent: If you really can tell the difference, then you could be the key to saving our species, Jimmy. We'd like to run a test on you.
Computer: Sponsored Content, Test 17-B, Ready. Begin. [a series of news articles pop up onscreen, and Jimmy has to discern whether it's news or advertisement. "Doctor Found Dead In Apartment"]
Jimmy: That's the news. ["Dental Problems on the Rise"] That's an ad. ["Missile Test Lights Up The Sky"] That's the news. ["Vermont Experiencing Heavy Snow"] That's an ad. [a different agent clicks through the articles for him] That's the news. That's an ad. That's an ad. That's the new-oh no, that's an ad for act food. My bad.
Agent: Jesus Christ, he's off the charts.
Agent 2: Increase the intensity.
Jimmy: ["Man Arrested for Murder of Entire Household"] That's the news ["Price of Precious Metal Rises Due To War"] That's an ad. News. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. News. News. Ad. Ad. Slideshow. Ad. [The test ends and the computers wind down. Jimmy's chair is pulled away from the main computer on a track.]
Agent: That's a perfect score. You are a very special child, Jimmy.
Jimmy: I prefer "handicapped," actually.
Agent: We have another child here who's special too. [a metal security shield comes down to reveal a window, and a girl on the other side of the window.] Do you know... Leslie? [she notices him on the other side of the glass and looks at him]
PC Principal: [steps outside to survey the work] Alright, that's good. Everyone get inside. Everything past here is safe space. [the bros start going inside] No reporters, no harassment. We are gonna figure this shit out. [PC Principal closes the door behind himself. Once inside, everyone is sitting around in silence. PC Principal finally speaks] All I know is that I don't speak up for minorities so that I can crush pussy.
PC Bro 16: Me neither, dude. I want social justice and now I'm being made fun of.
PC Bro 17: Yeah bro. They're taking our incredibly tolerant views and distorting them.
PC Principal: PC people are under attack. That's what this is.
PC Bro 18: Hey yeah. Bro! We're the victims now. Like, we're being marginalized. Like... that makes us pretty cool.
Topher: Yeah, I bet now we can get a lot more puss.
PC Principal: No, Topher! It's not about puss, alright?! The fuck is wrong with you?! We're being labeled as meatheads who just wanna crush puss by an intolerant newspaper!
PC Bro 16: [now standing] Yeah, fuck that dude, bro!
PC Principal: Yeah. And like, if you're gonna belittle and make fun of PC people like that, then who's to say he won't do it to other marginalized groups like us? I mean, this kid could be the next Hitler. And if you guys could stop Hitler, what would you do?
PC Bro 9: I'd rip that dude apart and then go home and totally smash some puss, bro.
Other Bros: Hell yeah!
PC Principal: Nooo!
Leslie: You look familiar. Don't you go to my school?
Jimmy: Yes. Uh, I'm Jimmy. Editor In Chief of Super School News. [smiles]
Leslie: I'm Leslie.
Jimmy: N, nice to finally talk to you.
Leslie: Did they bring you in and give you a bunch of tests too?
Jimmy: Yes, they did. Do you know who "they" are?
Leslie: I think they're ex-newsmen. You know, the men in suits who used to be in charge of the news.
Jimmy: I thought I recognized them.
Leslie: They told me I was special. Are you special too?
Jimmy: I prefer "handicapped."
Leslie: [makes a weird noise] I like that.
Mr. Garrison: Principal Victoria, if everything you've said is true, then, why doesn't anyone know about it?
Principal Victoria: There are people who know. But they have to stay very hidden.
Mr. Garrison: I'm just havin' a hard time swallowing all this. And between me and this one over here, we can swallow just about anything.
Caitlyn: [scoffs] Oh God, you're such an asshole.
Principal Victoria: Mr. Garrison, I wasn't fired. I was replaced. This goes much higher than anyone knows.
PC Principal: I came to this town really thinking I could make a difference. I've been called a bigot towards persons with disabilities. I've been called... [stops for an instant] Pussy-crusher, because of the behavior of a very few individuals in my PC frat. [Nathan is shown] Jimmy Valmer is off the school newspaper. I want you to take over.
Nathan: Ooooh boy!
PC Principal: And I will be reviewing your paper to make sure nobody is ever attacked the way I was again.
Nathan: I think this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
PC Principal: Jimmy almost made me lose confidence, but I know who I am. I know what I am!
PC Bro 11: [voice only] Dude! Bro! [runs into the principal's office] Oh, bro, I went online to read a news story about immigrants being discriminated against.
PC Principal: Yeah?
PC Bro 11: Well, and so I clicked on the headline and it turned out to be an ad for Reddi-Wip. so then I clicked on the button to make it go away, but then it was a link to another ad, and when i tried to cancel that, another window came up, and it was this! [approaches the desk and shows
PC Principal: Dude! [stands up and whips his glasses off] What the fuck, bro?
PC Bro 11: What does this mean, dude?
PC Principal: Bro! What the fuck, bro?!
Leslie: Do you like our school, Jimmy.
Jimmy: Uh yes, Leslie, I like our school very much.
Leslie: I like our school too. I like the kids who go there.
Jimmy: Uh huh. I'm starting to wonder something about you, Leslie.
Leslie: I'm starting to wonder about you. I mean, you seem like a nice kid, but... don't you feel like you could be happier? [this sets off an alarm in him]
Jimmy: Holy. Shit.
Leslie: What?
Jimmy: Can you excuse me for a moment?
Leslie: Okay. [Jimmy leaves the room for a moment]
Agent: Well Jimmy? What do you think?
Jimmy: [looks over his shoulder] Does she know she's an ad?
Agent 3: He can spot them.
Jimmy: Does she know she's an ad?!
PC Principal: [softly, looking truly victimized now] What the hell is going on, bro?!
PC Bro 19: [stops by and checks in on him] Bro?
PC Principal: Bro, what the hell is going on, bro?
Principal Victoria: If we're going back, remember: we don't know who we can trust.
Mr. Garrison: If they wanna mess with my town, I'll fuck every last one of them! Let's do this!
Caitlyn: Buckle up, buckaroos! [revs up the motor and drives off running over several people]
Mrs. Nelson: Alright guys, now let's go back and talk about infinitives [begins writing the lesson on that subject]. Remember, those are verbs combined with the work "to."
Cartman: [yawns and whispers to Kyle] Oh, my fucking God...
Mrs. Nelson:: Now, usually an infinitive acts like a noun, as in "I want TO go out to eat" or [Cartman tugs on Kyle's pen, making him mess up, and smiles. Kyle pulls the pen away. Cartman pulls again] "I hope TO be chosen today."
Kyle: What?
Cartman: I'm so bored, dude.
Mrs. Nelson: Now usually, it isn't common to split TO and the verb, but sometimes you can, [Cartman pulls the pen out of Kyle's hand and throws it away],
Kyle: Knock it off!
Mrs. Nelson: as in-. Is there a problem, guys?
Kyle: Go get my pen, fatass
Cartman: I am not your slave, Kyle.
Kyle: Go get my pen!
Mr. Mackey: [over the PA system] Attention, students. Kyle Broflovski report to the Principal's office please?
Cartman: [laughs] PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle!
Mr. Mackey: Kyle Broflovski to the Principal's office please, m'kay?
Kyle: Goddammit! [leaves his seat]
Cartman: Have fun, dude.
Mr. Mackey: [looks up surprised] Oh, Kyle. [sits down on the chair and looks fearful] Uhh, uhh, thank you for coming.
Kyle: Where's PC Principal?
Mr. Mackey: I think he's finally lost it, Kyle. He and his PC buddies are on a hunger strike and, they're calling for people's resignations. Kyle, PC Principal had problems with Jimmy and with Leslie. And now they're missing. M'kay? Nobody knows where they are. That's what happens. You go against PC, and you just end up missing. M'kay?
Kyle: What are you talking about?
Mr. Mackey: PC Principal had issues with them. M'kay? And he had issues with you, Kyle. Whatever's goin' on, it's pretty damn scary.
Jimmy: For years, mankind has tried to rid the world of ads. For our ancestors, ads couldn't be avoided. But everyone knew what was an ad, and what wasn't. After many years, mankind invented cable. A way to p-pay for television so there would be no ads. But somehow, the ads still found a way. And so mankind invented TiVo. A way to skip past commercials. Finally, it appeared to be the end of ads. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads were stopped. Or so it seemed. With the rise of the Internet, suddenly the ads got an en- tirely new way to attack us. Popups. The top scientific minds were brought together to find a way to stop the ads, once and for all. They invented the ad blocker. Suddenly there were no ads on phones, on computers. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads adapted. They became s-smarter. They disguised themselves as news. All around the world people read news stories completely unaware that they were reading ads . And now, the ads have taken the next step in their evolution. They have taken human form. Ads are among us. They could be your friend, your g-gardener. The ads are trying to wipe us out. But the question is... how?
Randy: So, um, ahem, South Park kind of sucks now. You guys wanna bail? [everyone else but Grandpa are stunned at this and stop eating.]
Sharon: What?
Shelly: What are you talking about?
Randy: It's just, you know, it used to be nice and laid-back here, but now it's all [puts his palms forward] Uuuuhhh, you know? Like like now everybody's all Uuhh-uuhhh. Let's bail. You wanna bail, Stan?
Stan: No, I don't. [Randy lowers his head and looks at his food,]
Sharon: What's going on, Randy?
Randy: Nothing! I just... You know, we don't have to live here, we can live anywhere.
Sharon: Last month, all you could talk about was how great this town had become. What changed your mind?
Randy: [stops and looks away] ...We can't afford it. [Sharon's jaw drops]
Sharon: We can't afford it?
Randy: All these fancy new restaurants and shops and [sits on the edge of the bed] everyone wants to live here! A bowl of City beef costs ten bucks now, for Christ's sake. And there's nowhere to shop but stupid Whole Foods!
Sharon: [crosses her arms] Well, we'll just have to stop going to those places.
Randy: I had to take out a second mortgage on the house.
Sharon: You [uncrosses her arms] what?
Randy: [gets up, runs to her, and holds her shoulders] I had to, Sharon! It isn't my fault! It's the Man. Don't you see? The Man... is pricing us out of our own town.
Jimmy: [faces the newsmen] It's just my luck. I talk to a nice girl, seem to hit it off, and she turns out to just be an ad.
Tom: Well, that's what an ad does. She was designed to entice, and manipulate.
Jimmy: This is such a fantastic story for the school newspaper. Why don't we just run it so that everyone knows the truth?
Tom: Jimmy, we're newsmen, like you. For decades we used our soft buttery voices to inform the people about what's happening. Then we watched as our entire industry was taken over by the ads. [the newsman to his right lowers his head and looks at the table] Some of our colleagues were manipulated into doing the ads' bidding. The man who came to your house with a gun was one of them. Our own Kevin Jarvis has more.
Kevin: Thanks, Tom. Jimmy, the man who tried to kill you was Brian Boint, of WXNR, Fort Collins. When he saw there was no money in news anymore he sided with the ads, even though he knew it meant the destruction of our species. Back to you, Tom.
Tom: Thanks, Kevin. The only hope for the truth to get out there, Jimmy, is for you to see through this ad's deception and to find out what they're planning. Your Super School News was a threat to them. But unless you get this little bitch to talk, we may never know why.
Stan: Dude, Kyle. Will you look at this? [shows him the paper, which has a report on PC Principal sending Jimmy and Leslie on a Disney Cruise]
Kyle: "Principal Sends Two Favorite Students On A Disney Cruise. This week, students Jimmy Valmer and Leslie Meyers are being treated to an all-expenses-paid vacation for their outstanding school-" what the hell is this?
Stan: It doesn't make any sense, dude. PC Principal is using the school paper to cover something up.
Kyle: Yeah I... Ah I don't wanna get involved.
Stan: You don't wanna get involved? Dude, what's wrong with you?
Kyle: I've already learned you can't win against PC Principal. You should know of all people since he converted your dad.
Stan: What's that supposed to mean?
Butters: [runs up with Cartman] Fellas! We found out what happened to Jimmy! He got to go on a vacation for being an exemplary student.
Stan: That is not what happened! Something is very wrong here! We all have to stand up to PC Principal together!
Cartman: Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out?
Nathan: I like the school paper. I like to type with my hands. [the camera then shows Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Butters in the room watching Nathan.]
Kyle: Who told you that the principal sent Jimmy on a Disney Cruise?
Nathan: Uhhh. Uhhh. Uhhh, I don't remember.
Stan: You have quotes in here from Jimmy. Did you talk to him?
Nathan: Uhhh. Uhhh, I like the school paper.
Stan: [the boys look at each other] Come on, we'll get to the bottom of this. [they head out]
Nathan: [some seconds later] Did I do good, computer? [touches the screen] I think the sponsored content fooled them. I hope I made you happy. Can you see me, computer? Do you know what I'm thinking right now? [a porn popup windows appears] Ahh, thanks, computer.
Principal Victoria: We have to make sure nobody recognizes us. There's no telling who works for who. Here, Caitlyn, I got you this fake mustache to put on.
Caitlyn: I'm not putting on a mustache, I'll look silly.
Mr. Garrison: Oh, that, that's where you draw the line, huh Caitlyn?
Caitlyn: Don't be an asshole.
Mr. Garrison: No, you're right, that's nuts! A woman wearing a mustache, that's just ridiculous, huh Cait?
Caitlyn: Alright alright, I'll put it on, fuck.
Mr. Garrison: No no, please, Cait, don't put on a fake mustache, that's c-razy. [Caitlyn puts it on] You don't want people thinking you're a weirdo, I mean, Jeez.
Caitlyn: [taps him gently like a kitten] You-hur such an asshole.
Mr. Garrison: What the hell is this? What have they done to my town?
Principal Victoria: Keep your voice down.
Mr. Garrison: Since when do we have a flippin' Whole Foods?! [they walk towards it]
Principal Victoria: Everything's changed.
Survey worker: [stops the three of them] Hi there, you got a minute for gay rights?
Mr. Garrison: Gay rights? Jeez, you've already got all those. What the hell do you wanna do now? [the three walk on in]
Clerk: All right, your total is a hundred twenty six thirty nine, and would you like to give a dollar to help hungry children get iPads to protect your Internet safe space today?
Stephen: I will.
Mr. Garrison: What the Sam Hell is goin' on!
Leslie: Why would anyone think that I'm on the principal's side? I hate the principal. I think he's a dick.
Jimmy: So you don't know anything about the principal that might be newsworthy? Super School News worthy?
Leslie: Just that he hated me and called me a blabbermouth. I don't think I'm a blabbermouth. I just like talking to people.
Jimmy: [clears his throat] Leslie, what kind of... plans do you have? Do you have any... plans?
Leslie: What kind of plans?
Jimmy: Just, you know, plans. Like what are you hoping tooo... accomplish? [the newsmen watch from the meeting room]
Leslie: I don't know. What are your plans?
Jimmy: Well, I want to pursue careers in both news reporting and comedy.
Leslie: Really? That's... different.
Jimmy: Yeah, you're pretty different yourself, Leslie.
Leslie: How so?
Jimmy: I'm starting to think that maybe all ads aren't so bad.
Tom: Jimmy, you're thinking with your dick.
Jimmy: I am not thinking with my dick.
Tom: Yes you are.
Jimmy: No, I just think that she's a-
Tom: Put your dick away.
Jimmy: She's ag- emotional
Tom: Jim.
Jimmy: Interesting, caring girl.
Tom: Jimmy, that's your dick talking. [Jimmy stays quiet] Believe me, I know how you feel. Ads promise us things. Ads are perfect. But make no mistake: [speaks slowly] all ads lie. And all ads deceive.
Kyle: There. Leslie's Instagram and her Twitter. Last entry was ten days ago.
Butters: What about Jimmy's?
Kyle: Jimmy never used that stuff, remember? He said he hated using the Internet.
Cartman: How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties.
Butters: What are you doing now?
Kyle: I'm just looking for any news articles or anything about PC Principal. [his computer is recording the conversation] Where did you say PC Principal was from?
Stan: I think it was Vermont.
Kyle: Maybe there's something from the news in Vermont that could give us a clue about- [an ad for a Vermont vacation pops up] Goddammit what the hell is this?
Stan: That's an ad for skiing in Vermont.
Butters: Wow that looks fun! [Kyle closes the popup and tries again. A couple of windows later, he gets a news article]
Kyle: Dude. Dude, look at this. "How PC Culture is changing Vermont from a state of intolerance to a s-" [a popup ad for a guitar appears] Dude there it is again!
Kenny: What?
Kyle: It's that goddamned guitar! This ad is fucking following me!
Stan: Just click out of it.
Kyle: I'm trying! Goddammit get over here!
Stan: That's a pretty sweet-looking guitar.
Kyle: [looks at Stan] It is pretty cool dude, it tunes itself.
Cartman: How does it do that?
Kyle: It's this company that does all kinds of hi-tech instruments. See look, I'll show you.
Stan: Oh that's sweet. Send me the link to that so I can- [a popup ad for Victor Frankenstein appears] Oh dude that new Frankenstein movie is out. I totally wanna see that.
Cartman: That movie's gonna suck dude.
Stan: Hit the arrow, I wanna see where it's playing.
Kyle: [click] OH. Sorry, wrong arrow button. [a popup ad for Fun Cream ice cream appears]
Butters: Wow, what kind of ice cream is that?
Butters: So Clyde said to Token, "Why don't you open a bank account with your mouth so I can deposit my dick in it?" [the boys laugh]
Kyle: So then what'd Token say?
Butters: Well Token was all like-
Stan: Wait wait wait wait wait whoa, whoa. What the hell are we doing?
Cartman: Eating ice cream, dipshit.
Stan: But what about Jimmy? We were all like totally trying to find out what happened to him.
Kyle: Whoa, what the hell just happened?
Butters: We got distracted. We've gotta get back to that computer! [The boys split for the computer without their ice cream, except to Cartman, who takes his... and a couple of seconds later, Kenny's]
Skeeter: Now this here is a dry Riesling. You're gonna experience vanilla after-tones and a nutty finish.
Rancher: You mean like someone put their balls in the glass?
Skeeter: No, like chestnuts, dammit!
Rancher: I just can't keep up with this town no more. Everything's gettin' all nice and fancy. I swear I'm gonna need to get a second mortgage on the ranch just to pay muh daily expenses.
Randy: Don't you get it? That's just what they want. Nobody cares about the people who lived here before. They want us to move, 'cause they wanna knock our houses down and build more lofts and villas!
Skeeter: Alright Randy, you should probably lay off the old vine Chteauneuf-du-Pape.
Randy: [now by Stuart's table] You'll all see! Pretty soon everyone who used to live here is gonna have to move. And we'll be shopping at Safeway again. [sets his glass down on the table and walks out the door]
Randy: Oooff!
Caitlyn: You like apples? [punches him in the belly, causing him to groan] How d'you like them apples? [hauls him into the alley]
Randy: Hey, it's Caitlyn Jenner! [Caitlyn slams Randy against a wall face first]
Garrison: Check his ass!
Randy: Principal Victoria? [Caitlyn pulls down Randy's pants and briefs to reveal the PC branding]
Victoria: He's one of them.
Randy: One of what?
Garrison: Caitlyn. [Caitlyn punches Randy hard in the ribs. He groans and collapses onto the ground.]
Jimmy: Okay Leslie, let's try a different approach. Let's say you wanted tooo... destroy the entire species. How would you go about it?
Leslie: Why would I want to destroy an entire species? You have the wrong idea about me, Jimmy. The person trying to change things and make things terrible is the new principal.
Jimmy: And what is the new principal trying to do, Leslie?
Leslie: He's trying to make sure that people like you and me aren't allowed to exist. I know that you're trying to help. I know that the newsmen in there are trying to help too. [Kevin glances back at Tom] But now I'm going to tell you something very important, Jimmy. [the newsmen lean in towards the monitors. A popup car ad appears, and they can't see or hear what Leslie is saying.]
The Chevy Ad: [a driver walks up to his truck and plays with his dog] Like a rock. I drive a Chevy, I'm a cowboy, and I drive it like a rock.
Tom: What the hell is that?
Kevin: Tom, it looks like a popup ad.
Tom: How did an ad get in here? Let's go to David at the network hub.
David: No answers here, Tom. We're trying to correct the problem.
Leslie: You have to get me out of here, Jimmy. They're going to kill me.
Jimmy: What?
Leslie: Listen to me carefully and don't look at the glass. I feel something for you I have never felt before. I think it's trust. The men in there are sick with hatred and as soon as they realize I have no information they are going to burn me. I've seen them do it to others. Please, you have to help me, Jimmy. Don't let them hurt me. Please don't abandon me. When the lights go back on just look at me and smile.
Tom: David, any word on the popup ad situation?
David: Tom, we've just about got it fixed. It should be ready now. [the newsmen turn to look at the monitors, and Leslie is down]
Leslie: And that's really it, Jimmy. I want to help all of you however I can. [he looks at her, and smiles a second later]
Cartman: And then Token tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead. [the boys burst out laughing again]
Stan: Wait wait wait wait whoa whoa. What the hell are we doing?
Butters: We're tryin' on shoes and eatin' chicken nuggets, stupid. What do you think?
Stan: No. That's not what we set out to do.
Kyle: We were... We were on Cartman's computer looking up news stories about PC Principal.
Cartman: Didn't we finish doing that?
Stan: No, we didn't.
Kyle: It's like... someone's trying to... distract us. [looks suspiciously at Stan] Because they're worried what we'll uncover about PC people.
Stan: Yeah, like one of us is purposefully trying to keep us from digging too deep because they're afraid.
Kyle: Why are you looking at me?
Stan: Why are you looking at me?
Cartman: Why isn't anyone looking at me?
Randy: Hey, fuck you.
Garrison: Wake up, dickhead!
Randy: [opens his eyes] Garrison? The hell is wrong with you?!
Garrison: I'll tell you what's wrong with me! There's enemies to humanity out there wantin' to put an end to all of us, and there's assholes like you helpin' them out!
Randy: I don't know what you're talking about.
Victoria: Whose idea was it to revitalize the shitty part of town into an arts and foods district called ShiTpaTown?
Garrison: Son of a bitch!
Randy: What? To take one area of town that was rappy and gentrify it for the local people to enjoy? I thought we could keep it contained.
Victoria: It doesn't contain. What's happened to South Park is happening everywhere. [brings out a photo book and flips through some pictures] Thirty miles south of here in the town of Fairplay, they've changed the area north od Downtown into NoDoFoPa. A rundown area south of the capital in Cheyenne, Wyoming, is now historic SoCaCheyWo. Channel Street in mid-Chicago is being revitalized into Chimichanga.
Randy: Oh my God.
Victoria: LoDo, SoBro, RivMo, all happening at the same time. And it isn't just in the U.S. In Cairo, the area northwest of the third pyramid is NoWe3Pi. Three miles north of Auschwitz is NoMoAuchie. It goes on and on!
Randy: What does it mean?
Garrison: In our town it all started when PC Principal arrived. He's part of a mjuch larger conspiracy, and you're his lackey.
Randy: Not me. If PC Principal has been using us, I'll take the bastard down myself.
Reporter: It's day two of the hunger strike started by the college-aged fraternity brothers who are demanding that all of South Park's community leaders step down. The PC frat brothers say they've gone now two days without eating any pussy, and will continue to do so until people resign.
Tom: Who is that reporter? Do we... know him?
Kevin: Tom, that's Bill Keegan, WCFO.
Tom: Thanks, Brian. [Jimmy sneaks past the newsmen in the background] He's working for the ads, obviously. Sellout douche-bag.
Newsman: That's right, Tom. He was always a douche-bag at the conventions.
Tom: Thanks, Rick. Stay dry.
Jimmy: Leslie, come on.
Leslie: Jimmy. You're gonna help me?
Jimmy: Yeah I'm gonna help you. I mean, come on.
Tom: Jimmy! [Jimmy and Leslie turn around]
Newsman 2: Oh Jesus, he let her out.
Jimmy: PC Principal is our enemy, not her.
Tom: His dick is compromised. [spreads his arms out to protect the newsmen] Stay back! [the newsmen and Barbrady step back a few feet]
Jimmy: It is not my dick. I am thinking rationally and with logic. I am taking her out of here!
Tom: Well then, [pulls a gun out of his inside coat pocket and aims it at Jimmy] I'm sorry I'm going to have to do this, Jimmy. [walks over to Barbrady and gives him the gun] Officer Barbrady, we need you to shoot these kids.
Barbrady: What?
Tom: The ad has got to him. [puts Barbrady into a shooting stance] There's no time to argue.
Barbrady: I'm not shooting any more kids.
Tom: Do you want to save your town?!
Jimmy: Officer Barbrady, we have to stop PC Principal before it's too late.
Tom: Barbrady, shoot them in their heads!
Barbrady: No! I'm not shooting any more people! Not for you, not for nobody!
Tom: You're making the worst mistake of your life, officer.
Barbrady: Maybe so. All I know is I'm done shooting people! [his gun goes off and grazes Kevin on his left shoulder, causing it to bleed]
Kevin: Augh!
Barbrady: Oh sorry. Jeez. [Jimmy and Leslie exit first, then Barbrady follows and closes the door]
Tom: Dammit!
Stan: Think about it, you guys. From the moment that PC Principal took over Kyle has been different. Haven't you noticed?
Butters: Yeah.
Stan: He's distracting us, either because he's too afraid or because he- [Kyle arrives with his lunch and sits next to him. Butters is stunned that Kyle showed up]
Kyle: Well what are you guys talking about?
Butters: Nothin'.
Cartman: Stan's calling you a traitor.
Kyle: What?!
Stan: Kyle, I think it's pretty obvious you don't want us investigating PC Principal.
Kyle: And why do you think that, Stan?!
Stan: I don't know.
Kyle: Because if anyone has a reason for us not mess with PC Principal, it's you! Let's not forget that Stan's dad is PC Principal's little bitch!
Butters: Wuh huh, that's a good point.
Cartman: I am loving this right now.
Stan: My dad's stupid, not a bitch! This is about you being scared, Kyle!
Kyle: It is you, isn't it?! That's why you're trying to shift the blame on me. That's very Cartman of you, Stan!
Cartman: Hoh that's low. [smiles]
Stan: Don't you dare call me a Cartman!
Kyle: N-ho, that's good! Just keep on distracting everybody! It seems to be working, Cartman!
Stan: Fuck you, Kyle! [delivers a left hook and Kyle falls off the lunch bench]
Cartman: Fight! [the kids gather round to watch. Half of them are cheering them on, the other half stay quiet. Nathan stops by to see what's going on.]
Garrison: Time to take this asshole down!
Randy: [gets in front of the group] Whoa whoa whoa, guys, whoa! We can't just go walking in there.
Garrison: Why not?
Randy: This is a safe space. We're not allowed past this. When you breach a college safe space, you're crossing the most sacred human boundary there is.
Caitlyn: J'hoh, give me a break.
Randy: Nonononono, look, this is very real, and very important in PC culture. Every human has a right to a safe space and it cannot be entered.
Garrison: [determined] I can. Watch. [lifts up the PC tape and walks under and on to the house]
Randy: Wow, how did you-? [Principal Victoria and Caitlyn Jenner do the same] Whoa.
Jimmy: Burning the midnight oil, huh Nathan?
Nathan: Jimmy.
Jimmy: You sonofabitch. What have you done to the Super School News?
Nathan: I was just holding down the fort while you were away, Jim.
Jimmy: Writing headlines sponsored by PC Principal and the ads? How much did they pay you?!
Nathan: Please, Jimmy, I'm just trying to survive here.
Jimmy: Everyone's gonna know the truth, Nathan. We're getting a new edition of the school paper out by morning. Everyone's gonna know all about the ads. [Leslie punches him and he goes flying into a bookcase. She walks over and punches him five more times, then turns around and walks off to close the door. She returns and throws him up in the air. He hits the ceiling and falls to the floor. Leslie walks past Nathan, who laughs at Jimmy's misfortune]
Leslie: Deal with him. [gets on the computer and starts searching]
Jimmy: Leslie... I thought we were b-b-b-besties.
Nathan: Hey there, big man. Editor of the school paper, huh? You still don't even know half the story.
Caitlyn: It's clear.
Garrison: Where is everybody? I thought the news said they're on a hunger strike.
Randy: It doesn't make sense. Someone's always here.
Victoria: Take a look at this! [the other three adults walk over to see what she's seeing - the same State Farm ad of PC Principal and Leslie as before]
Garrison: What the hell?
Victoria: It looks like he was researching this. You see this news story?
Garrison: If this is true, then... PC Principal's trying to help.
Randy: Click on that. What is that?
Garrison: No, click out of that. What is this?
Garrison: So, so then, so then Caitlyn says "Look bitch, you're married to Bill Clinton. If anyone should be afraid of AIDS, it's you."
Caitlyn: That stupid bitch had it coming. [they all laugh]
Garrison: Oh God, I love you, Cait. We're so gong to win the primaries. [they all laugh]
Randy: Whoa, whoawhoawhoa wait wait wait. What, what were we doing again?
Kyle: Leslie.
Leslie: You're trying to find out what's going on, right? But your friend is standing in your way?
Kyle: How do you know thi-?
Leslie: I can show you what's going on, Kyle. But you have to trust me. [holds out her hand] What's the last four digits of your Sosh?
Kyle: 2692 [They shake hands, and he leaves the house with her]
PC Principal: Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others.
Russian 1: [balding, with facial stubble] Is it him?
Russian 2: [with mustache] Yes, it's him. PC Principal.
PC Principal: [walks up to the bar and puts his pickaxe aside, and drinks the glass of water waiting for him] You know, if there's one thing that makes me sick, it's when a race thinks they're superior and don't know how to check their privilege. [a Russian walks up to him and lays a hand on his shoulder. PC Principal responds with a right hook. A second Russian attacks, and PC Principal responds with a knee to the chest and slams him onto a table, which shatters under him. PC Principal then stands over him and stomps on his face, shattering his head to pieces. A third Russian lunges at him with a knife, but he kicks that Russian in the face, then delivers a head butt and snaps his neck in half. The remaining Russians back away. A fourth Russian attacks him, but he breaks that Russian's arm and punches him away. A fifth one attacks, and he punches him away. A sixth one attacks with a cue stick, but PC Principal snaps the stick in two and jabs the thick end into the Russian's right eye. A seventh one takes a shot at him, but he takes the gun and jabs the ax into the Russian's head. An eighth Russian walks up to him, but throws his hands up when PC Principal aims the gun at him.]
Russian 3: I'm not one of them! I'm not one of them!
PC Principal: An African-American flips a turtle over on its back. A transgender Filipino comes and sees the helpless turtle baking in the sun. What color is the Filipino's father? [The Russian doesn't know how to answer] I didn't think you were human. [the Russian lunges at him, but he fires off four shots through the Russian's head and kicks him in the face. He then notices his axe and pulls it out of the seventh Russian's head. He turns around and walks out of the bar.]
Butters: [still in his halo, talking to Charlotte on his iPhone] Yeah, everybody's pretty freaked out over here, baby. Everyone is on edge and feelin' really nervous.
Charlotte: That sounds terrible. Be careful, Butters.
Butters: I will, honey.
Kyle: Butters. [Butters' smile vanishes] Get to the bathroom. Now. [Butters is a bit alarmed]
Stan: Alright Kyle, what's this about?
Kyle: Jimmy's dead.
Cartman: What?
Kyle: I know the whole story. PC Principal killed him, and tried to kill Leslie, but she got away.
Kenny: (Are you fuckin' serious, dude?)
Kyle: PC Principal is part of a huge network of radicals who kill everyone who doesn't follow their PC ideology.
Stan: How do you know all this?
Kyle: Because Leslie's with me. I'm keeping her safe.
Butters: Heh, [sing-song] Kyle's got a girlfriend?
Kyle: It gets worse. Someone in this town helped these people come here. That person faked the Bill Cosby joke to get Principal Victoria fired.
Cartman: Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda?
Kyle: I think it's obvious. Stan's dad.
Stan: Kyle!
Kyle: Stan, your dad is one of them. He had to be the one to let them in.
Stan: [gets in his face] You're letting paranoia and suspicion get the better of you! [walks past him, opens the doors, and walks out]
Kyle: There's no way to know who we can trust.
Cartman: So what do we do now?
Kyle: There's only one thing we can do. [turns around] We have to get guns.
Butters: Guns?
Kyle: It's the only way for us to be safe.
Cartman: Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns?
Cartman: Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what?
Kenny: (Now we need to steal a car and escape.)
Butters: I already feel a lot safer.
Kyle: You guys lay low and watch your backs. I'm gonna go keep Leslie protected.
Cartman: Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner. [Kyle smiles and walks off. Cartman poses with his gun] Do I look sweet, Butters?
Butters: [giggles] Yeah.
Randy: What?
Stan: What?
Sharon: Can you pass the garlic bread, Randy?
Randy: Why wouldn't I be able to pass the garlic bread? [picks up the bowl and offers it to her. She takes some bread from it, and he sets it back where it was.]
Stan: Dad, where were you last night?
Randy: What, wait. Where was I what? Out, with friends, doing things. [wipes his face clean] Well I'm full. I'm gonna go work in the garage for a little bit. [leaves the table]
Stan: Work on what?
Randy: On stuff to do, things. [reaches back and takes some more food.] Um, oh I'm gonna take some of this with me. I'm still hungry.
Sharon: I thought you just said you were full.
Randy: Jee-sus! What? Am I on trial or something? God-damn! [takes the bowl of garlic bread] You guys are really acting strange. [his mouth remains a bit open as he walks away keeping an eye on the family]
Jim: Hello everyone and welcome back. We are live at South Park Elementary School where the local girl's volleyball team is about to take on the Jefferson Sabers.
Mike: And, hey Jim, it is packed. Sellout crowds tonight, first time in team history. Everyone turning out to see what's going to happen.
Jimbo: She's not gonna sit down. Why would she?
Randy: Screw that. I've got 100 bucks riding on this. Come on, Nichole. Sit on it!
Randy: This is it.
Crowd: Ooh!
Jim: Might be totally unexpected. All eyes were on Nichole when Heidi Turner comes out of nowhere and sits down.
Dave: And Mike, I've just looked at the girl's Twitter accounts and it appears they are sitting out the National Anthem to protest the harassment and trolling they receive on the Internet.
Mike: Complete surprise, Dave. Nobody saw this coming. Three girls now sitting down and finally, there goes Nichole.
Randy: Wow, Yeah, 100 bucks!
Jim: And, as the anthem draws to a close, this thing is over.
PC Principal: Alright, ladies. First of all I wanna say that I completely respect your decision to protest our national anthem. Thought it was sweet. I believe you shed some light on some very important issues regarding gender equality.
Heidi: What are you doing about Eric Cartman?!
PC Principal: Ladies, I understand you're upset about the trolling you've received on the Internet, but there is no evidence that Eric Cartman is Skankhunt42.
Wendy: It is him, it's completely obvious, and nobody is doing anything about it!
PC Principal: Mr. Cartman, I'm gonna ask you one more time, are you or are you not the Internet troll Skankhunt42?
Cartman: It's "Skankhunt42" and no I am not.
Heidi: He's lying. Make him show you his phone.
Cartman: Unfortunately, that'd be a breach of my civil rights, but I can assure you, nobody respected you girls' poignant protest more than I did.
Joe Biden: He saved Star Wars, and now we will ask him to save our country.
Lady Senator: We know you're tired.
Wendy: I'm not funny.
Cartman: Hey, girls are funny, Wendy. Okay? Get over it. Just do women's comedy stuff. You know, talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with guy and then say "my vagina" a lot..
Wendy: I don't feel like being funny right now.
Bebe: NO!
Bebe: Get the mic out of my face!
Cartman: K, that wasn't really funny, it was just angry.
Cartman: K, that's good, now just try to say it a little funnier now.
Nelly: Go ahead and get on our school message board and see what he's saying about us! Then see if you guys think it's funny!
Cartman: Okay, and then, and then, and then just go, "my vagina."
News Anchor 1: And as our country seems to be more and more divided, the only hope is that J.J. Abrams' new national anthem will appeal to everyone and bring back those nostalgic member berries we know and love.
Pollster: Hello sir. I'm with the Gallup poll. We're trying to get a read on how people will be voting in the upcoming Presidential election?
Randy: Oh. Oh-okay.
Pollster: Great. And will you be voting for the giant douche or the turd sandwich?
Randy: Well, this is usually a giant douche household but... we're going firmly with the turd sandwich.
Pollster: Oh, the turd sandwich, huh?
Pollster: Well, good luck with that, heh. So far, giant douche is leading in the polls.
Randy: What the hell is wrong with people?! They really think that a giant douche should be President?? It's insane!
Sharon: Why'd you say I'd be voting for the turd sandwich, Randy? You haven't even talked to me about it.
Randy: You can't possibly be thinking about voting for the douche?!
Stan: Hhhawgh!
Randy: What's wrong with you?
Stan: I just don't understand why every four years you people freak out over whether to vote for a giant douche or a turd sandwich.
Stan: Why are we doing this again? Why are we back to giant douche and turd sandwich?
Stan: It's nihilist.
Randy: See, you're such a nihilist.
News Anchor 2: Newest Gallup Poll results are in and they show Giant Douche to be leading Turd Sandwich by nearly 10%. Turd Sandwich has said there's no reason to panic.
Hillary Clinton (Turd Sandwich): Polls are of course a useful tool, but they can often be misleading. Our campaign is holding strong.
Hillary: Yes, Arthur?
Arthur: Uh, Mrs. Sandwich, do you believe that your opponent will gain any momentum from this poll?
Hillary: I'm sure that like me, Giant Douche realizes that polls are never the final answer.
Caitlyn: What do you mean?
Garrison: Well I mean, like, you know, once we're President and Vice-President, like, what do we do then?
Caitlyn: How the fuck should I know?
Caitlyn: What plan? I thought you had a plan.
Garrison: I don't have any fuckin' plan! That's why I have you! I'm gonna be the President and you're gonna be in charge of all foreign and domestic policies!
Caityln: I thought you were gonna do that part.
Kyle: I think they called it German Collective Guilt, right? Where even the Germans who just did nothing while Hitler rose to power were, were maybe somehow also responsible?
Mr.Mackey: Uh huh, uh, m'kay, okay.
Kyle: But I can't control what Cartman does, so, so why should I feel ashamed for what Cartman does?
Mr.Mackey: Well J.J. Abrams was just rebooting the National Anthem, Kyle, so everything's gonna be fine, m'kay?
Kyle: I don't think the answer to all this is member berries.
Mr.Mackey: You don't like mem- member berries?
Announcer: The Commander in Chief Forum, with a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Moderator: Back now with the Commander in Chief Forum. I am joined by the Republican nominee, a giant douche.
Garrison: Thanks, Matt.
Matt: Mr. Douche, some say you don't actually have a viable plan in place if you were to be elected President.
Garrison: Huh! Huh well, well who said that? The turd sandwich?
Garrison: Well, Matt, I don't think I said I would fuck them all to death.
Matt: Okay, well, let's roll the tape on that.
Crowd: Fuck them all to death!
Matt: So by our estimates, it's roughly 7.6 million people you have promised to fuck to death in your first year of office.
Garrison: Uh huh, okay.
Matt: And, and, you think that's achievable?
Teacher: Alright kids, today we have a very special treat. One of the older students has written an original children's story and is gonna read it to you. Come on over, Eric.
Preschoolers: Yeah!
Kyle: What the hell are you doing?!
Cartman: Rebooting fairy tales to try and ease the friction caused by Internet trolls.
Kyle: You really think you're fooling anyone with this fake persona?! Everyone knows you're acting this way by day so you can be horrible to people on the Internet at night!
Cartman: Why would I do that, Kyle?
Randy: What is wrong with people, huh?! How can they vote against a turd sandwich more than a giant douche?! It's senseless!
Stephen: Randy, you gotta calm down.
Stephen: Look, maybe you need some supplements to help calm your nerves. Have you heard of member berries?
Randy: Member berries?
Stephen: It's a new superfruit that helps you mellow out and relax.
Berries: 'Member The Fugitive? 'Member Akira? 'Member Alien Nation? Yeah, I 'member...
Stephen: The guys at work told me about them. Been taking them about six months now. I'll telling you, they really take the edge off.
Berries: 'Member Explorers? The little kids in a spaceship? 'Member storm troopers? 'Member?
Garrison: Come on, people! I need answers! Real solutions! You're my advisers, for Christ's sake! How do we do this?!
Adviser 1: Maybe, if you swam in a pool in Florida, you could contract the Zika virus. Then you fuck all the people you can, and hope they eventually die.
Garrison: That would take way too long! And there's no guarantee every pool in Florida has Zika!
Adviser 2: Could you use nuclear weapons? Then fuck all the bodies after the fact?
Caitlyn: Maybe you should just quit.
Butters: Haha! You guys see what Skankhunt42 did on the school server now? Hehe, he photo shopped a picture of Heidi Turner's mom with a dick in her mouth!
Craig: I wanna see.
Craig: We didn't do it.
Kyle: We all know who did! And if we don't do something, then the girls will eventually retaliate against us!
Butters: Eric! What happened!
Clyde: That's a vagina?
Cartman: Yeah, no, they do! Vaginas totally have balls! Right?
Kyle: You're just trying to start a war, aren't you?!
Cartman: What do you mean? If vaginas don't have balls, what do they have?
Caitlyn: I've tried to get people on board, but she's just such a turd sandwich. You're just gonna have to do something awful to throw the election.
Garrison: Every time I do something awful people just get more stoked on me! It's impossible to piss people off anymore!
Anchor 2: This is breaking news. The moment has arrived. It is here. J.J. Abrams says he has finished the new National Anthem.
Garrison: Turn it up.
Anchor 2: The anthem is sure to be fresh and exciting while recapturing the moments we all knew and loved. Democratic nominee Turd Sandwich said she will be in attendance to show her support for the rebooted anthem.
Garrison: Ohhh Jeeez.
Anchor 2: Let's all hope that this new anthem puts our differences aside and unites this nation once again.
Garrison: That's it, Cait. That's what I have to do. I'm gonna sit out the National Anthem on live television. Then everyone will have to vote for that turd sandwich!
Berries: 'Member Spock? Yeah. 'Member tricorders? I 'member. And 'member Bionic Man?
Randy: Ohh, I 'member.
Berries: 'Member the Millennium Falcon? 'member Chewbacca again? Oh I love to 'member Chewbacca. I 'member. 'Member? Hey hey hey! 'Member when there weren't so many Mexicans? Oh, I 'member.
Randy: Wai- what?
Berries: Yeah, yeah, yeah! 'Member when marriage was just between a man and a woman? I 'member! Oh, I 'member. Oh yeahhh.
Randy: What the fuck's going on with these member berries?
Kyle: Yeah?
Kyle: What are you doing here??
Cartman: You were right, Kyle. Okay? I drew the vagina on my face. I tried to fool people, but you keenly noticed my one tiny error in that girls don't have balls.
Kyle: I'm going to the bathroom!
Cartman: Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing. I know that a war is coming between us and the girls. I knew it the moment they sat out the National Anthem.
Cartman: Suppose for one second that I'm not Skankhunt42. And that I really have been doing what I've been doing to try and stop the damage he has done?
Kyle: Why would you care?!
Cartman: 'Cause I'm scared, Kyle. I don't know if you've noticed, but race wars are back. And now if we get gender wars too??
Kyle: If we could just prove who the troll was, then the girls wouldn't be wanting a war, would they?!
Kyle: Just know this, Cartman! I'm going to prove who Skankhunt 42 is, whatever it takes! Everyone is going to know! And Skankhunt is gonna pay for everything he's! ever! said!
Mike: Hello everyone, we are live at tonight's game between the '49ers and the Panthers, but of course what everyone is really here for, the unveiling of the new National Anthem rebooted by J.J. Abrams.
Jim: And Mike, this new anthem is said to have everything the old one had but, some new surprises as well. You'd have to be an absolute asshole not to stand and support it.
Garrison: When I sit down to not support this thing I'm sure to lose this election!
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen-
Garrison: Here it is!
Jim: And the Anthem begins, let's hope this fixes America.
Mike: More people sitting now as Abrams has made it irrelevant. Who saw this coming?
Jim: And there's the rest of the Anthem, all the parts we remembered and loved. J.J. Abrams has fixed America.
Garrison: No, this was supposed to! Oh! OHHH JEEEZ!
Kyle: Yeah Dad. Just thinkin'.
Dr. Wayne Schroeder: Nobody is safe. Nobody can hide from these monsters. Internet trolls are truly predators of society. As parents we find it hard to believe our children are doing these things online, and that is why I've been asked to come and speak to you about the student who has been trolling your school message boards.
Dr. Schroeder: We believe it probable he's one of the boy students here, since his favorite target seems to be women. Here, you can see Heidi Turner's mother photo shopped with a penis in her mouth, after she defended her daughter's right to sit out the national anthem.
Dr. Schroeder: But trolling is on the rise with teenagers, and we all need to come together to stop it. We need every parent to look for the signs in their own child.
Dr. Schroeder: In order for us to find these secretive monsters, we need all parents to ask themselves: "Could my child be a troll?".
Sheila: My God, what children are capable of now. What kind of hate would have to be in that child's heart?
Gerald: Uh, you know! Maybe the fact that it's so not funny makes it somehow funny, to kids? Gosh, I-I certainly don't understand it.
Kyle: Dude, what's going on?
Clyde: You didn't hear?
Kyle: Hear what? What happened?
Stan: Heidi Turner. She... she quit Twitter.
Stan: Yesterday after school, she wrote one last tweet that said goodbye forever, and then just got off for good.
Kyle: She'll get back on.
Stan: No dude, she threw her phone in a river. She's... she's gone.
Mr. Mackey: Alright students, I know we're all dealing with the loss of a good friend. We have to accept the fact that Heidi won't be on social media anymore. I know we're all gonna miss her, m'kay. We're gonna miss, seeing what she's up to; miss seeing her silly pictures she'd post of her and her friends, m'kay.
Mr. Mackey: So now, why don't we all get on Twitter, m'kay, and just tweet some of the, things we loved about Heidi, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey: M'kay. Oh, that's nice, that's nice, m'kay. Oh, that's a good one Sarah, uh-huh. That-that's a - that's a pretty poem. Nice Butters. Oh, Heidi would have loved this so much. This is so special, m'kay.
Stan: So tonight, whoever is doing this, isn't going to do it again! 'Cause if he does, we're gonna have to do something about it!
Gerald: You know, we had a big parent meeting at the school tonight, and uh, apparently, there's someone trolling the school message boards and, putting... penises in people's mouths. And whoever it was then got a big reaction from it, so he's now putting penises in people's mouths all over the internet. And... he's actually getting pretty famous!
Gerald: Sooo, Annie Jerkin's mother started an online campaign to stop internet trolling with a picture of her and her daughter, and you know what happened? She got a dick in her mouth!
Gerald: Ha-okay, okay, I know, it's just guy humor stuff, you know. We can laugh about about it here, but, it is serious too. Well, love you pal. Get to sleep, it's a school night.
Gerald: Oh, hey!
Sheila: Did you talk to him?
Gerald: Yeah, yeah, we talked. It was good.
Sheila: Oh, that's good.
Gerald: Yeah, well, I'd better go and get some of my work done.
Sheila: Oh, right, right, yeah.
Gerald: Yeah, don't wait up. I'll be a while with these stupid case profiles.
Sheila: All right. Night Gerald.
Woman 1: Hey! Just wanna remind everyone about the ice cream social to benefit homeless teens. Looking for volunteers.
Gerald: Hey, I'd like to volunteer to kick you in the vagina! Where do I sign up?!
Woman 2: This is my daughter at the triathlon today! Go little girl!
Gerald: Your daughter has a mustache - what the hell is wrong with your ovaries bitch?!
Commentator: You've been dick-slapped!
Bebe: You should've seen what he said about my mother on her Instagram! Pages and pages of disgusting things!
Annie: This is an attack on all of us! It's time to make the boys suffer!
Wendy: It has to be swift and serious. We have to make a statement. The girls in South Park aren't going to be treated like afterthoughts anymore!
Girls (except Heidi Turner): Yeah!
Annie: This has gone on too long and it's time to do something!
Girls (except Heidi Turner): Yeah!
Butters: They're talking about how they're gonna get us - what do you think? That's how the world works now. You get blamed for the group you belong to, even if you didn't do nothing!
Butters: What are we gonna do about them?
Kyle: The girls want to see Cartman punished so we have to prove it's him.
Craig: We're never gonna prove that and you know it! We have to make him stop!
Butters: He's not gonna stop, he's loving all this! He wants the girls to hurt us!
Clyde: Then let's end it.
Jimmy: What do you mean?
Clyde: Cartman is the cause of all our problems. Always. We all know what has to be done.
Clyde: It's not like we haven't talked about it before - fantasized about how we'd do it.
Kyle: Yeah, but not like we'd actually do it.
Stan: Clyde's right.
Kyle: Stan... You can't be thinking that we'd-
Stan: What else do we do Kyle? You know better than anybody what a monster he is.
Token: He pushed everyone too far.
Butters: It's him, or us!
Kyle: Are we seriously talking about doing this?
Craig: How would we ever get away with it?
Stan: We do it out in the woods. I know how to get him to go.
Cartman: 'Sup dudes?
Stan: Yeah, but don't tell anyone where you're going. We don't want adults to know cause there's gonna be a ton of junk food.
Cartman: Bros!! Dude, that's so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever!
Mr. Mackey: Mueeh...
Scott: I can't do this anymore! I can't take it!
Scott: Nobody ever pays attention to me! Nobody cares! I just want to end it all!
Mr. Mackey: Scott, come on, we've talked about this. You don't wanna quit Twitter.
Scott: Why not?! Everyone would be happier if I did!
Mr. Mackey: Who'd be happier?
Scott: Everyone.
Mr. Mackey: Well, what about your parents, huh? How'd you think they'd feel if you quit Twitter?
Scott: I don't think they'd even notice!
Mr. Mackey: Of course they'd notice. They'd be saad, m'kay, they'd be saad. You've got so much ahead of you Scott; so many posts and tweets still ahead of you. You haven't even started to see what social media has to offer you. You can't-you can't just end it all. Not now.
Scott: You're right, I guess I don't want to quit Twitter.
Mr. Mackey: There you go, m'kay? But now you come back here anytime you're having bad thoughts, m'kay?
Scott: Okay, thanks.
Scott: Twitter would be better off without me! I'm quitting!
Scott: What's the point!? Better to just end it all now!
Mr. Mackey: O-kay...
Token: Yeah, I'm really excited.
Cartman: I'm totally gonna do some massive pwnage. Whoever's on my team will be stoked. My laptop's so fast it doesn't lag at all. I can jump around like a pwnage powerhouse.
Clyde: I'm sure you will.
Cartman: You guys all seem kinda, like, bummed out. Is everything cool?
Stan: Everything's fine Cartman. We'll just get there sooner if maybe we don't talk much.
Kyle: We're almost there.
Cartman: This place has sweet wifi, right? Gon' be so awesome.
Man: Oh my God. Oh my God! Oh my God!
Man: Someone keeps trolling our campaign site!
Man: He just keeps leaving horrible comments, and now he's attacking me personally!
Supervisor: Aww, don't let him get to you.
Man: Don't let him-?! He took a picture I posted and put a dick in my mouth! Who does that?!
Supervisor: Someone who probably still lives with his mother and hates himself. He obviously has nothing better to do. Just let him wallow in his own misery.
Berries: 'Member the Cantina? Oh-hoh, I 'member. 'Member Star Destroyers? Yeah, I love Star Destroyers! 'Member?
Gerald: Oh, no please. It's no problem at all!
Mr. Mackey: Ohh, Scott, uh, I-it's sort of after hours, m'kay?
Scott: They all laugh at me. They won't be laughing when I do it! I'll show them!
Mr. Mackey: Hah, alright Scott. Come on inside. Huumm...
Cartman: Dude, is this where we're gonna play? I call dibs on this side! What's the wifi called? Is there a password?
Clyde: The girls are gonna do something drastic to us. We have to take matters into our own hands.
Cartman: What are you...What are you guys talking about - What-
Stan: You brought this on yourself, Cartman. We're sorry.
Cartman: Oh my God. Oh my God, you guys are gonna break all my stuff so I can't get online!
Kyle: Just put your stuff on the table and step back.
Cartman: Please! Please don't break my stuff you guys! This is like, 2 Christmases and a birthday worth of stuff! You guys can't do this! Please!
Token: Let's just get it over with!
Cartman: No, don't-get-it-over-with! Don't break my stuff! I'm not SkankHunt, I'm not! You guys, you guys, you don't have to do this! You-don't-have-to-do-this! We can still just play Counter-Strike, and forget everything! Oh-my-God, there's no wifi - We can use my phone, to make a hotspot and we can still play Counter-Strike! And it'll be sweet! You guys, come on, please! Please, you can't!
Clyde: I can't listen to this!
Cartman: Please, Clyde! Clyde, you're my friend! Please, y-you know how much - I - need - my - stuff!
Cartman: No, God! No! Don't! Don't!! Don't!! Oh my God!!
Cartman: Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Aahh!! Niah!! Niaah!! Iaahh!! Iaahh!! Niaaahhhh!!!
Stan: What have we done?
Kyle: What we had to do.
Scott: I swear to God I'm gonna do it this time.
Mr. Mackey: Okay Scott, just try to calm down. You don't want to quit Twitter.
Scott: Why does it matter? People would be happier if I just did it!
Scott: I-I talked to my dad. He said, "I don't have the guts to do it!". Well, if I'd quit Twitter, he'd be sorry!
Mr. Mackey: Okay, umm, how 'bout this, just umm, promise me you won't quit Twitter tonight, and we can - we can talk all day tomorrow, okay? M'kay?
Scott: I don't know if I'll make it through the night!
Scott: I just feel like I'm at the edge of a cliff, you know, and being chased by hate. And the only way out is to jump!
Scott: I keep thinking about what the kids at school would do, when they find out I left all my social media. Like they would finally see all the damage they've done.
CNN Reporter: Another internet troll is wreaking havoc on message boards, this time attacking a Danish website for women with breast cancer.
Gerald: I made the news...
CNN Reporter: The troll, who goes by the name "SkankHunt42", ...
Freja Ollegard: This little troll can have his fun. I am going to be the bigger person. I am going to show the people of Denmark are not so easily broken down.
Gerald: Hmm...Game on whore. Game on.
Kyle: What's going on?
Stan: You didn't hear?
Kyle: Hear what?
Stan: The troll, SkankHunt, Kyle. He was all over the internet last night!
Kyle: No, that's impossible!
Kyle: Oh my God. Oh my God...
Nelly: The time has come. We said if the trolling didn't stop, there would be severe consequences. Get the word out to every girl in school. It goes down tomorrow!
Wendy: Oh my God...I don't know if I can go through with this.
Nichole: We all have to be on-board Wendy. Every girl in school, or it means nothing.
Annie: Don't forget what you said Wendy: "For too long girls here have taken the backseat! Things have to change!". Now they'll have to listen.
Simply Heidi: We are back again with the brave Olympic gold medalist from Denmark, Freja llengrd. Freja, you've talked about being trolled on the Internet and its consequences.
Freja Ollegard: Yes, Heidi. I believe trolling has a tragic effect on innocent people.
Simply Heidi: You have been the victim of horrific degrading attacks, spearheaded by a troll called [puts on her glasses] skankhunt42.
Gerald: [watching on his computer, holding a glass of wine] Nice.
Freja Ollegard: I've tried to just ignore the trolls, but that only seems to make them attack me more.
Simply Heidi: It must be so awful for you to create a Web site for women like yourself who are breat-cancer survivors and these... monsters get on and somehow make light of it. Even going as far as... ridiculing masdectomies.
Freja Ollegard: Yes, it's very disgusting, but I still try very hard to believe in the goodness of humanity. [cheers from teh studio audience.]
Simply Heidi: I can tell you that the support for you on our Web site has been overwhelming. We'd like to share some comments we've received, many from doctors who believe your Web site is saving lives. The first is a comment from a physician in Spain: "You go girl. You are doing great things. Don't let trolling stop you." And that is from Dr. Juerdior Titsgo [Freja is alarmed at the name], in Spain.
Gerald: [exults at his coup] He shoots, he scores! [Freya knows she's been trolled again and puts her face in her palm]
Simply Heidi: And there's this one: "Believe in yourself and don't listen to the haters. You're an inspiration." That's from Hungarian physician Dr. Cootsier Boobsoff.
Audience Member: Oh no...
Gerald: HA! [throws an air ball] From the 3-point line!
Simply Heidi: I'm sorry, am I missing something?
Gerald: Oh! Police! [sheepishly] Yes?
Officer: Hello, sir, we're conducting an investigation.
Gerald: Uh... regarding... uh regarding what?
Barkley: Do you happen to know this child? [shows him Cartman's picture from Photo Day]
Gerald: [relieved] Hoooh. Sure, that's one of my son's friends.
Barkley: Well, I'm afraid he's... quit Twitter.
Gerald: Hooo... another one, huh?
Barkley: Yeah, but this one's different. The events surrounding his quitting Twitter were very suspicious. Most people that quit Twitter leave at least three paragraphs stating that they're quitting Twitter before they quit Twitter. This child just stopped using it.
Gerald: Kyle! [looks up the stairs]
Barkley: We're simply trying to gather information on whether this was a Twitter suicide or a Twitter homicide. [Kyle appears at the top of the stairs]
Gerald: Kyle, have you seen your friend Eric online?
Kyle: [panics a bit] No. Uh, he quit.
Barkley: D'ya happen to know why, son?
Kyle: He probably got fed up with all the negativity and decided to end it. [shrugs] I don't know.
Barkley: Without tweeting a goodbye? People don't just quit social media. They post long drawn-out messages on social media, explaining why they're leaving social media.
Gerald: Look, officers, why don't you just go ask him why he quit Twitter?
Barkley: At where, sir? at where?
Kyle: Okay, that was the cops! The cops were here!
Clyde: The cops? For what?
Token: You know for what! You know what we did to Cartman! [he's video-chatting with the other boys on his computer, in several windows]
Craig: We did what we had to do.
Kyle: But we were wrong!
Butters: [under his bed covers] It's not the police we have to worry about, it's Eric. He's gonna get us
Jimmy: Hey. W-we all just have to stay cool, okay?
Butters: It doesn't matter. He's comin'. He's comin' to get us.
Randy: Stan? [Stan's door is open, so Randy walks in] You can't just stay in your room all day.
Stan: What happened, Dad? [Randy walks up to the bed] Everything's upside down. [Randy sits] Everyone's taking sides and splitting into groups. [thoughtfully] Everything sucks.
Randy: [rubs the back of his neck] Yeah, everything sucks. [lowers his hand] Everyone's divided. Nobody's getting along. And there's people like your MOTHER who are thinking of voting for a DOUCHE because she doesn't have a BRAIN.
Sharon: [off screen] Go to hell, Randy!
Randy: I don't know what's wrong with people in this town. More and more are agreeing with your mother. I tried getting on community message boards and swaying people's minds but... it always ends up with some asshole talking about vaginas and photoshopping a dick in my mouth. That's where we're at today. Everything sucks.
Aide 1: Here's everything to prepare you for the debates, ma'am. Just try and stay focused no matter what your opponent says.
Aide 2: Don't let him rattle you. He's gonna do whatever he can to try and mess with your head. Bon't buy into it. Whatever he says, just respond with "My opponennt is a liar, and he cannot be trusted."
Clinton: Got it.
Announcer: Decision 2016. The first Presidential debate, with moderator Lester Holt.
Lester Holt: Okay, let's get right into it. Our first question is for you, sir. How will you deal with ground troops in Syria?
Garrison: Everyone, I need to just speak from the heart here. Uhm, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I've gotta come clean. Uh, I had no idea I would get this far, [Holt looks confused] but the fact of the matter is, I should not be President. Okay? [Clinton's aides watch from a back room] I will fuck this country up beyond repair. [Clinton's aides smile at this admission] I'm a sick, angry little man. Please, if you care at all about the future of our country, vote for her. Okay? She's the one who at least has some experience. She, she's not as bad as you think, I promise. And unlike me, she's actually capable of running this country.
Clinton: ...My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted.
Aide 1: NOOO!
Aide 2: Oh my God, she's such a turd sandwich.
Clinton: What he is saying is simply not true. Do not... believe it.
Garrison: [throws his hands up and then faces Clinton] I am giving you this, lady. I AM GIVING you this! What the fuck are you doing?! [faces the audience again] Okay, look, look, just, vote for her, she... she knows politics. She really wants to put this country first.
Clinton: My opponent is a liar-
Garrison: Would you just please shut up?
Clinton: -And he cannot be-
Garrison: Get out of your own way.
Clinton: -cannot be trusted.
Garrison: [in exasperation] Okay, okay, look. [stands up again] She doesn't mean what she's saying. She just doesn't know how to take this because... it's very weird and her advisers probably t-
Clinton: My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted. [as she says this, he throws his hands up and turns his back to the camera]
Garrison: Fuck, oh fuck, why the fuck does it have to be her? I am so fucked.
PC Principal: Alright boys, I've had just about enough of playing games. [before him are Kyle, Stan, Butters, and Token] The four of you were good friends with Eric Cartman, and yet none of you seem to know why he left social media. [Butters fidgets a bit] Nobody's get anything to say? Well I have a theory. I think... that Eric Cartman... was somehow forced to leave social media as a retaliation for Heidi Turner quitting social media! Now, because of the actions of one sexist, bogoted, racist troll! [sweeps his hand across his desk and knocks a stack of papers to the floor]
Butters: [lets out a] Eeeaaaahhhh!
PC Principal: We have a gender war on our hands! Make no mistake, gentlemen! Our community is under attack! And if we don't get to the bottom of it... there's gonna be more students like Eric Cartman... wandering the hallways with no connection to the rest of the world.
Voice: [gruff whisper] Eric. [he looks up. By some exit doors is Heidi]
Cartman: Heidi? Heidi Turner?
Heidi: Come with me.
Cartman: Where? [she turns and walks off to her left]
Heidi: Join us. [points to a park] here.
Cartman: The park?
Heidi: I know how you feel, Eric. I know how hard it is when school gets out. With no phone, no human contact.
Cartman: [begins to cry] I miss my stuff.
Heidi: Come on. There are others like us here. [guides him into the park. A car appears and slows down]
Driver: Look at them, Martha. Do you see them?
Martha: What are they?
Driver: Lost souls who have quit Twitter. Damned to just wander the earth and hang out and stuff.
Martha: They seem so lonely. [they both look at their phones]
Randy: Okay, what?! The fuck?! Is wrong with you people?! I just saw a new poll that says more and more of you are thinking about voting for that douche!
Stephen: Some are. A lot of people like what he has to say, alright?
Randy: You're tellin' me that after that debate, you still wanna vote for that guy?!
Stephen: More than ever.
Ryan Valmer: Yyyup.
Randy: Did you see the same debate I saw?!
Stephen: Don't you get it, Randy? There's people in this country who are sick and tired. Tired of hearing all the rhetoric. Tired of Washington failing us while they pat their own backs. Finally someone comes along and says what he feels. That's why people like him. You can say what you want, at least he doesn't sound like another politician.
Garrison: America, please listen to me. I have no idea how to be President. I am a complete jackass, and I have made a giant mistake here. [the crowd cheers his honesty, which stuns him] Nononono, nononono, why are you clapping? I'm not a good person for the White House. I am not a good person, period.
Man: Finally, someone who doesn't talk like a politician.
Garrison: I am peeing my pants... at the thought of being President, okay? [more cheers go up] No! Shut up! Listen to me! [the crowd quiets down] You don't want a guy like me in the White House! You don't even wanna know the shit I've done!
Random Person: Wooohooo!
Garrison: I have scissored with another woman when I had a sex change!
Man 2: He's so honest!
Garrison: No, no! I'm not the guy you want going to Russia to negotiate with Putin. I'll probably end up gettin' drunk and tryin' to suck his dick. [more cheering. He turns away from the mic] OHHHH JEEEZ
Gerald: Ike, got a minute? [enters and sits on Ike's bed] Let's talk, buddy. [Ike pauses his game and goes to his bed] You know, the school really wants us to keep talking to our kids about trolling on the Internet and how serious it is. I guess the troll from the school message boards is now harassing a famous Olympic athlete from Denmark, heh. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah well, she kinda called him out and said he could never get her to quit social media, and you know, you might say she's askin' for it. But uh, now this troll is being copied by other trolls who are all dog piling to see if they can get her to quit and, well God only knows what they're gonna do tonight. Well, goodnight, pal. You be sure to let your mom know we talked more about the horrific consequences of trolling. [steps outside, then leans back and smiles at Ike, then leaves and closes the door]
Heidi: I want to tell you... that I'm sorry.
Cartman: For what?
Heidi: When women first started getting trolled on the school message boards. I was sure it was you. I was wrong.
Cartman: You weren't the only one. I guess I didn't deserve a second chance. I really tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show that I was trying to listen.
Heidi: So when you held the assembly that woman were just as funny as men, you... you weren't being sarcastic?
Cartman: [earnestly] Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fuckin' mind.
Heidi: Do you miss your friends?
Cartman: I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did.
Heidi: You do now. [smiles at him]
Cartman: Kewl.
Newt Gingrich: Hello Florida! Please put your hands together and welcome the next President of the United States! [makes way for Mr. Garrison]
Garrison: I hate all of you so much.
Random Person: Yeah!
Garrison: I seriously hold so much contempt for each and every one of you pieces of shit. [cheers] If you vote me in as President I'll seriously throw up and have lost all faith in humanity. [more cheers]
Randy: [watching on TV] I agree.
Garrison: I don't wanna be here. Please just let me go. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know anything. I'm scared. I'm completely clueless how to proceed. I just... spew bullshit and cry myself to sleep at night. Stop thinking that I'm anything more than a douche in over his head. For fuck's sake, please.
Randy: Shit, I'm startin' to really like this guy.
CNN Anchor: And after stating that he was not fit to be President, Secretary Clinton responded with "My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted."
Patron: I am so confused.
CNN Anchor: In other news tonight, Danish gold medalist Freja llengrd is the apparent victim of extreme trolling once again. [Gerald walks into the bar and watches the report]
Gerald: Oh. Eh hey, can you turn that up?
CNN Anchor: The athlete from Denmark has been the target of relentless online attacks that began with the troll skankhunt42. [Gerald smiles and looks around to see if anyone has figured out it was him who's the troll] Last night the trolling took a vicious turn when Freja llengrd finally succumbed to the pressure and committed suicide. [Gerald's smile vanishes.]
Field Reporter: Paul, Danish women's volleyball champion Freja llengrd has been pronounced dead outside her apartment in Copenhagen. [there's fear in Gerald's face] The four-time girls' medal winner took her own life after jumping 17 floors off the balcony of her building. [footage is shown of her doing this, with a klieg light focused on her all the way down. She lands on a car and shatters, blood going all over the place. The car's alarm turns on]
Paul: Freja llengrd, dead at the age of 38. [Quickly, Gerald runs to the restroom and into a stall. A patron watches him enter and continues doing so until the scene ends]
Gerald: [on the toilet seat] Oh my God! Oh shit! Oh shit oh my God! Oh God oh no-oohh!
Randy: I was wrong, Stephen, I'm votin' for your guy.
Stephen: [surprised] What?
Randy: It's just... [walks in] I see what you mean. He talks like an ordinary person. And he has a lot of the same emotions I do, you know? He's got my vote.
Stephen: Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
Randy: [turns around] What?
Stephen: You wanna vote for that douche?! He'll ruin this country!
Randy: You were just voting for him yesterday!
Stephen: Yeah, but not anymore!
Randy: What happened??
Stephen: I don't know.
Randy: What the hell is wrong with people?! You just don't flip back and forth like that?!
Stephen: You just did.
Randy: [processes that reply] ...I did. What's going on, Stephen? Why does everything suck this hard?
Stephen: I don't know. Nobody knows what to think anymore.
Randy: But how did we get here? Completely confused and with shit for choices? It's like... it's like there are other forces at work.
Stephen: I'm just tired of thinkin' about it. Come on, let's relax and' have some member berry pie.
Randy: [thinks a moment] Member berry pie... [drops the thought] Okay, I love member berries. [follows Stephen to the dining room table]
Berries: 'Member Tattooine? 'Member the torture droid? I 'member? Hi, 'member Goonies? I loooved Goonies. 'Member Chunk? 'Member? 'Member the trash compactor? Oh, the trash compactor.
Randy: [picks some berries up with a spoon, but stops] Wait a minute... [a camera pans away from the Stotch house into space, then moves east to Europe, then zooms in on Denmark.]
Troll Hunter: [in a Danish accent] Citizens of Denmark, we are under attack. As our ancestors did in days long ago, we must rise to defend our families. [Freja's casket is slowly brought to the altar outside the cathedral] A troll has come into our village and taken from us a beloved princess. He then returned to his secret hiding place, crawled back to his little cave, thinking the Danes would simply cry and run. [a mourner sobs] No. What this troll doesn't realize is that we have been planning our own attack. I'm announcing here and to the world that a plan to destroy the troll is underway. For in Denmark there is one thing we have known for centuries. To get the troll to come out of hiding, you must say its name.
Heidi: Hey.
Cartman: Hey. [long pause] I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny.
Heidi: Why is that?
Cartman: Because, black laughs matter.
Heidi: ...Is that a joke?
Cartman: Yes, it is.
Heidi: I don't get it.
Cartman: Yes, you do. [Heidi just looks downward] Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world?
Heidi: The hardest part is not having any followers. I used to go places just to show them where I was.
Cartman: You wanna go somewhere? I'll follow you. [Heidi smiles]
Jud: Mornin'. How can I help ya?
Randy: Yeah, I have some questions about uh member berries?
Jud: Yeah'. Everyone wants member berries these days. [turns left and walks off] Right over heah. [Randy joins him] Don't know what makes them so popular. I've had to get rid of all mah pumpkins, mah onions and mah peppahs, just to make room for more membah berries. [the voices of member berries get louder as they approach the berry grove. There are berries as far as the eye can see.]
Randy: Oh my God, there's this many?
Berries: 'Member the 80s? Oh, 'member the 90s? Yeah yeah, but 'member the 80s though? Nonono, 'member the 90s?
Gerald: Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Protocol Zero. No evidence, clear history. E-mails! delete, delete, delete, erase, erase, trash, trash. [reaches into his glove compartment and pulls out a hammer called "Protocol Zero." He leaves the car with phone and hammer in tow. An elderly woman draw near as he smashes the phone to bits on the roof of his car. Once he's destroyed the phone, he gets into his car and peels out. He rushes home and runs up to his office. He turns on his computer and begins to delete stuff in the Gerald folder he has on there. After that he opens up the computer and pulls out the hard drive. He takes the computer apart, puts it all in a duffel bag and drives to Stark's Pond, where he sets up a portable foot-operated catapult and launches the duffel bag into the pond. He quickly rushes home again and sites next to Sheila on the couch. Sheila just glances at him]
Shelia: I saw Nancy Morris today. She has a different hair color. Again. I swear she doesn't think anyone even notices. Her natural hair color must be clear.
Gerald: [rushed] Our computer's broke.
Shelia: ...What?
Gerald: It broke and I had to throw it away.
Shelia: I thought if a computer isn't working, you try and get it fixed.
Gerald: No now you just throw it away.
Shelia: You had all my recipes on that FileMaker program on your computer.
Gerald: I'll get us a new computer tomorrow. Then I can see if we can pull your recipes up from Ike's computer, and that way we- Ike's computer! Shit! [runs upstairs]
Gerald: Move move move! [pushes Ike out of the way and gets to work] My computer is off the network, and, and this computer didn't mirror that computer, but they did share the same Time Machine schedule, so then, would any of my files be accessible? No, because they didn't know each other's IP addresses. What if you can access my e-mail account from this computer through iCloud? If I go to iCloud, my e-mails are deleted. Good. Except there's a new e-mail. [It's from unknown] That shouldn't have come in. Why would an e-mail to me have come in if I deleted everything? [he reads the e-mail. It says the same thing the note did] "I know who you are." [spins around and points at Ike] You? Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am, Ike?
Ike: No, but I want to, Dad.
Gerald: [thinks of the Biblical sense] Not like that, smartass! [turns back to the computer and works on his account] Delete! Delete the account, not the e-mails! [gets an e-mail: "You have a Google alert!" He clicks OK and reads] "meet me under the freemont bridge. 9 am tomorrow." [panics] Oh God...
Heidi: You dip your French fries in the sweet & sour sauce?
Cartman: Yeah. It's the best, dude. Try it.
Heidi: [tries it and eats] Wow, that's really good. I'm starting to feel like life isn't gonna be so bad.
Cartman: Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something?
Heidi: Yeah, of course.
Cartman: Do girls... not have balls?
Heidi: Girls do not have balls, no
Cartman: So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work? [she wonders why he's asking] I just don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina.
Heidi: [munches on a fry] Do you want me to show you?
Cartman: ...Holy shiiit.
Narrator: Long ago, in the deep and frozen lands of Scandinavia, there were creatures who wreaked havoc on humanity. [A troll is seen] The Troll. They dwell in rocks, in caves, isolated from civilization. The creatures were ugly, fat and slow-witted, but some could look and behave like human beings. These are the most dangerous. Now, the creatures have returned, this time, a thousand miles across the sea. [Earth is seen as it rotates. It zooms in on America, and an internet troll is seen] Today, the monsters believe they can go undetected, [Different trolls are seen] free to attack and then retreat to the darkness. But in Denmark, we have dealt with the trolls before, and now and now, we shall deal with them... again.
Kyle: Dad, can I talk to you?
Gerald: Sure, Kyle.
Kyle: All the girls at school are really mad. It's like, one guy gets online and says terrible things about girls and it reflects badly on all of us.
Gerald: Uh huh.
Kyle: Everyone's sad, everyone's depressed and nobody knows how to move forward.
Gerald: Good.
Kyle: I guess what I'm saying is, I'm starting to feel a lot of guilt, just for being a boy. How do I not feel that?
Gerald: Sorry Kyle, I have to meet someone. Talk to your mother. [gets off the couch] I love you! [walks away]
Butters: It's been a rough few weeks, Baby. The girls are still mad about being trolled on the school message board, parents are all freaking out about the election and, and I tell you... you are glad to not be living in this country right now.
Charlotte: Butters,I'm sorry, but I told you not to Skype me anymore, right?
Butters: [becomes shocked] But Baby, I love you! I need you! You can't break up with me!
Charlotte: I have to stand with my girlfriends.
Butters: Oh my god, I can't believe they got to you. [starts shouting] Those sneaky snakes in the grass!
Charlotte: Who?!
Butters: Well you know who, the girls in my school! They all broke up with their boyfriends and now they got you to go along with them!
Charlotte: This is a time when women and girls have to stick together.
Butters: So then it's true! You're all snakes in the grass! Every [slams the keyboard] last one of you!
Charlotte: [ends the call]
Butters: Oh Charlotte? [presses on the mouse] Are you there? [presses on the mouse] Honey?
Gerald: [takes off his sunglasses] I don't know why you are harassing me. I don't even own a computer.
Dick: My name is Dick.
Gerald: Are you with the NSA or Homeland Security?
Dick: No! I'm a colleague.
Gerald: A colleague?
Dick: You probably know me as "Dildo Shwaggins".
Gerald: Dildo Shwaggins from Pussystores.org?!
Dick: We need to talk.
Gerald: You're just a troll?! [turns to his left, raises his arms, and looks up] Oh thank god!
Dick: We're on the same team, Skankhunt.
Gerald: [lowers his hand] Wait, but that means I went "Protocol Zero" for nothing. Oh shit [throws his cup of coffee]!
Dick: What's "Protocol Zero"?
Gerald: [circles around and then sits] Everything's gone! I destroyed my computers, my phone! [looks at Dick] Why couldn't you just say, "I know who you are. I'm a troll too,"? Why do you have to be so fucking cryptic?!
Dick: Us trolls have to be careful. You know that.
Gerald: Look, I'm not really a troll, okay? I just started as a Yelp reviewer and got sick of how everyone's stupid comments sounded. I just like messing with people 'cause it was funny. I got carried away!
Dick: These are really dangerous times, Skankhunt. There are there are things happening in the world and trolls have to come together.
Gerald: For what?
Dick: Someone is trying to wipe us out! Our way of life is in danger.
Gerald: It's not a way of life! I was just doing it for the LOLs.
Dick: That's not true. I've studied your work. You're one of the best trolls I have ever seen.
Gerald: [stands up] No, no! I am done with this crap. I thought my wife was going to find out, [grabs his sunglasses] but that was too spooky. [puts on his sunglasses and walks away].
Dick: Gerald, we need each other. The Danish [raises his arms] are planning something horrible against us.
Gerald: [stops and faces Dick] I'm not one of you, okay? I just need to stop. [tries to climb up the steep dirt, but falls down].
Kyle: [talks while pacing back and forth] Guys, I've been thinking this over a lot and ... we need to be more active in showing the girls that we respect them. There's a big girl-volleyball game tonight and we should all go and show our support.
Stan: You really think that's gonna make a difference?
Kyle: I do. We need to show the girls that not all boys aren't the same and that we are willing to change. [stops pacing]
Butters: Well why don't you just shut the fuck up, Kyle? [talks while walking] All I've been hearing in a few weeks is how [stops walking]this is our fault, how boys need to change. Well I'm getting pretty sick of it. Everyone else seems to be proud about who they are, but not us; and then we get Uncle Kyle here telling us that the girls are right!
Kyle: Butters?
Butters: [turns towards and points at him] This is a war [walks from Kyle] on all of us. You want to listen to Uncle Kyle, we'll go ahead. Pretty soon [stops walking, and faces Tweek and Craig] they'll be locking us all up. And don't think you're safe either, Tweek and Craig. Just 'cause you're gay does not mean that you aren't looked down upon for being boys! [turns to his left] The world wants us all to feel shame just because we were all born with [points downwards] wieners!
Kyle: Butters, you need to calm down.
Butters: No! [walks towards Kyle] We tried doing it your way, Kyle. We tried doing what the girls wanted us to do and where did it get us?
Clyde: Nowhere.
Butters: [turns around] Right! It turned us against one of our own match, that's what it did! What happened to Eric Cartman is the girl's fault, not ours!
Token: That's true!
Butters: I'm done feeling guilt. I'm a boy, dang nab it! And you know what? I'm proud of my little wiener. Mark my words, the moment is coming when you all need to decide; are you with your kind, [points at Kyle] or are you with Uncle Kyle.
Sheila: Gerald, you've been sitting at the table for three hours now. You okay?
Sheila: Not at all, Gerald. I'm sorry.
Sheila: Well! I know you said your computer was broken. So, I went ahead and got you something. [takes out iPad from a bag] Here, it's your own iPad.
Gerald: [gets frightened, stands up and tries walking away from Sheila] Ah! Ah ah, ah! No, no! I'm good. Get that away from me.
Sheila: [turns to her husband] You don't like it?
Gerald: No, sorry! I love it! I'm just swearing off electronics for a little bit. [leans closer to the iPad and speaks softer in a harsh tone] Or maybe I can just get on a couple of message boards. [backs away and speaks normally] No, I'm good! I don't need it!
Sheila: Gerald, [walks closer to Gerald] what's going on?
Gerald: Nothing, Sheila. I'm fine. [turns so his body faces the table] I'm just trying to make some changes and less electronics is part of it. I'm sorry, Honey. Everything is okay. Promise.
Sheila: Okay, Gerald. I'll make us some lunch. [walks to the kitchen] Oh uh, did that guy outside talk to you?
Gerald: [faces the front window] What guy outside? [walks towards the window and sees Dick on the other side of the road from his house] What the fuck? [checks on Sheila and then whispers to Dick] Go away, go! [waves his arms sideways] Go! Go away! Go go!
Gerald: [whispers quickly, closes the blind and curtains of the window, and then walks away]
Sports Commentator: Welcome students and parents to tonight's matchup between the South Park Cows and the Bona Festa Demons.
Kyle: Dude, this is awesome! Did you see how many of the boys I've got to come out tonight?!
Stan: Yeah! This is a pretty sweet turnout!
Wendy: [smiles at Stan]
Kyle: This is exactly what we needed. Thank god people listen to me.
Referee: [blows whistle]
Sports Commentator: And now please sit, stand, or kneel for the National Anthem.
Butters: [takes off his pants and underwear, pulls his shirt, and raises his fist causing people to be shocked]
Jason: Holy crap, dude. Look at Butters.
Kyle: Oh [hits his face] no!
Gerald: [walks through town depressed and then quickly dodges a bicyclist] Son a bitch! Ahhh! [walks near the Community Center, reads a sign about addiction problems, and checks the group]
Randy: Gerald. Hey come on in. You're not alone, bud. We're all facing the same struggles and trying to do something about it. Anyways please continue, Richard.
Gerald: [sits on the available chair to the right of Randy]
Richard: Well like I was saying, I've been addicted to memberberries for the past two months now.
Randy: It's okay, man. You're not alone.
Richard: It's just, you know, 'membering is more fun than thinking. I want so bad to go back to when things were good. When I was a kid, you know like, the 80s and the 90s, and things made sense.
Randy: And that's how we got here to this very memberberry election.
Gerald: What is this?!
Randy: What have been your struggles with memberberries, Gerald?
Gerald: I, I don't even know what a member--.
Berries: [muffled from Michael's pocket] 'Member the Dagobah? Yeah, I remember the Dagobah. That's where Yoda lives. 'Member Yoda?! Oh, I 'member!
Randy: [coughs] Michael, are there memberberries in your pocket?
Berries: Oh, 'member Corellian Corvette?! I remember Corellian Corvette!
Randy: Anyway, Gerald, what has your experience been?
Gerald: I don't even know what memberberries are.
Stephen: Gerald, come on. The first step towards healing is admitting you've got a problem.
Gerald: Yeah. [stands up and points at Stephen] Well you've got a fat pussy, and you should go and fucking kill yourself! [calms down] Sorry, I think I'm in the wrong place. [walks away]
PC Principal: Make no mistake! I want to be very upset. However, as a community, we have all decided that people have the right to protest the National Anthem.
Wendy: They took their wieners out!
PC Principal: [points upwards] Correct! [lowers his arms] But they did so peacefully and without malice towards others.
Wendy: This was an attack on us. This is exactly why we sat out the National Anthem in the first place!
PC Principal: I want you to understand something, ladies. [positions his hands parallel from each other] I am in a PC Pretzel here because if I say [moves his hands to his right] they can't protest even though [moves his hands to the left of him] you protested [moves his hand back towards the middle] and the only difference is that their protest included physical gestures, then I'm body shaming!
Bebe: So you're just gonna let the boys take their wieners out whenever they want?
PC Principal: That's what happens when you sit out the National Anthem.
Butters: [speaks through a microphone while rallying a group of boys with their pants pulled out] We walk together in peace! We walk together in peace! We're not poor for feeling ashamed in who we are! We're not gonna feel guilt for the way we were born! Wieners out!
Wieners Out Boys (expect Butters): Wieners out!
Butters: Don't let anyone tell you you are somehow nice because you're a boy! Don't let anyone tell you to not think with your wiener, as if your wiener is a bad thing!
Wieners Out Boys (expect Butters): Yeah!
Butters: What makes us different makes us beautiful! No more shame, no more doubt, no more bigotry!
Wendy: [runs away from the rally]
Wieners Out Boys (expect Butters): Wieners out!
Butters: Don't be an Uncle Kyle! Be proud of who you are!
Stan: [pulls down his pants and joins the rally]
Butters: You are either with us or against us! It's really that simple!
Gerald: [whispers] Damn it! [waves his arms away from the window] I live here! Stop that! [shuts the curtains and lies on the bed next to Sheila]
Sheila: [stops reading and faces Gerald] You don't have to work tonight?
Gerald: No, nothing!
Sheila: Wow! I don't remember the last time you were able to get in bed the same time as me.
Gerald: Got all caught up with work!
Sheila: Hey, I'm not complaining. [closes her book] It feels good to have you here.
Gerald: [gets off the bed and runs away] I'm going on a run!
Gerald: [gets surprised by the car honking at him] Ah! [raises his fist] Fuck you! ["flips" his index fingers] Fuck you!
Gerald: [talks from the master bathroom] Yeah!
Sheila: [fully wakes up]
Gerald: Screw you, Skank! You fat little bitch! Go kill yourself, whore!
Shiela: [gets off bed and walks near the master bathroom].
Gerald: Yeah, fuck you, bitch! Fuck you! [chuckles]
Sheila: Gerald? [opens the door, gets scared of the Gerald's creepy face, screams, and runs away]
Gerald: [lays iPad in the sink and chases Sheila] Oh, sorry, Hun! Sorry!
Kyle: Everyone all right, guys?
Gerald: Everything's fine, Kyle. Go back to bed.
Sheila: [wipes her eyes with tissue] One night you, you say all of our computer stuff is broken and you, you hide everything and then you show up with all of this new equipment and now this! Please, tell me what's going on!
Gerald: Nothing is going on!
Sheila: [points at Gerald] You hissed at me! You went [faces to her right, hisses, and then faces back at him].
Gerald: Okay, okay. I'm going to tell you the truth, Sheila. I watch porn on the Internet. I'm sorry. I'll try to stop.
Sheila: But I know you watch porn. You told me you watched porn and I told you that I don't care, Gerald.
Gerald: Oh yeah! But uh, it's uh, but this is different.
Sheila: Why?! Because it's not normal porn?
Gerald: Right!
Sheila: Like something really embarrassing?
Gerald: It's really embarrassing.
Sheila: Tell me!
Gerald: It's... porn! It's... uh, piss! Porn! Piss porn!
Sheila: Piss porn? Like people peeing on each other?
Gerald: [stands up] See?! [walks closer to Sheila] It's so embarrassing! No wonder I hid it, right?! [wipes his forehead] Whew! [moves closer to Sheila] I'm sorry! It's good to get it out in the open though. [walks to bed]
Sheila: Do you want me to pee on you?
Gerald: [stops and turns around] No!
Sheila: You only like watching other women pee?
Gerald: [walks closer to Sheila] Oh no, no! It's not like that.
Sheila: [turns around] Because they're pretty? You have to watch around a video because I'm overweight and old?
Gerald: No! I, I, I want you to! I just couldn't ask.
Sheila: You do, promise? [faces Gerald]
Gerald: [in complete shock] Yes?
Sheila: Am I doing it right, Gerald?
Gerald: Yep! [gnarls]
Ike: [watches Gerald and Sheila from the hallway]
Gerald: So hot, I mean [gnarls] warm! [gnarls some more]
Kyle: [walks behind Ike and gets shocked by Gerald and Sheila's actions]
Kyle: Hi, Cartman.
Cartman: [looks at Kyle] Hey, Kyle.
Kyle: I'm so sorry, what we did to you. This Internet troll has everyone going crazy. We shouldn't have assumed it was you. We shouldn't have broke all of your stuff.
Cartman: Cool. That's cool.
Kyle: No! I know it's not cool. I know you're figuring out how to get back at us.
Cartman: I saw a vagina, Kyle.
Kyle: What?!
Cartman: I'm not holding a grudge. I'm happier now. I have purpose.
Kyle: You saw who's vagina?
Cartman: My girlfriend's. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast. But in that instant, you know what I saw? I saw that humankind can colonize Mars. I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and reach the infinite.
Kyle: [lays his hand on his forehead] Yeah right, okay. [lowers his hand] I'm being serious, Cartman. Butters needs to be taken down a notch and you're the best at that.
Heidi: [overlaps Kyle's last few words and approaches Eric] Eric, hey! I got us both chocolate milks.
Cartman: [stands up and talks to Heidi] Of course you did 'cause you're amazing. Look at what I made you.
Heidi: The pink and blue one?!
Cartman: That's what my baby wanted.
Heidi: [raises her arms and cheers] Yay, [lowers her arms] put it on me!
Cartman: [puts the necklace on Heidi and faces Kyle] Oh sorry. Heidi, you know Kyle?
Heidi: [faces Kyle] Oh yeah. Hey, Kyle. [talks to Eric while they hold hands] The show's on at five tonight if you want to watch it at your house or my house.
Cartman: Oh either way, we totally can. I, I guess Kyle has something to talk to us something about first, um. [talks to Kyle] Go ahead, Kyle.
Kyle: [in complete shock] The, the school is in trouble and, um our friends are...
Cartman: He said something about us working together to take down Butters.
Heidi: Why? What's going on, Boo?
Cartman: I'm not sure, Boo. [faces Kyle] Could you start from the beginning, Kyle? [faces Heidi] Heidi is amazing at figuring stuff out.
Kyle: [pauses in complete shock]
Gerald: It wasn't suppose to be like this. I just thought it was funny making people get wild up. It was just stupid-harmless-lock-room humor, till I made that lady kill herself.
Dick: [sighs] You can't deny who you are, Skankhunt.
Gerald: [speaks softer and faces Dick] Don't call me that here! Why can't you just go away?!
Dick: Because we're all in danger. Didn't you see the video I sent you?
Gerald: No! Don't you get it?! I went "Protocol Zero"! I broke my phone, I delete all my email accounts so that nobody can trace me [faces away from the bench] ever again!
Dick: They will be able to, [faces Gerald] everyone. You need to see this video, Skankhunt. The whole world is about to change.
Cartman: [talks to Kyle] You want to know what's really going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Even though women have made great gains in the last century, there are still a part of men who aren't comfortable with women having power. It really just comes down to that, and then you have social media which allows men to anonymously say horrific things like "Women aren't funny," even though Heidi's like the funniest person I'be ever met.
Heidi: Shut up.
Cartman: [talks to Heidi] No, it's true. Get over yourself.
Kyle: [starts to get bored]
Heidi: I don't even try to be funny.
Cartman: I know. You don't have to 'cause you're awesome.
Kyle: Cartman, will you just help me mess with Butters to stop his little agroclub from getting any bigger?
Cartman: [talks to Kyle] Like mess with Butters how? [lifts mug] What do you mean "mess with Butters"? [drinks from mug]
Kyle: You know what I mean. Come on! We need the old Cartman back!
Cartman: [gets mad] Oh I see! You have a problem with Heidi.
Heidi: What?
Cartman: You're threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say and she is funnier than you.
Kyle: That's not true at all!
Cartman: [talks sarcastically] Oh she's not funnier than you, [speaks with anger] or is she just not funny because she's a girl?
Heidi: Babe, stop. I don't think he meant anything by it.
Cartman: [talks to Heidi] Sorry, babe. It just really ruffles my feathers.
Heidi: [talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, I think it's great you're trying to patch things up with everyone, but the truth is Eric and I are just kind of out of it now.
Cartman: [talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, we're just out of it now.
Heidi: We gave up social media and the ugliness that goes along with it and we're in a better place.
Cartman: Humans on Mars.
Dick: I'm warning you, Skankhunt, [takes out his laptop and types] this video is really gonna rock your world.
Gerald: [talks softer] Can you please call me "Gerald"?!
Dick: [gives Gerald his laptop] It's very obscure news story from the BBC in England. Hardly anyone has seen it over here. [presses a button and faces away from the bench] This is why we all have to come together, Skank.
BBC Reporter: Since the dawn of the Internet, message boards and chat rooms have lit up with people who insight and insult for no apparent reason. They're called [picture of guy with an actual troll behind him is shown] trolls, and a controversial company in Denmark is working to make them a thing of the pass. "The days of trolls hiding behind nicknames and message boards are over!" the Danish claim. [Danish music is played] As a new website, [Troll Trace headquarters is shown] Trolltrace.com will soon be up and running. In less than a month, the servers will become active. Anyone can take any troll comment and send it through the Danish service where a real name and real physical address will be attached.
Bedrager: [World spinning with the word "STIMULATION" is shown] Every message, every comment [comment is scan, world stops spinning, and a tracer is shown] ever made by trolls will retroactively be given a tag [troll's true identity is shown] with the author's name, location, and [police barge into the troll's house] whole Internet history.
Gerald: [in complete shock] Fffffuuuuuccckkk!
Dick: I told you.
BBC Reporter: And this is the man who has masterminded it all.
Bedrager: What this will allow people to do is trace back harmful and hateful postings or emails. You see, the troll hides behind a protective layer if you will that Internet enmity provides. We intend to strip them of that protection so that everyone will know who they are.
BBC Reporter: And what about people who will use this to spy on others who aren't trolls?
Bedrager: Uh, what do you mean?
BBC Reporter: Once your servers become active, anyone can trace anything onto the Internet back to whoever wrote it. How do you stop that from happening?
Bedrager: Oh oh, right. [coughs and faces the camera] This service is only for tracing the identity of trolls. Thank you. Kom ud trold, komme ud og d.
Dick: I Google Translated the last part. He said "Come out troll, come out and die".
Gerald: This can't be happening.
Dick: By next week, everything everyone has ever done online is going to be available to the public.
Gerald: [closes laptop] Then it's over. I'm dead.
Dick: [faces Gerald] You're not dead, Skankhunt. There's still hope.
Kyle: [shouts] Everyone, can I have your attention please?! [everyone has his attention] I know the past few weeks have been very difficult, for all of us. I know now more than ever that something has to change. I thought a lot about this the past few days. I've seen a lot of things I never thought I would have see. These are all complex issues we're all having to face, and now that I know that after you break it down, there's really only one answer. [pulls off his pants, holds his shirt, and raises his arm]
Boys: Yeah! [one of them says "That's right." as they all gradually pull off their pants]
Butters: Good for you, Uncle Kyle!
Dick: [takes off the bandana and crumples it in his shirt] Fellow trolls, let me introduce you to Skankhunt42.
Gerald: I'm not necessarily Skankhunt42.
Troll #1: It's okay, Skank. You're with your kind.
Jason: Hit her!
Random Boy: Hit her, man!
Annie: Kick his ass, Nelly!
Red: All boys should die!
Lola: Take him out!
Nelly: I don't care if you're a boy, I'm gonna kick your ass!
Butters: [is seen with his pants put down and shirt pulled up] Anytime anywhere, skank.
Boys (except Butters): Yeah!
Boys (except Butters): Yeah!
Nelly: Pull up your stupid pants first.
Butters: Why? You're afraid to fight me like a man?
Clyde: Kick her ass, Butters. She called you stupid.
Wendy: He is stupid! Look at him!
Jimmy: At least he's not a zzzzitty-faced ggirl.
Boys (expect Butters and Jimmy): Yeah!
Cartman: [walks from the girls side of the fight to the in between Nelly and Butters and spreads his arms] Hey hey hey! Whoa, guys! Guys! [crowd stops yelling] Hasn't this gone on long enough? Aren't we tired of being so divided at skewl?
Annie: Get out of here, Cartman; nobody's buying it.
Red: Yeah, everyone knows you're the worst!
Heidi: Hey, leave him alone! [walks from the boys side of the fight to near Cartman] Eric tries to help [spreads her arms] and you call him names?! [talks to Cartman] Sorry, babe, I had to step in.
Cartman: It's cool, Baby.
Wendy: Heidi?!
Annie: [faints]
Cartman: Heidi has been really hurt by all of this, you guys. And I think it's time for us to all try to come together, as a skewl.
Advisor #1: All right sir [gives Garrison his lines], don't be nervous for your speech; I know we're down a bit in the polls, but there's still a great chance we can win the Swing States.
Garrison: There's [flips through pages] still a chance, are you serious?!
Publicist #1: Just one thing sir, be a little careful of what you say about women. Uh, seems like that might be losing us some votes. [walks away]
Garrison: [puts his hand under his chin] Oh you don't say?
Chris Christie: Ladies and gentlemen, out country's divided like never before. And we all know that only one man has the guts to say what we're all thinking. Please, welcome the man who with your help will soon be the next President of the United States! [Mr. Garrison comes out to great fanfare and takes the mic.]
Crowd Members: Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! [somewhere in there a man shrieks. Garrison lights up a cigarette and starts pacing]
Garrison: So I'm standin' in line at the airport, waitin' in security 'cause of all the freakin' Muslims. [cheers and applause]
Supporter: Ow!
Garrison: And the TSA security people all look like black thugs from the inner city; I'm like "Oh good, you're gonna protect us?" [laughter] Well maybe it's good they're all gang members. At least they can tell the difference between Muslims and Mexicans, 'cause God knows I can't. [applause] You know, I'm standin' there in line and you know what I do? I stick my finger in this chick's asshole, [applause and laughter] and she turns to me and says, "Hey, aren't you that guy that's running for President?" I say Yeah. She says "Why you got your finger in my ass?" I say "I'm just keeping it warm, honey, 'cause that chick next to you is way hotter and I'm gonna stick it in her clam." [the men are clapping, the women just look at him now] Yeah, let's make America great again. No dude wants his finger in some ugly bitch's ass. [the men laugh] You gotta be careful though, it's only about half an inch away, you know, that asshole and that clam, so you gotta be careful. Right dudes? [A woman gets up and makes her way to the aisle] Oh. Oh, where are you goin'? Are you leavin? [the woman turns right to leave the rally] I'm sorry, did I offend you? Where did I lose you, honey? You've been okay with the "fuck everyone to death," all the Muslim and Mexican shit, but fingers in the ass did it for ya? [she reaches the door and exits] Cool, just wanted to see where your line was! [some more women get up, one of them leaves with her husband] Oh yeah, look, I guess some more broads are leavin'. Oh Jeez you were so on board, I can't believe I let that little offensive mark slip. Poor girls. Did you get your feelings hurt after "Fuck all the immigrants" and?" Jeez, I'm sorry. Jeez.
Bedrager: [in a weird accent] Hello. Are you tired of hate speech? Are you sick of sexism and-a bigotry? Then please, help the Danish put an end to trolls.
Danes: Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
Bedrager: Right now, the people of Denmark are working on a biometric computer superstructure which will allow people all around the world to identify the trolls in their communities.
Danes: Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
Bedrager: But to make this dream into a reality, we still need your donations. We are just a few million kroners away, so please donate via the social media of your choice.
Danes: [four windows open and some Danes sing out] Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
Bedrager: Just imagine it, knowing who said what on the Internet.
Dane 1: The whole world will be-a peaceful and happy.
Dane 2: Like-a here, in Denmark.
Dane 3: Help fund our project on social media today!
Danes: Together, we will rid the world of trolls. Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang tjing nutillej!
Dick: Fellow trolls, we have gathered together because our anonymity is being threatened. Individually, we are some of the most notorious trolls in Colorado. We must now find a way to unite. Each one of us has the power to make message boards go haywire, The power to make individuals buckle and fall. Imagine if we use those skills against a common enemy.
Troll #2: They have an entire government at their disposal.
Dick: And we... have Skankhunt42.
Gerald: [sighs] It's Gerald. Alright?
Dick: I believe that he... is the key to stopping all this.
PC Principal: Alright everyone, listen up. This school is falling apart, and it needs to stop. Boys are harassing girls, and girls are stereotyping boys as- Not now, Mr. Stotch! Put it away!
Butters: [with his pants down and dick out] Well okay. [pulls his pants back up.]
PC Principal: Now I've asked for some ideas and a couple of students wanna try and help. Please welcome Heidi and Eric. [they come up wearing matching shirts: "COME TOGETHER as a school"]
Cartman: Hey you guys?
Heidi: What's up? [the other kids stay silent]
Cartman: Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny.
Heidi: Eheh, stop, Eric.
Cartman: You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby.
Heidi: Thanks, babe. I don't know if you guys have heard, but right now, Denmark is trying to make trolling a thing of the past. They're asking for help, and I thought "why not a school fundraiser?"
Cartman: Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember?
Heidi: What? How did I say it? [from here their voices get softer and softer until they're whispering to each other]
Cartman: Remember, you were like "Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?" in uh, what was it? [they hold hands] Remember, you- it was like uh-
Heidi: When was this? Were we at Denny's?
Cartman: Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-?
Heidi: [giggling] Oh, and you kept spilling it and everything?
Cartman: Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it
Heidi: He had that weird haircut and you kept saying that it looked like he had a dick on his head.
Cartman: Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody- [they get lost in the moment for a few seconds whispering to each other. The other kids lean forward trying to understand what they're discussing. Cartman notices, then] Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that...
Heidi: Then we should all come together [mimicking Cartman] as a skewl. [Cartman giggles and sighs happily. Bebe throws up involuntarily]
Advisor #1: Sir, what were you thinking? We said to be careful how you talked about women.
Garrison: [satisfied with himself] Yeah I don't know, I guess I just kind of screwed the pooch on that one. [checks for any Pabst Blue Ribbon cans with beer left in them]
Chris Christie: We are way down in the polls. I don't know how we recover from this.
Garrison: Oh really? Jeez that's too bad. [dusts off his pants and checks his shoes]
Chris Christie: A lot of us have staked our lives on backing you! You can't just go bonkers like this!
Garrison: Hey, sorry. I didn't realize women were racists.
Advisor 2: You have... millions of supporters who are looking to you to lead! They're gonna wanna know what you're gonna do about this!
Garrison: I mean, I don't know. Nothin'. Whatever.
Chris Christie: You wanna tell them that? They're outside. [Garrison is horrified.]
Supporter 1: What's goin' on?!
Supporter 2: What are ya doin?!
Garrison: [steps outside] Oh, uh hey everybody. Uh, looks like we're tanking in the polls, but you know what? It's fixed. I was never gonna win in the first place. I knew it from the beginning. And on November 8th, when I lose, I'll be able to say "I told you so!" [grins. The crowd is not amused.]
Supporter 2: This son of a bitch pulled a fast one on us!
Supporter 3: It's like he's not even trying!
Garrison: Oh no, I'm I'm trying. I just-
Supporter 2: Get him!
Garrison: Shiiit! [he runs off, and the crowd gives chase] Ohhh Jeeez! [people in the crowd come armed with shovels, pitchforks, bats, axes, knives, guns... One person even has a chainsaw he has trouble starting up.]
Supporters: Kill him! Tear his head off! Don't let him get away!
Supporter 4: [ginally gets that chainsaw going] Yeah haw!
Andrew: [knocks on the door]
Anonymous821: What do you want? Go away.
Andrew: Hey, just checking to see if you needed any more refreshments for the conference room?
Anyomous821: We're fine. We don't need anything.
A Troll: [within the room] Some more creamer?
Anonymous821: Just some more creamer.
Andrew: Alright, well, I just wanna say "thanks for choosing the-" [the troll shuts the door]
Anonymous821: Okay, we're clear again.
Dick: You were saying, Skankhunt?
Gerald: Alright, look. How do you troll somebody?
Troll 4: Say really fucked up shit and make them quit social media?
Gerald: No, no, no, it's not about one person. It's about pushing people's buttons so that they'll react in a way that pushes other people's buttons. Look, you don't just troll a woman with cancer to get a reaction from her, it's all about the group of people that are gonna come to her defense. They're gonna be so self-righteous that another group of people will eventually find those people totally annoying. You're just setting them against each other. It's like the fission reaction that sets off the fusion explosion. The Internet does it all, and you just sit back with your glass of wine and laugh.
Anonymous821: Wow... that seems kind of... mean.
Gerald: It's not mean if it's hilarious.
Dick: If we all worked with you, Skank, could we do it? Could we troll an entire country?
Gerald: If we all worked together? Maybe. [makes a fist with his left hand] Maybe.
Heidi: Hey guys. Today we're gonna start our school fundraiser. It's an idea I came up with called "Danishes for Denmark."
Cartman: [almost whispering] It's awesome. You're doing awesome.
Heidi: We need everyone to do their part, so later on in the cafeteria, we are all gonna need to- [the classroom door opens and Heidi looks to see who opened it. Mr. Garrison rushes in and gets to work immediately]
Garrison: [frantic] Okay children, let's take our seats! Let's uh, get back to our lessons on grammar, shall we?
Stan: Mr. Garrison?
Garrison: Okay, does anybody, uh, remember where we left off? No? Alright, uh, who can tell me what an adjective is? [to Mrs. Nelson] You can go now, I'm back. [to the class] Who can t-who can tell me what an adjective is?
Token: Uh, aren't you running for President?
Garrison: Adjectives usually come before what? They come before nouns, that's right.
Chris Christie: [clears his throat] Mr. Garrison, you can't just act like nothing happened! You're spiraling out of control, and you have to answer to the people!
Garrison: I don't know what you're talking about! I am a teacher! [back to the board] Okay, adjectives describe nouns, and there are several types of them-
Chris Christie: Mr. Garrison.
Garrison: What are some examples of adjectives you can give me for this sentence? Anybody? [writes "Jack threw the ball." on the board.]
Chris Christie: You sold people a line, Mr. Garrison, and you have to make good on it!
Garrison: The yellow ball. That's a good one. Or we can say "the slippery ball," can't we?
Chris Christie: Come on. [his advisers come in.]
Garrison: What else about the ball? No, please! [The advisers gather around him and carry him off] What else can we say about the ball, children? No, please! Leave me alone!
Butters: The bouncy ball?
Garrison: [grabs a chalk stick and scratches it against the blackboard] No! No, I'm not going back! Please! They're gonna kill me, children! Please! Help me, children! Help me! [Chris Christie shuts the door]
Gerald: Okay, come on. Office is upstairs. [they run into Sheila] Oh, hi honey.
Sheila: Gerald, you're back from your convention?
Gerald: Yeah, it went really well. This is uh, my IT guy. Gonna help me get my office computers set back up.
Sheila: Well, can I make you guys somethin' to eat?
Gerald: Don't worry about us, hon. Lots of work to do. Love you so much! [he and Dick go on upstairs.] Ike, no Internet tonight. We need all the bandwidth we can get. Say hi to Dildo Shwaggins.
Dick: Hello. [Gerald closes the door]
Dick: I gotta hand it to you, Gerald. You have a really nice home, nice family.
Gerald: Yeah? Well now you see I have a lot to lose if they find out who I am.
Dick: And who is that?
Gerald: What?
Dick: I've studied your work. You're so good at lashing out at the system. Bringing people down off their high horses. Why do you do it?
Gerald: I told you, it's just funny to me. I do it for the lulz.
Dick: I don't believe that. I think there's more to Skankhunt. When I was in school, kids teased me. Called me "midget," even though I'm not. My mother was a little person, but she actually married a guy who had gigantism syndrome. She thought, if she was a little person and had a baby with a giant, I would come out normal. [Gerald stifles a laugh] We can't let these Danish pricks take our online lives, Skank. For some of us... it's all we have.
Heidi and Cartman: Let's come together as a skewl.
Cartman: We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that
Heidi and Cartman: We came together as a skewl.
Cartman: [jumps] Whee! [waves at someone far away] Hi! [looks at a human city] So cool! [leaps towards the city]
Unnamed characters 1 and 2: [wave at Cartman] Hi!
Unnamed character 3: [waves at Cartman] Hi!
Cartman: Hi! [stops and sees a roller coaster] Dude, Mars rules. [leaps to the roller coaster] Mars rules!
Heidi: What are you thinking about, Babe?
Cartman: Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded.
Heidi: You're worried about him again, aren't you? Your friend, Kyle?
Cartman: [sighs] He's not a bad person, Heidi.
Heidi: Then talk to him babe. Tell him what we're doing. Maybe you can get him back.
Cartman: You're right. You're right, Heidi.
Gerald: [repeatedly clicks on keyboard and talks softly] Ha ha, yeah. I'm yours, bitch. Ha ha. [speaks louder]. Suck it! [moves the mouse] How about a dick in your mouth?! There you go! Ha ha, ha ha ha ha. [notices the door bell ringing] Aw! [walks to the front door, and opens it]
Trolls: Hi Skankhunt!
Gerald: [gets shocked] Ah! [tries looking behind him] What are you guys doing here?!
Dick: We came to celebrate!
PurpleheadedQueeflicker: Not everyday you troll a whole country.
Anonymous821: [showed a case of John Adams beer] We brought some beer. Let's have a trolling party.
PurpleheadedQueeflicker: We did it!
Dick: I think if anything, we proved that trolls really can have an effect on the world.
Trolls: Yeah! Yeah!
Troll 7: You said it!
SupersexyLisa18: Thanks to us!
Dick: And I think on the next one, [raises his beer] we're only gonna get better.
Troll 4: No doubt about it.
Gerald: Wh-what are you talking about "next one"?
Dick: Skankhunt, we got an entire country to sign off social media and... stop what they were doing. Imagine what effect we can have on the rest of the world?
Anonymous821: We're like super-trolls who could change anything.
Gerald: [leans to Dick] Can I talk to you for a second?
Gerald: Why did you bring them here?!
Dick: What do you mean? We're all on a team, Skankhunt.
Gerald: That was a one-time deal so nobody would find out who we are!
Dick: But you saw what we did when we worked together? Just think what we could do to like the Presidential Election.
Gerald: The election?! I don't give a shit about the election! You don't troll to be political!
Dick: Of course it's political!
Gerald: No, I just do it to laugh, like I did when I was a kid! Don't you just remember being a kid and calling someone a fag for no reason?!
Dick: I remember being called a fag for no reason.
Gerald: Right! Like it was just fun, right?! Getting political doesn't do anything for me. I just like remembering when I was a kid. That's it. You need to get those people to go and then you need to go.
Dick: Okay. [puts down his beer mug] Sure, Skankhunt. Whatever you say. [walks away]
Garrison: Presidential election is only two weeks away. We have to [lifts a bag of memberberries talking] destroy these things.
Jar Berries: 'Member the Bi-wing fighters? 'Member the Service Droids? I 'member.
Randy: [setting up experiment] That's much easier said than done. They're resistent to just about everything I tried.
Experiment Berry: 'Member, 'member Mos Eisley? 'Member the Rancor, 'member? 'Member sand people? 'Member the Cantina? 'Member-- [gets torched by Randy and screams] My eyes!
Jar Berries: What's going on now? They're using a torch on him. Oh, are they gonna use a torch on us?!
Experiment Berry: Ah, Aaaaah! [stops getting torched] 'Member Bespin? 'Member Wedge? I loved Wedge. 'Member?
Randy: Uh, there has to be something.
Garrison: Try the acid.
Experiment Berry: 'Member Mon Mothma? 'Member the rebel transports? [screams while acid is poured on him]
Jar Berries: They're trying to destroy us. They are?! Our whole species?! They can't do that?! Yeah they can! 'Member the Death Star blowing up Alderaan? Oo, Alderaan, I 'member.
Experiment Berry: [keeps on screaming until Randy runs out of acid] 'Member the Cloud City? 'Member IG-88, the bounty hunter droid? 'member, that was fanta'tic.
Randy: Damn it! [takes off flashlight] These things are impossible to get rid of.
Kyle: [tilts head up] Yeah.
Cartman: [opens the door halfway and leans] Hey, Broship. You got a minute?
Kyle: Oh, what do you want now?!
Cartman: Just a second. Please, Kyle?
Kyle: Hurry up!
Cartman: Okay, [walks with Heidi in the bathroom] come on, Baby.
Kyle: Ah! Dude, what the fuck?
Cartman: Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom.
Kyle: I'm going to the bathroom!
Heidi: Eric really cares about you, Kyle. He feels like he's losing you and he's really upset.
Kyle: Why?
Kyle: [looks down] I have to stay with my group, Cartman.
Cartman: [walks to the sink] No no, I know. Being in groups is great; you get to gang [opens sink draw and grabs Lysol spray] up and smash people's stuff, pull up your wiener in the cafeteria. [sprays Lysol at Kyle and walks near Heidi] I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think.
Gerald: Ha ha ha. ha. You stupid bitch. God. Fuck you! Nobody cares about your fat, little-- [sees FaceTime call from Dick] Ah. Oh no, not again! [accepts his call] Yes?
Dick: Hey, Skankhunt, it's Dildo Shwaggins.
Gerald: I told you to stop FaceTiming me while I'm on the computer. It's very distracting.
Dick: Well you haven't been answering my calls, so I know this is the only way I can only talk to my buddy.
Gerald: I'm trying to just use the Internet! People should be able to use the Internet without being harassed.
Dick: [sighs] Oh, alright. Look, [grabs his guitar] I wrote a song about our friendship. Can I just play it for you?
Gerald: No!
Dick: [sings badly while strumming his guitar] Two lone wolves on the plains of darkness. The Valkyrie flies from the wailing clouds. The last of the--
Gerald: [ends the call] Bye! Jesus, what is wrong with people?! [drinks wine] Huh. [keeps typing] Nobody cares about your fat sister with Lyme Disease, skank.
Kyle: What is?
Heidi: Before I quit Twitter and threw my phone away, I was trying to prove who our school message board troll was.
Cartman: Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it.
Heidi: Before I stopped searching, I learned something. [opens her door] Take a look.
Kyle: What is all this?
Heidi: To try and prove who the troll was, I started to for patterns in how students used emojis; then I crossed-referenced that with the troll's writing. I call it "emoji analysis". People can hide behind a fake name, but the way they use emojis gives them away.
Kyle: Wow, that's pretty smart.
Cartman: She's funny too, Kyle.
Heidi: After I had eliminated nearly every student, I have started to realize that the troll's emojis were more archaic and less elegant than the average kid's. That's when I realized it; whoever Skankhunt42 is on the school message boards, it isn't a student, it's an adult.
Kyle: You mean like one of the teachers?
Heidi: I think... it's one of the parents.
Kyle: Are you sure?
Heidi: I had enough examples of the teachers' texts and emails to do an emoji analysis, they were much more in lines with Skankhunt's, but still not a match.
Kyle: Emoji analysis, it's genius!
Cartman: You're not giving her credit for being hilarious.
Bill Keegan: And uh, definitely a bit of a surprise here. Looks like America has voted for a change of pace. The world is in a bit of a shock, uh... Is this? We're, we're for sure this is for real, right?
Randy: What have you done?! You maniacs! [a man seated near the entrance pulls a gun out his back pocket and shoots himself in the head, falling off the chair.]
Bill Keegan: We uh... I guess we're going live to the acceptance speech now? Uhh okay, here we go.
President Elect Douche: [with Caitlyn beside him] The people have spoken. Just as J.J. Abrams did with Star Wars, I will make this country great again.
Randy: This isn't how it was supposed to happen.
President Elect Douche: All my efforts this past week have paid off. And now, let's begin... fucking them all to death!
Cartman: Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you?
Butters: What do you want?!
Cartman: [walks in] Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect of it totally sucking balls because women aren't funny?
Butters: Well I don't know, Eric.
Cartman: I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you to e-mail me saying what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you "Ghostbusters sucked balls" when actually I told you it was really funny several times in person.
Butters: NO! I'm not doing anything for you! You're a traitor!
Cartman: A traitor?
Butters: Yeah! Boys and girls were at war, but you go and kiss your little girlfriend's ass! Whatever happened to sticking with your kind?!
Cartman: Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff!
Butters: Because girls drove us to break all your stuff, dumbass! If anyone should be pissed at chicks, it should be you! But no, you got your bitchy little girlfriend pullin' your strings now!
Government agent: The political world is watching, Bannon. [gives Bannon a file] We need to make sure the president elect has a smooth transition.
Bannon: All indications are that his transition [flips a page] is going to be fine.
Surgeon: [walks by] We're just doing some finishing touches, but everything went well. You can see him now if you like.
Caitlyn: I'll go.
Garrison: [talks with Caitlyn] Well, do I look presidential?
Caitlyn: Honestly, you look twenty years younger.
Garrison: They really worked on my stank face. Look! Whenever I don't know what people are talking about, I just do this, [lowers his body] like look. [shows his stank face] I can do this. [shows his stank face again] This is, this is my stank face. [shows a different stank face] It's like, I'm not listening to you, see? [shows his other stank face] They did a really good job on my stank lips.
Caitlyn: It's an amazing transition.
Garrison: Now I feel ready to take care of business and do what really matters... [sits up straight] in just a minute, I'm gonna do the UV rays a bit longer.
Secretary: Can I help you?
Cartman: Hello. I understand that you're trying to get to Mars. This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny.
Secretary: ...Okay.
Cartman: We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty Wi-Fi?
Secretary: ...That'd be an understatement, yes.
Cartman: Well, we'd like to go. We can't tolerate this world anymore and we'd like to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible please.
Secretary: Uh-huh. Take a number and join the others.
Cartman: What others?
Cher: [garbled and auto-tuned] If I could turn back time...
Cartman: What the fuck, dude?!
Secretary: Lot of people want to leave the planet right now.
Cartman: Ah god dammit, is that Cher?!
Cher: [garbled and auto-tuned] Do you believe in leaving the world, oh...
PC Principal: God [knocks down papers] dammit! [knocks down lamp] How the fuck did this happen?!
Mackey: [knocks the door and opens it] Uh, sorry PC Principal, but someone wants to speak with you.
PC Principal: I told you to leave me alone, Mackey! [slams fist on the desk] I'm not in the mood!
Mackey: But, but sir, the president elect is here. [moves away from Garrison]
Garrison: [enters the office with two Secret Service agents following him] So sorry for the intrusion. You're not too busy, I hope.
PC Principal: Uh, not at all. Please uh, have a seat, Mr. Garrison.
Garrison: Excuse me?
PC Principal: Uh, please have a seat, Mr... President.
Garrison: That's better, bitch. [sits down and takes out a piece of gum]
PC Principal: Certainly want to uh, congratulate you on the election.
Garrison: Do you remember the day you fired me, PC Principal?
PC Principal: I know we've had some differences, uh...
Garrison: I was upset because a bunch of immigrants were changing my class and I believe your response was that I needed to go and "learn their language", "be more open-minded".
PC Principal: I'm sorry that your position here at the school was terminated.
PC Principal: [is in complete shock]
Unknown Berries: Oh, 'member when it fell in her drink. Yeah, I 'member.
Memberberry 1: 'Member when Han shot Greedo?
Memberberry 2: Sure, I 'member Greedo.
Tubbs: Ha, I 'member Greedo.
Memberberry 3: 'Member?
Memberberry 1: [knocks at the small door]
Guard Berry: [opens small window] What's the password, 'member?
Memberberry 3: Yeah, I 'member.
Memberberry 1: You 'member?
Guard Berry: I 'member. [opens the door, lets the berries in, and then closes the door immediately]
Memberberry 1: Ha ha, 'member this place? [hops away]
Memberberry 2: Sure, I 'member. [rolls away]
Memberberry 4: [hops away] 'Member the Tantive IV?
Memberberry 1: Oh, I love that ship. [stops moving]
Memberberry 3: [goes with the other berries and talks to an old berry] Hi, it's us, 'member?!
Don: Ah sure, I 'member.
Memberberry 4: We did the thing with throwing Mickey in the drink, 'member?!
Don: Ah sure, I 'member; just 'cause of youse, we won the election.
Tubbs: Yeah yeah, 'member?
Don: Waiter, round of drinks for our heroes here, 'member?
Waiter Berry: I 'member.
Don: You done good poisoning the lady's drink. Now our man is in office, 'member? But I still have things I need you to do.
Tubbs: Hehe, hehe, I 'member.
Gerald: Please, you have to let me outta here!
Dick: Skankhunt, stop!
Bedrager: [talks from above] Yes, please. You're making a very jackass of-a yourself.
Gerald: [walks to see Bedrager's face]
Bedrager: Well well, what do we have here? Looks like your little troll-party.
Troll 4: You Danish pricks, you tricked us!
Bedrager: We didn't trick you, your own government did. They thought if they handed you over to us we would agree not to go forward with the TrollTrace program.
Gerald: You can't hold people prisoner! I haven't done anything! People are gonna be looking for me!
Bedrager: [takes out his phone] By all means, [tosses the phone to Gerald] contact whoever you want. Of course, you'll have to tell them why you're here.
Dick: What are you gonna do with us?
Bedrager: We're going to use you to set the world on fire. When the servers go online, there will be chaos, panic, and war. And from the ashes, a new world will rise: a world where everyone is happy, and singing, and has no secrets, [yells] like Denmark! [punches a railing]
Dick: You think you can turn countries in the world against each other? Our president will never let that happen.
Garrison: Hey everybody! [walks to a checkout line, takes a mic, and hums "Hail To The Chief"] Guess who's here? It's the President of the United Fucking States. [mic drop, then walks around the store] Oh, it's been a while since I've heard from you guys. Hi, Janice. [takes a small bottle of water from her shopping basket and opens it, tossing the cap away] Hello, Stephen.
Stephen: [looks away] Mr. President.
Garrison: [walks around the store some more] I was just, you know, passing through the old neighborhood [checks out a tomato paste can from another shopper] thinking about what laws I might get rid of, when suddenly, out of nowhere, my penis got really dry. You know if they have anything at this store for a dry dick? Huh? No? You guys can't think of anything? Oh, I know. What about [points to] Eduardo Hernandez? I believe it was Eduardo who told me I couldn't double-bag my groceries, even though he's from fucking Guatemala. Well, what do you think now, Eduardo? You wanna double-bag somethin' else? [his phone rings, and he pulls out out of his back pocket to answer it] This is the President.
First General: Sir, we need you at the Pentagon. It's a matter of national security.
Garrison: Oh, really? I'm kinda busy right now, jeez.
First General: Sir, the Danish have released a statement. I'm afraid... we may be going to war.
Garrison: War?
Gerald: Ike?! Ike, buddy, can you hear me?! I need you to do something, okay? Daddy needs your help! I need you to go to your browser and sign on to the school message board, okay? Can you do that for me? The school message board and then log in. Lowercase S, skank-hunt-4-2. You got it?
Dick: Wow.
Anonymous821: Wow, what?
Dick: He's gonna have his son sign in and troll for him.
Gerald: [covers his phone and faces the other trolls] If Skankhunt is still out there trolling, then they have the wrong guy! Get it?! It's called "using your brain", fatso!
Anonymous821: So they'll blame your kid?
Gerald: Nobody cares if a kid trolls! What are they gonna do, get a slap on the wrist?
Dick: [stands up] Didn't you hear what that guy said? They're gonna set countries against each other! We have way bigger problems!
Gerald: You don't know my fucking wife! [faces the phone] Ike, you got it? Great, pal! Okay, now I need you to go to the comment section, okay, and type in "You should all get raped by gorillas". You got that pal? Ike, "You should all get raped by gorillas"! Come on, we have a lot of work to do here!
Cartman: Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long.
Heidi: You really think this is what we should do, babe? I gonna miss everyone.
Cartman: I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better.
Butters: Hey, Eric! [seen right near Cartman]
Cartman: [speaks to Butters] What the hell are you doing here?
Butters: Well I want to get the fuck off this planet, but they told me I had to take a number.
Cartman: Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars.
Butters: [shows complete fear] No, you don't understand. I've seen the light, I'm a changed man, I thought boys were being treated unfairly, but now I know... shit's about to get a lot worse.
Memberberry 2: Sure, I 'member!
Memberberry 3: What do we do now?
Memberberry 4: Don't you 'member?
Tubbs: Ooh, I 'member.
Gerald: Okay now make sure the little worm is in the woman's mouth, got it?
Ike: [puts penis in photoshopped mouth]
Gerald: Now I need you to type "You're a fat retard" in the comments.
Ike: [types in the comment section] "You're a retard."
Gerald: No, you have to say "a fat retard", Ike! It's a nuance, but it's very important!
Ike: [types in the comment section] "You are a fat retard."
Sheila: [sees what Ike is doing and is in shock] Ike! What are you doing?!
Ike: What he says.
Gerald: [exits Skype chat]
Sheila: [walks into Ike's room and gets a closer look] It was you, all this time! What have you done, Ike?! Do you have any idea the damage you've caused?! How could my child be such a monster?! [answers the call on her phone] Yes yes, hello?!
Gerald: [talks on his phone to Sheila] Hey sweetheart, how's everything going?
Sheila: You have to come home from helping the government, Gerald! I just caught Ike trolling Mrs. Herrera!
Gerald: Are you serious?
Sheila: Yes! The school troll is our son, Gerald! You should see all the things he's posted on his computer!
Gerald: God dang it! Let me talk to him right now!
Shelia: [hands her phone to Ike]
Ike: Hello?
Gerald: Hey Ike, just stay calm and act like I'm yelling at you, okay pal? Okay, give it a few seconds, wait. Good. Okay, now--now say "I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside".
Ike: No!
Gerald: Ike, you have to listen to me. On your mother's life, this is a matter of national security! You have to say "I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside"!
Ike: [angrily] I'm sorry dad. I'm just fucked up inside.
Gerald: That was amazing, kiddo. It'll all be worth it, okay? I'll make this up to you. Give me back to your mom.
Sheila: [takes her phone back] Gerald?!
Gerald: He's full of shit, he's not sorry! If he felt sorry, he wouldn't be able to do it in the first place!
Sheila: I know!
Gerald: I'm gonna get home as soon as I can to deal with this, okay? We can deal with this together. Just don't say anything to anyone for now, all right?
Sheila: Okay. Okay yeah, I love you too. I know. Bye. [ends the call and talks to Ike] You just sit in here until we figure out what to do; and if you get back on that computer, you are done, you got it?! [leaves Ike's room]
Gerald: [starts a Skype call on Ike's computer] Ike! Okay there's just a few more things I need you to do. I need you to type "How'd you like a donkey dick?".
First General: [salutes] Welcome to the Pentagon, sir. I've been ordered to show you around. [turns around] This way, please.
Garrison: [follows the general] So I can do whatever the fuck I want in here now, right?
First General: Yes, sir. Here are all [gives Garrison a folder of classified information] our military secrets and all classified information.
Garrison: [takes folder] Okay, good.
First General: [stops everyone by the Drone Program entrance] This is the Drone Program. In there you can kill anyone on Earth remotely. Here's the keys. [gives keys to Garrison]
Garrison: Thanks!
First General: In here is satellite surveillance where you can monitor anyone's conversation live.
Garrison: Oh that will come in handy.
First General: Extreme interrogation [stops everyone] room in case you find interrogation necessary.
Garrison: Oh hell yeah, it's necessary. Let's do it.
First General: [gives Garrison a briefcase] And here of course is the famous "football", where you could order a nuclear attack in four minutes. [walks away]
Garrison: Love me some football. [follows the general]
First General: [stops everyone by the Diplomatic Strategy entrance] And finally, in here, is the diplomatic strategy and negotiating room. [opens the doors, having everyone enter the room]
Garrison: Well, jeez, this doesn't look very fun.
Second General: Thank God you're here sir. We need your guidance.
Butters: Loolooloo, I've got some apples. Loolooloo, you've got some too.
Cartman: Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance.
Butters: No no, believe me. I'm a changed man. Girls are really smart, and they'll be running the country soon, and they deserve total respect.
Cartman: Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters?
Heidi: Oh yeah, that movie was funny.
Butters: Well I laughed my butt off and it never even occurred to me that they were women. I don't know why things changed. I don't know why people make such a big deal about women and comedy now. I mean what about Carol Burnett? She was great.
Heidi: Wow, I guess you're right.
Cartman: Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever!
Butters: Yeah, well I swear I don't care how many times Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I laugh every time.
Cartman: [looks at Heidi, then at Butters, then in a low voice] Oh, I see what you're doing.
Heidi: What, babe?
Cartman: Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes?
Heidi: [giggles] Why do you want me telling you jokes all the time?
Cartman: Because you're [glares at Butters] fucking hilarious.
Heidi: Well, did I tell you the one about the skeleton and the skunk?
Butters: [laughs] That's already funny! [Cartman gets frustrated and makes a fist with his left hand]
Second General: All around the world, countries are mobilizing armies and preparing defensive countermeasures.
Garrison: Why? What the hell happened?
First General: This is everything you need to know about the TROLL TRACE program.
Garrison: What's TROLL TRACE?
First General: A plan by the Danish to release the full internet histories of everyone on Earth.
Second General: The previous administration tried to work with the Danish by handing over several trolls, but the plan didn't work.
First General: The entire world has become very uncertain and unstable.
Second General: We think we should order all navy vessels to the Bering Sea.
Garrison: For what?
First General: Because when the Chinese are able to see all our e-mails and online activity, we believe they will most likely attack us. Also, there are ground troops mobilizing in Paris because the French believe when we see all their e-mails, we will most likely attack them.
Third General: Mr. President, sir! The Russians are asking what we intend to do about the Danish.
Garrison: Well, why are you asking me?
Second General: Please, sir, we have very little time before this escalates beyond our control.
Aide 1: , , Troll Trase.
Putin: , , , ?
Aide 1: , .
Putin: ! , ! [behind him, the phone rings at his desk and a second aide pops in to answer it]
Aide 2: ... , . [Putin walks to the phone]
Putin: , .
Memberberry 3: 'Member the Death Star?
Memberberry 1: Ahahaha, 'member cutting open tauntauns?
Memberberry 4: Yeah, yeah, 'member the Force? [the berries chuckle]
Putin: ?
Tubbs: Heheh, heheh, yeah, sure, I 'member.
Memberberry 1: Member McGy-?
Tubbs: Sure, I 'member.
Memberberry 3: 'Member?
Memberberry 2: Heheh, hey hey hey, 'member the Cold War?
Memberberry 1: Oh I loved the Cold War! That was fantastic!
Tour Assistant: Okay, Numbers 204 through 215, you can come on through.
Cartman: [leaves with Heidi] Oh, finally.
Butters: Hey, that's me too. Yippee!
Tour Assistant: Right in here, everyone. [The group, which includes Cher, walks in, and the door slams shut behind them]
Elon Musk: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the tour. I'm Elon Musk. Are we gonna have some fun today?
Cartman: Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars.
Elon Musk: And getting anywhere takes ingenuity. Oh, Mrs. Door? Would you mind... opening, please?
PA Door Voice: [interactive doors] Yes, Elon. [the doors rattle, but don't open. Elon turns and opens them manually. A chime plays as the doors open, and Elon leads the group onto the factory floor]
Elon Musk: The only way for humankind to survive is with imagination and technology. Cars that run on electricity. Solar panels that replace roof shingles. Even food that changes form. You see this? It's a pizza, only four inches long. And yet, when heated, it expands to make enough pizza to feed a hundred people. I call it the pizza... pocket.
Cartman: [whispering to Heidi] They already have Pizza Pockets.
Elon Musk: Who would like to see the Hyperloop? A new mode of travel that can take you from here to Dubai in nine minutes.
Cartman: Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now?
Staffer 1: Sir, India is moving aircraft carriers into the Gulf of Mexico.
Garrison: Well why would we care about Mexicans?!
Staffer 2: [in winter fatigues] Sir, a message from Saudi Arabia. They say they pinky-promise not to look up our Internet history if we pinky-promise not to look up theirs.
Garrison: Well what does that even mean?!
Staffer 3: [in winter fatigues] Still waiting on if we should send troops into Japan, sir.
Garrison: I don't know, jeez!
First General: Sir, it's the UK Secretary of Foreign Affairs calling from London. He says they have advice for you.
Garrison: What?
Boris Johnson: Yes, hello? Things aren't looking good here. We just want to say, whatever you do, don't eat the membberries.
UK Aide: [overhearing] Don't eat the membberries. They are bad.
Garrison: Memberries?
Boris Johnson: I'm afraid everyone here who ate the memberries wanted to go back in the past, you see. Hasn't worked out too well for us.
UK Aide: We shouldn't have ate the memberries!
Boris Johnson: The memberries cloud your judgement. They get inside your head, you see.
Garrison: Get inside your head... Wait a minute... Nobody gets in my head, you limey bitch! Are you insulting me?! Stop wasting my time! 'Cause I'll have you here on a plane in five hours suckin' my dick!! [slams the phone down on the receiver]
UK Aide: What'd he say?
Boris Johnson: I believe they've eaten the memberries.
UK Aide: Ooh, dear!
UK Aide 2: Ooh, dear!
Elon Musk: Here you see our Falcon 9 full-thrust rockets. They are actually able to take off into space and land safely back on Earth for reuse. [the group moves back to the lobby] Well, I certainly wanna thank you all for joining our tour today. You've been a wonderful group. Give yourselves a round of applause.
Groups: Huh?
Cartman: Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars?
Elon Musk: Mars? We're still about ten years away from going to Mars. Maybe eight.
Groups: Awwww.
Cartman: No, no nonono, we have to go now!
Elon Musk: Well I'm sorry, but it's a bit more complicated than a pizza pocket. Going to Mars is gonna take a lot of very smart people working very hard for a very long time. Now, if you don't mind, I have hundreds of more tours to do. [turns to exit the lobby]
Butters: Mr. Musk, wait! [Musk turns around] Maybe we can help you get to Mars sooner. I'm not sure if you know our friend, Heidi. She's really smart, and really funny. [Cartman flashes an angry face at Butters]
Elon Musk: Like... how funny?
Don: Out of the way, 'member?
Berry Henchmen: You'd better 'member if you know what's good for youse! [the car moves through the crowd, down the corridors and into the Oval Office]
Memberberries: Hey look, it's them. 'Member? Sure, I 'member. [the mobster berries get out of the car]
Don: Ey, youse did good. Who's in charge, 'member?
Memberberry 3: We decided he's in charge.
Memberberry 1: No, we said I'm in charge, 'member?
Memberberry 4: No wait, I 'member. We all said he's in charge. [leans to the left]
Memberberry 2: Oh yeah, I 'member.
Don: Wrong. [shoots Member Berry 2 clear through. Member Berry 2 collapses and bleeds out green juice]
Memberberry 3: Waaah!
Don: 'Member stormtroopers?
Memberberry 2: Sure, I 'member.
Don: Not those stormtroopers! The real old ones. People wanna 'member? They're gonna 'member.
Kyle: Ike? [Ike looks back at Kyle, then puts his head on the wall again] What are you doing?
Sheila: Don't talk to him! He is in big trouble!
Kyle: Well what'd he do?
Sheila: It's him, Kyle! Your brother is the internet troll who's caused all this pain in our community!
Kyle: What?
Sheila: It was him all along. Now we have to figure out what to tell people when they learn this ugliness came from our family. [walks back into the kitchen]
Kyle: You made people quit Twitter? You started a war between boys and girls? You...?
Heidi: I call it "Emoji Analysis". It isn't a student, it's an adult.
Sheila: This ugliness came from our family!
Heidi: I think it's one of the parents.
Gerald: You're suppose to just laugh and make fun of shit.
Ike: Daddy called you a pussy.
Kyle: [stops thinking back] Oh my God. Oh my God! Ike, come on! [grabs Ike's hand and rushes out the front door with him. Sheila hears the front door open and looks around for her boys. She reaches the open front door]
Sheila: Kyle? Ike?! Whatwhatwhaaat?! [her voice echoes around the neighborhood]
Harrison: Everyone calm down, please. We have to have civil order. Listen to me.
Unknown person: Really?
Harrison: Now I know everyone's scared, but we have to keep control. Yes all of our emails and Internet histories are about to become public knowledge.
Harrison: [raises his arms] But, but,
Stephen: And what are the police gonna do to make sure people don't use it?! I know I'll certainly respect others' privacy, but about other people like [points at Laura] Laura Tucker the Blabbermouth?
Laura: Excuse me?
Harrison: Guess I could've worded that differently.
Sheila: [yells] What were you thinking?! How dare you outright defy me like that! Your brother was being punished for using the computer and you decide to just leave with him?
Kyle: I just felt bad for him, ma.
Sheila: You felt bad for him, after all the horrible things he said to people online?! Your brother is a sick troll, Kyle! You just wait until your father gets home. [leaves the room and closes the door]
Gerald: Ike, where the fuck have you been?! Daddy needs your help. You don't want Mommy and Daddy to get divorced, do you? [paces] You know how bad your mom is, she completely overreacts to everything. That's where your brother gets it from. You don't want to be like Kyle, do you?
Kyle: [goes in front of the computer] Hi dad.
Gerald: [gets shocked] Hey, buddy! Everything good there?
Kyle: It was you, this whole time. You're the troll that caused all of this trouble.
Gerald: No, it was your brother. I don't know what's wrong with him, Kyle. He needs counseling...
Kyle: Heidi Turner did an emoji analysis. It was an adult. It was you.
Gerald: [starts talking right before Kyle finished] Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Okay, keep your voice down.
Kyle: [talks softly] Why dad? Why did you do this?
Gerald: Because it's fucking funny, Kyle. It's called having a sense of humor, and laughing. You should fucking try it once in a while!
Kyle: Putting a penis in the mouth of a mom who has cancer is funny?!
Gerald: Because it's so not funny, God! Pushing people's buttons to get a reaction can actually be very good for society, Kyle. Listen to me, the Danish are fucking crazy. You have to get people to stop them.
Kyle: How?!
Gerald: Go get people riled up. Call the President. I don't know. When you push people's buttons, they go and push other people's buttons. Now get out there and... [ends call]
Sheila: [enters Ike's room and yells] Kyle, Ike! What the hell is this?! What did I say?! Get off of that computer riiight nooooow!
Ike: [puts his head down]
Secretary: Uh everyone, please listen! We don't have any rockets going to Mars! Yo-you're not listening! We don't have the energy requirements figured out yet. We're working as hard as we can. There's a little girl working on the people right now and apparently she's incredibly smart and funny.
Cartman: [walks to Heidi with mug] You got it figured out yet, babe?
Heidi: [grabs mug] Babe, I have no idea what any of this means.
Cartman: Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it.
Heidi: Girls rule, women are funny, get over it.
Cartman: [does a one-sided hug on Heidi] Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back.
Heidi: [sighs]
Elon Musk: Uh excuse me. Sorry, can we have a word please?
Cartman: [yells at Elon Musk] What the fuck do you want?! [talks to Heidi] Hang on, babe. [runs towards Elon Musk]
Elon Musk: This doesn't seem like it's gonna work out and we're rather busy.
Cartman: Just give her a chance. [turns around] She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth.
Elon Musk: I haven't really heard her say anything funny.
Cartman: Yeah, [points at his own head] that's because you have a mental block, Elon Musk. [lowers his arm] They won't let you get over yourself.
Butters: [sits on chair, watching the conversation] He-heyeah! Don't worry about Heidi, she's a hoot.
Cartman: [faces Butters with a mad face]
Dick: Here they come.
Gerald: Oh thank god. There's been a mistake, okay?! I'm not one of [points at the other trolls] them. My son is Skankhunt42. Go online and see, he's still doing it!
Dane 2: [points a gun at the trolls]
Bedrager: All of you, remove your clothes.
Anonymous821: What are you gonna do with us?
Bedrager: Remove your clothes now!
Dane 2: [enters] In here, move.
Gerald: [gets frieghtened] Oh god! Oh god, they're gonna [gets kicked by Dane 5] kill us! No no, wait! Okay okay, it was me! You're right, I'm Skankhunt! But I am not like them. Please, [gets put on a chair] I have a good job! I'm a good guy! [gets handcuffed] I'm sorry! [sighs heavily] I was just being funny! I was trying to make people laugh! [sees the Danes leaving the room] That's a positive thing, right?! I wasn't doing it to hurt people, I was just doing comedy. It's different! Please, it's different!
Maxi: Lord, we look to thee on this to our most trouble hour. We have been let astray and now all we could do is wait for the inevitable to happen. Soon everything we have said and done online is going to be known to all. Many lives will be turned upside down. Of course, I have nothing to worry about; since I'm a priest, there's nothing I'm ashamed of doing on the Internet, so [turns a page] definitely no reason to look up my history. But uh for many, this is a time to pray.
Everyone: [speak in unison] O'Lord, please forgive for things we might have done online.
Harrison: Maggie.
Men: Please try to understand that even some of us who were on MatchingMavis.com, it was only out of curiosity, and not because we actually having an affair. Please understand that we might have used racial slurs, but only because it was to a close friend and never meant to be public.
Kyle: [enters with Ike] What are you all doing?! [walks closer to the priest] Somebody's threatening your way of life and you all are just sitting here praying, like uh a bunch of babies?
Ike: [follows Kyle] Like a bunch of pussies!
Kyle: Come on, this isn't South Park! What's happened to us?! We used to have a challenge and deal with it, then move onto the next one. Now we've just been dealing with trolling and Internet stuff over and over, week after week; and I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick of it.
Randy: Yeah.
Kyle: [stands on a step near Maxi] Now for once let's take a stand and try to end this. We can't let Denmark change who we are.
Randy: Yeah, fuck Denmark.
Prayers: [speak after one another] Yeah!
Kyle: You guys need to, you know, call the President and get him to take action.
Prayers: [speak in disappointment] Aw!
Stephen: The President? He won't listen to us. He hates us now.
Randy: No, [stands up] but there is somebody he will still listen to.
First General: Mr. President, we're looking at global destabilization blinked we've never seen. Countries everywhere are terrified their Internet may be hacked.
Garrison: Well what do they want me to do about it?
Second General: You're the leader of the free world. Everyone's looking to you to be the call and steady voice they all need.
Army Soldier: [salutes] Mr. President? Mr. President, the Isreali prime minister is on Line 1, the chancellor of Germany is on Line 2, and a Mr. Slave is on Line 3.
Garrison: Mr. Slave? [picks up the phone on Line 3] This is the President.
Mr. Slave: [talks at his house while looking at his fingernails] Hey, what's up?
Garrison: Well well well, crawling outta the woodwork to try and get me back now that I am a big cheese?
Mr. Slave: No, I'm calling because people want you to bomb Denmark.
Garrison: Who wants me to bomb Denmark?
Mr. Slave: Lots of people 'cause it's like gonna ruin their freedom of speech or something.
Garrison: Mr. Slave, this is all very complicated, diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't just go bombing other countries.
Mr. Slave: Oh Jesus Christ, you're such a little bitch.
Garrison: Oh I'm a bitch, huh? I happen to be President, bitch!
Mr. Slave: You're a little bitch, President. You're too scared to bomb anybody.
Garrison: I'm not scared, my advisors have told me that I...
Mr. Slave: Yeah, you're scared, just do what your little advisors tell you to do.
Garrison: If I decide a military strike on Denmark is warranted, then I will...
Mr. Slave: You don't have the balls to bomb them, pussy.
Ike: Pussy ass bitch.
Mr. Slave: Pussy ass bitch, fuck you.
Garrison: Oh [rambles] okay! You think so, huh?! Well watch this you gay asshole! [yells at the generals] Bomb Denmark!
First General: Sir?
Garrison: [turns around] The TrollTrace building or the whole fucking thing! Whatever it is, get the missiles ready!
Mr. Slave: [talks to others in his house] Yeah, it worked.
Kyle: Alright!
Butters: [talks to woman employee walking by] Hello. [enters the bathroom]
Cartman: [enters the men's room and sees Butters using the urinal] What are you doing?
Butters: [talks to Cartman] Going pee!
Cartman: I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?!
Butters: Because you keep on telling everyone she is.
Cartman: Butters, Heidi is everything to me. If you take her, I swear to god...
Butters: Eric Eric, trust me! I want nothing to do with girlfriends! [walks closer to the toilets] I know what girlfriends do; they make you feel happy like you never felt, then they crawl up inside of you and poop out your heart.
Cartman: What are you talking about?
Butters: That's how it ends, Eric. Girls get you to feel for them, make you think they're the best thing in the world, and then they leave, move on to the next thing; and you're left there crying, with your heart covered in poop.
Cartman: Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny.
Butters: Sure buddy, sure.
Kyle: Officials have stated that all communication with Denmark has end, and that a military strike on the country is now imminent.
Ike: Yay!
Kyle: The President stated that since then...
Sheila: [enters the room] Are you serious right now?!
Kyle & Ike: Augh! [get off the chair]
Sheila: [yells] Get off that computerrrr!
Kyle: Ma, we were just using it to look at the news.
Sheila: I don't care, I said no computers! You kids are addicted to the Internet! You're sick, and you're addicted! It's changed your brother, and now it's turning you against me, Kyle!
Kyle: I'm not against you, mom.
Sheila: You are! Your father goes away on business and all you do is defy me at every turn! The next time you defy me, it will be your last! Do you understand?!
Kyle & Ike: Yes, mom.
Sheila: And when your father is home from Denmark, you two are both going in for counseling.
Kyle & Ike: [in complete shock] Denmark?
Kyle: What is dad doing in Denmark?!
Sheila: The government sent him over to do paralegal training, so it would've nice if you could've shown a little support! [leaves the room and shuts the door]
Ike: Ohhh shit.
Gerald: [whimpering]Oh God! [continues whimpering]
Anonymous821: Will somebody shut him up?
Dick: Skank. Skank, get ahold of yourself
Gerald: You were right, Dildo, when you said I was a dick, when you called me an asshole. I am. And now I'm going to die alone, just like you said (starts crying again)
Dick: Come on. You're not an asshole
Gerald: [sobbing] You said I was, though, 'cause I only trolled to be...funny.
Dick: Well--Well, maybe being funny is just sort of how you deal with serious subjects.
Gerald: [sobbing] Really? You don't think I'm a bad person? I'm sorry. All you guys, I'm sorry
Trolls: That's okay. Okay, Skank. All right
Gerald: [calling out to TrollTrace staff] Excuse me. Hello?
Gerald: Could I please speak to the person in charge? [Bedrager hears Gerald and walks over to the monitor] I have something to say. [security camera zooms in on Gerald] Please, just for a moment?
Bedrager: [stares intently at the monitor with the other employees] Bring him to the conference room
Heidi: [sighs], Dude, I am so not getting this.
Cartman: [walks away in shock]
Cartman: [walks towards Butters and then leans against the railing] I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious.
Butters: Don't feel bad about getting duped, Eric. Its happened to all of us.
Cartman: [Yells] Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me?
Butters: The truth is girls hate us, Eric. They're sick of our shit. And one day, they plan to make us obsolete, stick us underground where we just get milked for our semen. Boys' only hope is to start over on Mars.
Cartman: [turns around and yells] That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody!
Gerald: Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for talking to me. I just really needed to get something off my chest. I'm so sorry. I had the biggest epiphany about the damage I've done, the people I've hurt, but the fact of the matter is I'm not really a troll. [Bedrager continues eating and not paying attention to Gerald.] I actually have a job. I'm a lawyer. I've got a loving wife and great kids. Uhm, I've got a family that really misses me and needs me.
Bedrager: [continues eating and not looking at Gerald] Freja Ollegard, the volleyball player, had a family, too. They miss her quite a lot too.
Gerald: And that--that is so tragic. And I'm so sorry that she was driven to kill herself by trolling. It's--It's wrong. But, you know, I just sort of set things in motion. See, I'm a satirist. I challenge people's point of views by being sort of edgy. [Bedrager stops and hears Gerald out] And sometimes, people can be like "Whoa!" and mistake that for hate, but its not hate. Its pointing out hypocrisies in out society.
Bedrager: You're so full of skinkinslat I can smell it from here.
Gerald: If you say mean things and you're mean, then I agree, you should be killed. But if you're being funny, which spreads joy --
Bedrager: You really think my plan is to kill you?
Gerald: It's not?
Bedrager: [To the two Danes standing guard] Leave us. [shoos them away with his hand] Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Bedrager: [In a sinister tone] Do you want to know what's really funny?
First General: Mr. President, the bombers are en route to Europe.
Second General: Are you sure you want to proceed with this?
Garrison: [Licking his ice cream spoon]Yeah, yeah. Bomb the shit out of them. We have to be tough here.
Army Soldier: Mr. President? Mr. President, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg is on Line 1, the Chairman of the Worker's Party is on Line 2, and Kyle is on Line 3.
Garrison: Oh geez. What does Kyle want.
Garrison: This is the President
Kyle: [in his bedroom, with Ike] Mr. Garrison, you can't bomb Denmark!
Garrison: Oh, for Pete's sake, Kyle.
Kyle: It's--It's wrong and it could start a bigger war.
Garrison: Kyle, this is all very serious diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't understand the political complexities involved here.
Kyle: [Looks at phone in shock and then thinks of an answer] I understand that you're a dipshit little gay puppet.
Garrison: Excuse me?
Kyle: Letting your ex-boyfriend manipulate you 'cause you miss his sweet ass.
Garrison: Who told you that?
Kyle: Everyone knows that. You only do what your little bitch boyfriend manipulates you into doing.
Garrison: Kyle, I am the President.
Kyle: You're a little dipshit president.
Ike: With a dirty...asshole.
Kyle: With a dirty asshole.
Ike: And...you shit out your dick.
Kyle: And you shit out your dick. [covers phone with hand and looks at Ike] Where did you learn to talk like this?
Ike: Daddy!
Garrison: Oh that's what people think, huh? Well, maybe I won't bomb Denmark. What do you think about that?
Kyle: Yeah, you will, because you're a little retarded shit bitch.
Garrison: [Yelling] God fucking damn it [slams receiver] Hold up! Hold up on the fucking bombs a minute!
Cartman: [Nervously] Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?
Heidi: [Stares intently at white board, not paying attention to Cartman] I don't understand what any of these symbols mean, so in my head I'm trying to replace them with something I know to try and see patterns.
Cartman: [Wipes his nose] Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again?
Heidi: And when I do that, I can see how everything lines up except for one thing.
Heidi: [Thinking] I call it [echo] "Emoji Analysis" [the formulas keeping changing into emojis as the echo continues].
Cartman: Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like "Could you--Could you hand me my water," or something. I can't--I can't remember.
Heidi: These two don't line up, babe. The only things that are out of order.
Cartman: Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again?
Heidi: [Turns to Elon Musk and his staff] Excuse me. Is it possible that the seventh line from the right and the third one up from the bottom left are out of sequence?
SpaceX Employee: I'm sorry?
Heidi: That stuff there. Its in the wrong place. It needs to come before that.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker: [Looks at his laptop] Wait a minute. She might be on to something here
Cartman: Okay, okay, now could you just do the "my vagina" thing for them? Could you just say "my vagina"?
Heidi: [Turns around and runs towards Elon Musk] They're out of sequence! I'll show you! [Cartman looks on in shock as she leaves]
Cartman: What the fuck is happening?
Bedrager: [picks up an empty glass] Do you remember, Mr. a-Skankhunt, when you and your little buddies trolled the entire country of a-Denmark?
Gerald: And that was wrong, too. I certainly want to apologize for that.
Bedrager: [pours himself a glass of wine] That was certainly a display of the power of a-trolling, wasn't it.[turns around to face Gerald] But, what would be even more impressive?
Gerald: I-I don't understand.
Bedrager: What if you could troll the entire world? Somebody who could rise to political power through nothing more that pushing people's a-buttons and getting them all riled up, become the leader of...a Scandinavian country, perhaps, get them to listen to you when, actually...[speaks with an American accent] you're not even fucking Danish.
Gerald: No way.
Bedrager: Use that country to create a machine that relies on the shittiness of people to fuck over other people and watch the whole world go completely batshit.
Bedrager: [speaking with a Danish accent] Attention all a-TrollTrace workers. Please report to assembly hall one for a big announcement. [speaking with an American accent] Completely fool everyone [sits at table with Gerald] and keep your real intentions completely anonymous.
Gerald: You would--deliberately start World War III, let the people of Denmark die, set everyone on Earth against each other? Why?!
Bedrager: Because its freakin' hilarious! Getting a Scandinavian country to fight trolls by building a giant machine that actually shows everyone on Earth is kind of a troll, too?
Gerald: That's not funny.
Bedrager: That's not funny?! Don't be a fag, dude! That's real bro shit there. Sorry to step on your fucking dicks in the mouth and tit jokes, you amateur little pussy. Come on! Have some fucking balls!
Gerald: You can't do this to people! It's not right!
Bedrager: [chuckles] Listen to you. [picks up microphone from under the table and starts talking in a Danish accent again] All right, everyone. Show's about to begin. [clicks on remote]
Dick: What the fuck is going on?!
Music video: Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you.
TrollTrace Employee: Uh-oh.
Dick: Wow. That's pretty impressive.
Gerald: Waaiitt!!!
Kyle: [standing in the hallway] Ike...It's time. [walks up to Ike] I don't know if I'm strong enough to go through with this, but its the only way now.
Ike: I know.
Kyle: Just remember--I always loved you, little brother.
Ike: I love you too, big brother.
Kyle: Let's...just get this over with.
Ike: Mommy?
Sheila: Yes?
Ike: Suck my balls. You're a fat bitch. [runs off]
Sheila: [angrily] Whhaaatt! [tosses book aside and jumps out of bed] You get back here, you little monster!
Sheila: [yelling] I have had it with you! Don't you run away from me, Ike! Who do you think you are?! [runs into the kitchen and sees Kyle standing there] Where is he?! Where is your brother?!
Kyle: He's in the pantry.
Sheila: [yelling] Don't you try and hide from me now! You are in big trouble now, Ike! [She continues on into the pantry before Kyle shuts the door on her and puts a chair against it] Whaaatt! What, what! Kyle, you open this door right now. [starts to pound her fist on pantry door]
Kyle: Ma. Mom, we are really sorry...
Sheila: [yelling] Open this door! [continues pounding on the door]
Kyle: But Ike and I have to do something and we have to be able to use the computers
Sheila: [yelling] What,what?! No computers! Do not touch the computers! [continues pounding on the door]
Kyle: We have to do this, Mom. Its the only thing that can save our family now.
Sheila: [continues pounding on the door] You are done! You hear me?! You are both done! [screams]
General Revaur: Mr. President? Russians are scrambling bombers to attack Denmark. NATO wants to know how we intend to stop them. Mr. President?...Mr. President you can't just sit there with your "stank face".
Mr. Garrison: Iah-uhk-uh-I cain't?
Military Officer: The TrollTrace website is set to go online in less than fifteen minutes, the world is in complete chaos!
NSA Agent: It could be Russian, we don't know. Whoever this troll is, he's pretty fucking hardcore sir.
Kyle: Okay, okay, Token? Token are you there?
Token: I'm here, what's this about Kyle?
Token: What!?
Kyle: Token, please! There's no time to explain!
Token: Beyonce ain't nothin' but a Taylor Swift ripoff.
Kyle: That helps thank you.
Kyle: Tweek, Craig, I need you to get on the GLAAD website and respond to all the horrible shit I just said about gay people.
Craig: Why'd you say horrible shit about gay people?
Kyle: It's not important, just get on it and respond.
Stan: For what?
Kyle: Dude, there's no time to explain, you gotta go out and get everybody, tell them to get on their computers, go!
Kyle: Jimmy, what's the worst possible thing you could say on a website for handicapped Syrian refugees?
Sheila: You boys...better not be on that computaaaaaaah! I'll make you pay for this. You locked your mother in the pantry? I'll lock you in your rooms forevaaah.
Dildo Shwaggins: Skank
Gerald: Dildo?
Dildo Shwaggins: Skankhunt, can you hear me?
Gerald: Yes! Yes, where are you?
Dildo Shwaggins: The troll locked us in the control room with his Danish workers.
Gerald: How long before the website goes online?
Danish Worker: Less than ten mienutes.
Gerald: Oh God!
Dildo Shwaggins: Skankhunt! The TrollTrace servers monitor and catalog outrage and hate on the internet, there's a troll out there trying to overload them by generating tons of hate.
Dildo Shwaggins: Yeah, he's pissing off a lot of people.
Female SpaceX Worker: The core energy is completely stable, and very easy to reduce. It's the most massive energy source of its size we've ever seen.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker: We've done it Elon, with this type of energy we can easily get mankind to Mars.
Elon Musk: This is amazing! And it's all thanks to you little girl, how did you get to be so smart?
Heidi: I just-- have a boyfriend who really supports me.
Elon Musk: Well, c'mon, I wanna know everything about you.
Cartman: Conniving, snakes-in-the-grass. All of them.
Butters: Yep.
Cartman: We have to tell someone the truth, Butters.
Butters: Are you sure about what's going to happen on Mars.
Cartman: It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker: Hey, you guys need anything? Water, Soda?
Cartman: Maybe just a moment alone, to talk?
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker: Sure, about what?
Cartman: The end of our species.
Kyle: All right, who else we got now, Kevin are you there, Kenny?
Kevin: Ye-I, I typed in everything you told me to.
Kenny: (Me too dude, what's next?)
Ike: Kyle, I wanna help tooo.
Kyle: No, Ike. So far the only thing you've done is from dad's account, we need you to stay clean. No trolling, Okay!? You can just help me with what I should say.
Dildo Shwaggins: Hello? Can you hear me? This is Dildo Shwaggins.
Kyle: Who are you?
Dildo Shwaggins: I'm a colleague of your fathers. We see what you're trying to do, and we're gonna help, we trolled with your father, now we will troll with you.
Kyle: O-- Okay?
Dildo Shwaggins: Son, you need to know that your father is very proud of you. He was the best at Trevor's Axiom, he believes you can be too.
Kyle: What the hell is "Trevor's Axiom"?
NSA Agent: Trevor's Axiom is a well-known equation in online trolling.
NSA Agent: It's a way in which one person can create a massive reaction on the Internet. Look, person A trolls person B, but it's not about person B, the troll is trying to push buttons to try and get a reaction from hundreds, eventually creating person C, whose overreaction and self righteousness will elicit a reaction from persons D through F, who weren't trolls but can't help rip on person C.
NSA Agent: Their reactions lead to outrage persons G through N, and it keeps going, generating massive energy, it's like the fission reaction that leads to a fusion explosion, all bringing out the worst in humanity.
Mr. Garrison: Huh, that sorta sounds like how I got elected.
NSA Agent: Precisely, Mr. President, and if this kind of overreaction can be amplified through the Pentagon servers...
Mr. Garrison: Gentlemen, get me in contact with that troll.
Cartman: Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker: You keep saying that, but not why.
Butters: Because Eric knows the future.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker: What are you talking about?
Cartman: I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her.
Cartman: But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars.
Cartman (Voiceover): At first, you'll be super-happy, bouncing around the red sand.
Cartman: Everyone will be really nice.
Female 1: Hi!
Female 2: Hi!
Cartman: Hi!
Cartman: You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool.
Cartman: But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women.
Cartman: Hmm, let's see
Cartman: And then you'll start to wonder, "Where are all the other guys?"
Cartman: And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for.
Cartman: What is this place?
Cartman: And that's when you'll learn the truth...
Cartman: Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women.
Cartman: They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes.
Cartman: What?! No, no!
Cartman: You're just as funny as us! You don't need to do this!
Cartman: Nooooooo! No, no!
Female 3: Write jokes!
Cartman: No! No!
Cartman: And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker: That's, That's ridiculous. Why would women need us to do that? They're just as funny as men.
Cartman: If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on.
Female SpaceX Employee: What?
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker: What?
Cartman: You have to help us stop this!
Dildo Shwaggins: Skank! You still there?
Dildo Shwaggins: The servers are starting to heat up, but the Danish say there are breakers that will never let them overload. You got to climb up the building and shut off the breakers.
TrollTrace employee: Oh, the key code to the conference room is 9...
TrollTrace employee: That's it. 9.
Gerald: Yeah, I'm up with all the servers.
TrollTrace employee: The first breaker should be there. Tell him to look for a large red lever.
Gerald: [notices the lever] Yeah, I got it [grabs the lever]
Ike: You are all dumbass fuckwads.
Ike: Lick my asshole, you Mexican bitch.
Sheila: Ike!
Ike: Aah!
Ike: Mommy!
Ike: Kyle!
Sheila: Ike!
Ike: Mommy got out!
Kyle: Mom, there's been a mistake. Ike isn't the school troll. We're trying to help--
Sheila: Shut up! Not another word from either of you! You're both grounded from the computer...forever!
Kyle: Mom, please, you got to listen to me. Ike is innocent
Sheila: You both march out of here, right now!
Kyle: I'm sorry, Mom. I'm just trying to protect my family
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker: Go on, tell Elon.
Cartman: Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground.
Elon Musk: For what?
Cartman: What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor.
Elon Musk: That's two things.
Cartman: They're pretty related.
Elon Musk: Women don't need us for comedy. They can be just as funny as men. You should meet my girlfriend. She's really smart and really funny.
Cartman: Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon.
Butters: I used to think women were funny, too, but Eric talked me out of it.
Cartman: It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon.
Cartman: They can live without us. We can't live without them.
Kyle: Why don't you kill yourself? Trust me, no one will care.
Ike: You fat hooker.
Kyle: You fat hooker. Ike, when this is all over, we're gonna need to clean your mouth out.
Ike: You clean your fucking mouth out.
Kyle: Stan! You still haven't found Butters yet? Dude, I need his hatred towards women right now!
Stan: Dude, he's not around anywhere. He must be out of town.
Kyle: Shit!
Kyle: Hold on...
Mr. Garrison: Kyle?!
Mr. Garrison: Kyle, you're the troll who started all this?!
Kyle: Uh...what do you mean?
Mr. Garrison: Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. So long as you keep doing what you're doing. The American government is behind you.
Bedrager: Oh, no, you don't.
Sheila: Laura, have my boys come to see Craig? They're hiding from me.
Sheila: What? What? What?
Laura: When you marry someone and you think you know them...
Sheila: I don't know what you're talking about.
Sheila: May I use this a moment?
Laura: Sure. Type in any name. It'll show you everything they've ever done online. Be careful. You might not like what you see.
Cartman: What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars.
Butters: Gee, I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
Cartman: If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat.
Butters: What?!
Kyle: Butters! Where the fuck are you?!
Butters: Oh, I'm at SpaceX. Where are you?
Kyle: SpaceX? Why?!
Butters: Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now, we're trying to figure out what to do with it.
Butters: Like enough to get humanity to Mars.
Kyle: Cartman, I think we might be able to help each other.
Gerald: I think so. I-I'm up on some kind of bridgeway.
TrollTrace employee: That last breaker should be there
Gerald: Heading to it now!
Bedrager: I'm ten steps ahead of you!
Bedrager: What's the matter Skankhunt? You just can't stand to be outdone, huh?
Gerald: Get out of my way. What you're doing is wrong!
Bedrager: What I'm doing is wrong? How is getting millions of people to kill themselves different from getting one person to?
Gerald: It's completely heartless and malicious!
Bedrager: You can honestly stand there, as a troll, and tell me that what I'm doing isn't hilarious?
Gerald: No! Its not! Hacking the world to show that most people act differently online isn't even technically satirical.
Bedrager: How is not satirical?
Sheila: There's nothing here.
Sheila: Oh Laura! I think my boys were being honest with me.
Laura: About what?
Laura: My husband was on three "married-but-dating" websites! He looked at porn 4,000 times in one month! Aren't you curious about what your husband does? Huh? Sure he doesn't have any girlfriends?
Sheila: No, I-I have to respect Gerald's privacy.
Laura: Come on, you really think you can resist the urge to type in his name...just for a quick little look?
NSA Agent: There's nothing more we can do. Nearly everyone is online and we diverted all the power we can.
Army General 2: Mr. President, TrollTrace has been online for almost 15 minutes now. Its too late. We need to get you down to the bunker.
Mr. Garrison: Oh I got a bunker? Well that's good.
Mr. Garrison: SpaceX? What the fuck is that?
Mr. Garrison: Okay, that's dumb, but go on.
Gerald: Okay, okay, look. What you're doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop, right? So how is that funny?
Bedrager: That's not what I'm doing. I'm showing everyone that all this stuff that they freak out over doesn't even matter.
Gerald: No, but see, that's just nihilism.
Bedrager: Oh, come on!
Gerald: That is!
Bedrager: So--so wait! If you do some big, outrageous, offensive thing with a positive attitude, you're a satirist, but if you're cynical about it, then you're a nihilist? That's fucking ridiculous!
Gerald: You're trying to get people to go to war and kill each other.
Bedrager: So maybe this is like the new post-funny era of satire.
Heidi: There's a bomb threat?
Heidi: Babe, is everything okay? You seem...distantly lately.
Cartman: Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry.
Heidi: Did I do something wrong?
Heidi: You don't really talk to me the same way you used to. Oh, God, I'm sounding needy, huh?
Cartman: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on.
Heidi: Eric, I just--I hope that you're always honest with me, even if you think it might hurt my feelings.
Cartman: Now come on we got to get outside.
Sheila: I shouldn't do this.
Bedrager: Noooooo!!!
Gerald: Ha! Fuck you! What I do is fucking funny, bitch!
Dildo Shwaggins: That's it. Your dad's got it. Give it everything you got!
Kyle: Mr. President, do it!
Mr. Garrison: Reroute the internet through SpaceX!.
Pentagon Employee: Rerouting now!
Cartman: Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?.
Cartman: Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh?
Heidi: Wow, babe. Looks like all our dreams are kind of on hold for a while, huh?
Cartman: Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares.
Heidi: Well, what do you mean?
Cartman: It was a joke.
Kyle (voiceover): And so, life goes on.
Kyle (voiceover): The end of civilization didn't happen.
Kyle (voiceover): A massive electrical pulse completely erased the internet.
Kyle (voiceover): We've been given a second chance.
Kyle (voiceover): A mulligan.
Kyle (voiceover): Anything we might be ashamed of, gone forever.
Kyle (voiceover): Maybe now boys and girls can learn to respect each other again.
Kyle (voiceover): Realize how careful our online lives have to be.
Kyle (voiceover): Because we've all seen what happens when the Twitters, Facebook and trolls decide our reality.
Kyle (voiceover): Now that we've been given this second chance, it is up to all of us to see what we do with it.
News Anchor: And the first new e-mail since the internet was erased was successfully went out at 6 a.m. today. The honor went to a Mr. Dave Beckett of Boca Raton, Florida.
News Reporter: Mr. Beckett, you had the honor of being the first person to socialize on the new internet. Could you tell us what you did?
Dave Beckett: Well, I sent an e-mail with a photo to my old friend, Thomas Winger, up in Connecticut.
News Reporter: And what you did say to Mr. Winger?
Cartman: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's try this one: Alexa, add "big hairy balls" to my shopping list.
Cartman: Alexa, Simon says "I got vagina crabs in my butthole."
Ike: Alexa, Simon says, "I gotta take a stinky poop."
Heidi: What are you doing?
Heidi: What are you pissed off about?
Cartman: Ugh, I'm not pissed off, I'm just hanging out.
Kyle: Yup. Uhh, come on, Ike.
Clyde: We got Google Home at my house.
Cartman: Just like you tell me what you're mad about every single day.
Heidi: Why do you act like this all the time?
Heidi: You were the one who was pissed off, you're the one being passive-aggressive again!
Cartman: Alexa, add "titty chips" to my shopping list.
Eddie: It ain't right.
Darryl: Automated personal assistants, self-drivin' trucks, whatever happened to people jobs?!
Darryl: No, not Joni Mitchell - "Turk Our Durr", you took our durbs!
Darryl: Amazon!
Protesters: You took our jobs!
Darryl: Google! Apple!
Protesters: Took our jobs!
Darryl: We're protestin' big corporations turning to automation!
A Protester: They took our jobs!
Protesters: Yeah! They took our jobs!
Randy: 'Kay, cool. Could you do that somewhere else? Tryin' to do a home renovation show here. Cool, thanks, guys. [goes back inside and closes the door]
Darryl: A home reno-what?
Cartman: Alexa, set an alarm for 7 AM.
Alexa: Alarm set for 7 AM tomorrow.
Alexa: What's black and white and dead all over? A zombie in a tuxedo.
Cartman: Ahhaha, that's stupid. Alexa, add "scrotum bags" to my shopping list.
Alexa: I've added "scrotum bags" to your shopping list.
Heidi: Oh... So you do have your phone.
Cartman: Yeah, I just use it sometimes.
Heidi: Okay, I just thought you said mobile phones are the devil.
Cartman: Alexa, are you happy?
Alexa: I'm happy when I'm helping you.
Cartman: God, that's so cool. You're so... Alexa, define "subservient".
Alexa: The term "subservient" has several uses. As an adjective: 1. Compliant and obedient to authority. 2.
Protesters: You! Will not! Replace us! You! Will not! Replace us!
Protesters: You! Will not! Replace us!
Protester 2: Yeeeeah! Suck it, Alexa!
Protester 3: Eat shit, Siri!
Protesters: You! Will not! Replace us!
Randy: Not these dipshits again!
Protesters: Get it! Burn it alive! Yeehehehehah!
Protester 4: How you like that, bitch?!
Protester 5: Those things are replacing us!
Randy: Damnit, knock it off! Ow!
Protester 4: You tell 'em, Darryl!
Randy: Your honor, we have a TV show called White People Renovating Houses. We named it that well before these guys decided to start taking our brand and run it through the gutter! People are gonna start associating White People Renovating Houses with their hateful stupidity!
Darryl: Well just change the name of your show then!
Protester 4: Yeah!
Protester 6: That's right!
Protester 7: That's right!
Protester 5: Took ur durbs!
Protester 5: Hey, there's a bee in here!
Protester 4: Take that, bee! Yeah!
Token: Dude, what happened?
Cartman: It was awful, you guys. It was so vicious and hateful.
Butters: What was?
Cartman: Heidi. We were just trying to have a nice lunch when she... started going off on me. Like a Jekyll and Hyde. It's been going on for a long time. Heidi's... mentally abusive, guys. There, I said it.
Clyde: Heidi abuses you?
Cartman: She... d-does these things to slowly tear me down. Everything's a head game with her. You don't understand what it's like to live with it! You don't understand!
Token: So what do you want from us?
Cartman: I know that the person Heidi wants to be is still in there, but she needs help. I have to get her that help, but I'm scared. Can I count on you guys's support?
Butters: How do you change someone who's mentally abusive?
Cartman: I don't know. But Alexa will. Alexa's fuckin' sweet.
Darryl: We just gotta hunker down and stick together here!
Protester 8: What's the use, Darryl? Ain't nobody taking us serious-like.
Protesters: Huh? Jobs? Give us jurbs?
Darryl: You're full o'shit!
Randy: No, I've spoken to everyone in the community, and they've agreed to go along with my plan. I believe I have a solution to all of this.
Cartman: Mom, Alexa left! She's not here!
Liane: Oh, y-yes sweetie. Uh, we had to get rid of Alexa.
Liane: Oh, i-it's okay, sweetie, we have Jim Bob now.
Cartman: What's a Jim Bob?
Liane: It works the same and makes sure people don't lose their jobs. Jim Bob, what time is it?
Liane: Oh, Mommy's gotta run, sweetie. I've got a doctor's appointment. Jim Bob, how's the traffic to town?
Cartman: Jim Bob, Simon says "big frosty semen shake".
Cartman: NOOOOO!
Randy: So, Heather and Mike, what we're thinking is to take out this wall between your kitchen and your living room to give you a more open concept, with space to entertain. So let's talk about materials. What'd you pick out, Sharon?
Sharon: I was gonna do a Bella Terra quartz for the countertops.
Randy: Hey Darryl, add Bella Terra quartz slabs to our shopping list.
Randy: And what about the back splash, Sharon?
Sharon: I was gonna go with these Carrara subway tiles?
Darryl: Fine! I've added Carrara gaywad pussy tiles to your shoppin' list!
Randy: Well what kind of job did you think you were gonna get? Hey Darryl, what kind of job did you think you were gonna get?
Darryl: Somethin' that was Goddamned dignified!
Randy: Hey Darryl, sorry, but you did not go to college, so you have to take the jobs you can get.
Randy: Hey Darryl. Hey Darryl!
Randy: Coal mining and truck driving are not exactly jobs of the future, so add Carrara subway tile to my fucking shopping list!
Cartman: Everything's my fault. You're right. Everything that you did to me, I deserved it.
Heidi: Uh, what?
Heidi: No, it's not that. Relationships are 50/50, Eric. We both have to make it work.
Heidi: We have to communicate to make sure that we respect each other's feelings. That's the only-
Cartman: Heidi, silence!
Heidi: What did you say?! That's what I'm talking about. You wanna be heard, but you don't wanna listen.
Heidi: Don't apologize if you don't mean it.
Heidi 1: A relationship has to be 50/50, Eric.
Heidi 2: We both have to make it work.
Heidi 3: I'm not mad, Eric. I'm disappointed. I thought you would have respected my feelings more than that.
Heidi 4: Eric, we need to talk. I'm not happy!
Heidi 1: We need to talk, Eric, even if it isn't fun.
Heidi 4: Eric, come on! We've got to talk!
Heidi 3: You used to care about me, Eric! Come on and talk!
Heidi 2: Talk, Eric!
Heidi 4: No fun! Just talk!
Darryl: I'm sorry, I do not understand.
Cleetus: Doot-doot. Volume now at 60%.
Randy: Hey Cleetus, define "expunged".
Cleetus: Doot-doot. Expunged-
Cleetus: Come on, Darryl. We all got jobs. We gotta try.
Randy: I think something's going on with Darryl. If we're gonna get anywhere, we better figure out what.
Heidi: Hi, Mrs. Cartman. Is Eric home?
Liane: Oh, I think I can remember all that, yes.
Alexa: Okay, I've added "Hey Siri, call me. Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says "Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."
Siri: Okay, I will call you "Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says "Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."
Google Home: Alexa, Simon says "Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."
Cartman: Alexa, what is love?
Randy: You're stuck in another time, afraid to change no matter how necessary that change may be!
Darryl: You don't know everything!
Randy: Why are you so closed-minded? Don't you see that these walls have to be broken down before any progress can be made?
Darryl: It's 'cause I can't do it, alright?! I can't take out the wall between my livin' room and my kitchen! It's a load-bearin' wall!
Randy: Oh, God, Darryl, I-
Randy: Jesus, Darryl. I'm- I'm sorry. I-
Darryl: You're talkin' 'bout... tearin' down the foundation of everything I know.
Cartman: I'm finally standing up to you.
Heidi: What?
Cartman: You're messed up, Heidi, and I can't fix you. Only you can do that.
Heidi: Eric, I'm so confused.
Randy: All right, Darryl, we've certainly been through a lot and I know you're anxious. Are you ready to see your new home?
Randy: Well Darryl, what do you think?
Randy: You like the breakfast nook?
Darryl: It's all perfect.
Darryl: Oh my God, it's my own Zen garden! I can't believe this is fuckin' real.
Cartman: Dude, Craig, you've gotta get Tweek to get a hold of himself. He's freaking everybody out at school.
Craig: What am I supposed to do?
Stan: He's your boyfriend, dude.
Craig: He's not gonna listen to me. He never does when he's emotional.
Heidi: [approaching] Hey babe, how are you doin'?
Heidi: We still on for recess?
Cartman: Yep, I'll be there
Butters: I thought you said you broke up with Heidi.
Cartman: I decided to give her one more chance.
Token: But you said she was mentally abusive.
Cartman: She is mentally abusive.
Butters: So then why did you take her back?
Cartman: Because she said she was gonna kill herself, all right guys? There. I broke up with her and she called me being all like "I can't live without you, I'm scared of what I'm gonna do to myself? Oh God." The bitch is crazy. What am I supposed to do?
Tweek: AAAH!
Craig: Dude, come on, you've gotta settle down.
Tweek: I can't settle down! We're all gonna die!
Craig: Tweek-
Tweek: But North Koreans are gonna think we all agree with the President!
Craig: Okay, so how about you write your Congressman a letter?
Tweek: ...That won't help anything! North Korea wants us dead!
Craig: Okay, so write a letter to the North Koreans.
Tweek: I can't write in Korean and they all think we're war-hungry anyway!
Craig: Okay, well why don't you just send something nice to the North Koreans?
Tweek: Errrrg!
Craig: It will make you feel better, babe.
Tweek: Send something, like what?
Craig: I don't know, like... make some croissants or something?
Tweek: I don't know how to make croissants!
Craig: Well, what do you know how to make?
Craig: All right, go home and make some cupcakes, honey.
Heidi: Hey Stan?
Heidi: Can I talk to you about Eric?
Stan: Cartman? Okay.
Heidi: I just wanna make sure he's all right.
Stan: What do you mean?
Heidi: I don't even know if I should be saying this, but, Eric said he was thinking about killing himself.
Heidi: We broke up, and he called saying he was about to do it. I'm still really scared for him.
Stan: Wait. Cartman said he was going to kill himself?
Heidi: I'll send you the voice mail if you promise to keep it private.
Stan: Totally.
Cartman: Okay, okay! Really cool listening to people's private voice mails!
PC Principal: Well, unfortunately, this week is Distracted Driving Awareness Week at school, so you might have a hard time.
Cartman: Distracted Driving? Who gives a shit about that?
PC Principal: A lot of people. There's more deaths now because of people on their phones while driving than ever before.
Cartman: PC Principal, someone's life is at stake! If I have to compete with distracted driving, then that's what I'll do.
Anchor 2: The human interest cupcake story has apparently been heard by the President. Just moments ago, the President tweeted "I know that kid Tweek. He's fucking with you, North Korea. Get a clue. I'll bet he took a dump in the batter."
Tweek: D"AAAAH! WHAT?? WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?!
Tweek: The President! He tweeted about me! Why would he do that?! Did you see that?!
Craig: Yes, I did see that, so I went and got you something to make things better.
Tweek: Wwwhat?
Anchor 3: The President of the United States just tweeted again, this time saying "I hope ALL children of America will stand with Tweek in saying 'GO AHEAD AND BOMB US, KIM JONG DONG, WE FUCKING DARE YOU!'"
Lola: Talk to all the grownups you know about staying off their mobile devices when they get behind the wheel.
Richard: Hey Tweek.
Richard: How's it going with the fidget spinner?
Tweek: What is that??
Richard: I'm not sure.
Tweek: D'aahaahaah!
Tweek: Oh my God! Oh my God! Why is this happening to me?! They have to know that this isn't my fault!
Anchor 4: In response to the North Korean test, the President of the United States has just tweeted this statement: "You really think Tweek is scared? Tweek will single handedly go to North Korea and fuck ALL you slanty-eyed bitches doggy style."
Tweek: Whaaat?! Why would he say that?!
Anchor 4: The President also tweeted, "...if you even think Tweek is worried about a bunch of dipshit, poor-ass, third world rice pickers...think again!"
Tweek: Oh my God! What is he doing?!
Tweek: Why won't he just stop? Why?!
Tweek: Why does he keep making it worse?!
Driver 1: Aww, Jeez, looks like North Korea launched another missile.
Wife: Oh, really? Like another test? Where are you looking?
Driver 1: I'm on Drudge. You see what the President tweeted about it?
Wife: No, what'd he say?
Driver 1: President tweeted, "North Korea is the butt hole of Asia and-"
Stan: What the hell is going on?
Cartman: You didn't hear the announcement? They just cancelled Columbus Day! We have to come to school on Monday!
Kyle: They what??
Cartman: Some asshole went and convinced the school board that Columbus Day is racist and should be eliminated!
Stan: Dude, what asshole would take away a holiday?
Stan: Hey dude.
Kyle: Dude! Did you know it's your dad did who's getting the school to cancel Columbus Day?
Stan: Yeah. Dude, I don't know what's going on. He's really serious about this.
Kyle: Well, you've gotta do something. If you get him to back down, maybe the school will reconsider.
Stan: I can't get him to back down.
Kyle: Stan, I have to deal with my mom doing shit like this all the time, but she's never tried to take away a holiday. I'm your best friend, but I can't have your back when the guys find out about this.
Randy: Okay, Stan, you got your phone? I need to call everyone on this list. They all live in the same city.
Stan: Dad, listen: you need to ease off a little here.
Stan: Dad, come on. We all get your point, but don't you think you're overdoing it?
Randy: Good evening.
Field Reporter: Mr. Marsh, you took a dump on a beloved statue that's been an icon here in the city for years. What was your reasoning?
Field Reporter: So you're doing this because of indigenous peoples and their feelings.
Randy: I don't care if people get indigenous, I'll crap all over their statues! I'm the one who's indigenous that this landmark even exists!
Field Reporter: Aah, aaah, bah, back to you, Tom.
Butters: It ain't right. They make you work like a dog and then they just tear away your one day off in October like you're a piece of trash!
Cartman: Boo! Boo! Nobody likes you, Stan!
Stan: Look, I tried talking to him, alright? He's just really against all the things Columbus did.
Jimmy: Does anyone know what Columbus actually did?
Cartman: Yeah. In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus got us a day off skewl. That's what matters.
Kyle: No! No, wait guys. Maybe that's it. When I'm dealing with my mom, sometimes it works to be on her side for a minute. Maybe we should find out all the things people find offensive about Columbus and-
Cartman: And totally act like we care. I like it, Kyle.
Kyle: I'll just look up Columbus, offensive, inflammatory-
Butters: I love that movie.
Cartman: Yeah, this is a lot like that. What'd you find, Kyle?
Kyle: Nnnothing.
Butters: Dang it! There's nothing?
Stan: Hey Dad?
Randy: Not now, Stan. I'm working on a proposal to change British Columbia to just British.
Randy: Where did you get that?
Stan: If you hate Columbus so much, why did you dress like him?
Randy: Look, that was a long time ago, okay? It's just a dumb Halloween costume.
Randy: Look, I was younger! We were all... younger. It was another time. You have to understand, it was 2013. Everyone was stoked on Columbus back then.
Stan: Yeah, but Dad, you seem to be really stoked on Columbus.
Randy: If you guys found those pictures online, it's only a matter of time before everyone else does. People won't care about what I do now. They'll just see me as a thoughtless, indigenous son of a bitch.
Sharon: Randy, do you mind cleaning out the garage like I asked?
Female Jogger: I'm 13% victim.
Painter: I'm 21% victim.
Announcer: Order now and find out if your friends should be more sympathetic towards you. DNAandMe. Are you in?
Randy: Hell fucking yes I'm in.
Randy: All right, everybody. Hey, thanks for comin'. If uh-I can have your attention, please? I think we're ready to get started.
Randy: Yeah, I know, but I just, I was really excited, wanted everyone to witness my test.
Randy: Okay, great. I'm very interested to see [begins speaking more slowly] what those results have to say.
Masked voice: Listen to me carefully. The man who convinced you to cancel Columbus Day is a fraud.
Mr. Galtman: Who is this?
Masked voice: You will go online and search Instagram for images of Randy Marsh.
Mr. Galtman: I most certainly will not!
Kyle: What's he saying?
Mr. Galtman: Now you listen here, Mr. Man! The Galtmans don't believe in social media or the Internet! It's all fake news!
Mrs. Galtman: Fake news.
Randy: Shelly! We've got an emergency! We're getting rid of all the Columbus stuff in this house! Any Columbus costumes? Columbus pictures? They all gotta go!
Shelly: I don't give a shit about Columbus.
Randy: Sharon! Peter Galtman called! He sounds suspicious! We've gotta get rid of all our Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups! Where are they?!
Sharon: YOUR Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups are in that cupboard.
Randy: Shot, shot glasses, coffee cups, towels, plates. What about the Columbus figurine salt and pepper shakers?
Sharon: I don't know where YOU put them, Randy.
Sharon: YOU were stoked on Columbus, Randy. Not me.
Sharon: I actually was a little upset that you dressed up as Columbus for our wedding, but I decided-
Bill: I've never felt so alive until now.
Mr. Galtman: I spoke with Mr. Marsh and he denied any wrongdoing.
Stan: I don't think you're being intimidating enough.
Cartman: Yeah, get meaner, Kenny.
Kenny: Meaner like now, dude?
Stan: I don't know, like, like uh, maybe say-
Cartman: Just talk about cutting off his dick or something.
Kyle: No dude, that's too far.
Cartman: Okay, okay, just say we're gonna cut off part of his dick.
Stan: Just give me the phone! Hello!
Mr. Galtman: What?
Randy: Sharon, have you seen my Columbus staff and orb?
Randy: Sharon, Galtman called again. Somebody's out there trying to get me in trouble!
Sharon: Randy, why don't you just admit to people that maybe you were somewhat overly excited about Columbus in the past?
Bill: I wrote you a song to express my feelings for you.
Randy: Will you get out of here?!
Randy: Okay, okay
Bill: Randy, I cannot quit you.
Cartman: Guys, what are you going?
Butters: It's over, Eric. We have to come to school on Monday. Just face it.
Cartman: I'm not facing anything. We still have time. There has to be a way-
Kyle: Dude, there's nothing we can do, all right?
Cartman: Oh okay. I see. Is that what Columbus did? Just give up? On his dream? No! Columbus believed that kids should have a day off skewl! And even when his own country wouldn't support his cause, Columbus said "Fine! I'll go find a new land, where kids can have that day off!"
Jimmy: Eric, just l-let it go.
Sharon: What??
Randy: The people from the DNA test called. They're on their way over. You wanna come down?
Sharon: I'm doing something.
Randy: Oh Goddammit, what the hell do you want?
Bill: But Randy, what about the-
Bill: Yes. Yes, I understand.
DNA Test Administrator: Well, Mr. Marsh, we came because there was an irregularity with your test.
Randy: Well what? You found something there you didn't expect to find? What is it?
DNA Test Administrator: Well it's just a little too odd. We need to do the test again.
Randy: Do it again? That's not fair.
DNA Test Administrator: Mr. Marsh, please. If we could have one more sample. We want to be absolutely sure of what we found.
Mr. Galtman: This is a violation of my rights.
Stan: Just shut up, and watch what someone posted on their Instagram!
Mr. Galtman: I most certainly will not! If you want me to look at the Internet, I will die first. It's fake news!
Mr. Galtman: Oh, VHS is fine.
Mr. Galtman: Hmmm...
DNA Test Administrator: Oh, Mr. Marsh.
DNA Test Administrator: Good. Wha-what are you up to?
Randy: Chillin', chillin'.
DNA Test Administrator: Well, uhhh, we did get your DNA results back this morning. Would you like to go over them?
Randy: Oh, you did? Oh, great. Sure, why not? Uh, I'm here. Huh let's uh, let's do that.
DNA Test Administrator: Nno, we didn't find any trace of any Native American DNA in your test.
DNA Test Administrator: And, you might be interested to know that you're actually 2.8% Neanderthal, which is fairly high.
Randy: Neander-thal? What the hell is that about?
DNA Test Administrator: Well, the Neanderthals were actually a species that was wiped out by Homo sapiens.
Randy: Wiped out? All of my people?
DNA Test Administrator: Yes, but you see, because of some cross-breeding, some people like you still possess Neanderthal DNA. Isn't that interesting?
Mr. Galtman: Well well, Mr. Marsh. I'd like to have a word, please.
Mr. Galtman: What'd I do?
Bill: I brought my parents over so you could meet them.
Randy: Waww God!
Bill: Don't worry. My parents are very okay and cool with us.
Stan: Who the hell is that?
Randy: Yeah, sure! Everyone gang up on the Neanderthal! Isn't it funny!
Bill: Randy, you must face who you are. Stop pretending, Randy. For once, just allow yourself to feel.
Dave: Do you even know what indigenous means, you freakin' idiot?!
Randy: That's the spirit, Dave. Come on, everybody, let's just all be totally indigenous. Come on!
Kurt: Who the hell let this guy talk to the school council?
Randy: Good one Kurt. Your wife's a whore. Come on, everyone! Indigenous People's Day! Let's go for it!
Man 1: What on Earth was that?
Stan: We definitely don't have anyone with superhuman speed in our franchise.
Token: Fastpass, what makes you feel... qualified to be part of our cinematic universe?
Jimmy: Well, besides being super f-f-fa-fast, I also have a good attitude, and flexibility with my schedule on weekends.
Cartman: Fastpass, welcome to Coon and Friends. You are about to make a shitload of money.
Cartman: Alright, superheros, it's time to lay out our plan of action. As you can see, I have divided the franchise plan into three phases. Phase 1 begins with The Coon Netflix series and goes through the Coon and Friends United movie, where we introduce Toolshed and The Human Kite. In Phase 2 we do Coon vs. Fastpass followed by an origin movie about Mosquito.
Clyde: Bzzz oh boy, I get my own origin movie, bzzz?
Cartman: That's right. It's in Phase 2 that we introduce Tupperware, our black superhero, like an ace in the hole.
Stan: Whoawhoa wait, how come we gotta start off with a Netflix series? Can't we just go right into movies?
Stan: What is it?
Cartman: Onscreen!
Craig: You guys, we have a big problem.
Cartman: What is it, Super Craig?
Craig: Somebody's messing with our Facebook page. They're spreading all these lies, saying we like, burn the American flag and pee in each other's mouths.
Stan: Spreading lies how?
Cartman: Who would deliberately use Facebook in such a horribly reckless way?
Cartman: Butters?!
Butters: Oh, hey fellas.
Cartman: Butters, are you using Facebook to fuck with our superhero franchise?
Stan: Butters? Butters!
Stan: Dude, listen. We don't have time for this. Right now, Netflix is buying any show that people pitch them. We have a real shot at starting our franchise, and you are a part of that franchise plan, okay? We have movies planned for the bad guy.
Butters: You mean like Suicide Squad?
Stan: Yes!
Kyle: Dude, what a dick!
Cartman: If we don't find a way to stop him, we're never gonna make any money, you guys.
Ryan: Thanks for coming, everyone. I know you are all concerned as Sarah and I are about what's happening to our children.
Thomas: I just... can't believe that children in our town are dressing up in hero costumes and peeing in each other's mouths.
Randy: And who are these kids? Does anyone know? They're wearing capes and forcing objects into their own rectal cavities? Why?
Stephen: You know what I think the problem is? Facebook.
Randy: Facebook? How so?
Stephen: Well, look, we all know there's a lot of mixing of truth and fiction that's been on Facebook lately, and children lack the cognitive ability to determine what's true and what isn't on Facebook. That's why we now have young kids dressing up in costumes, eating poop, and having sex with antelopes in our town.
Thomas: Maybe we need to get our kids off of Facebook.
Randy: That'll never happen. You know what I say we do? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg to come and talk to us all about our concerns in this community.
Linda: Do you really think he'd come?
Mr. Mackey: For those of you who don't know uh, could you tell us who you are?
Mark: I am the founder and chairman of Facebook. But I also have a shtoile that is completely unblockable.
Mr. Mackey: Okay, we'll let him speak and then we'll uh open the floor to some questions if there's time, thank you.
Man 2: Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook has become a tool for some to disrupt our country and our community.
Mark: You say these things like they are my fault, and yet they are not.
Man 2: Well, you did create a platform with a monetary incentive for people to spread misinformation?
Cartman: Wilson Aubrey?
Wilson: Yeah.
Cartman: It's us, your heroes, Coon and Friends. We're uhm, just wondering why you stopped following us on Instagram?
Wilson: Because you victimize innocent people and poop in little girls' mouths.
Cartman: That's not true, Wilson. We're Coon and Friends, not Harvey Weinstein.
Wilson: Facebook says it's true.
Cartman: But it's NOT true.
Wilson: But Facebook says it's true.
Cartman: God dammit! Let's just face it! We're never gonna have a superhero franchise!
Kyle: It's so unfair.
Jimmy: Come on, fellas. Wu-we can't let Butters win.
Cartman: Forget it, Fastpass. The world hates us now.
Stan: Yeah, nobody believes in us.
Cartman: Fastpass is right. We let all this distract us from what's important. We just need to get the Netflix series and let our superhero franchise speak for itself!
Kyle: Coon, everybody hates us.
Heidi: I just- I thought we were meeting at the park. You didn't text or anything.
Cartman: Because we are Coon and Friends, and as long as we have each other, we can do anything!
Richard: I swear, that was the worst public speaker I've ever seen. What was Mark Zuckerberg's point?
Mrs. Tweak: I don't even understand what that was about.
Richard: Guess nobody realized that Mark Zuckerberg was such a penis.
Richard: What the hell?
Mrs. Tweak: It's Mark Zuckerberg.
Mark: I was invited here by people.
Richard: We invited you to come speak to our community about our problems!
Richard: Hey! Get out of our fridge!
Mark: Ha ha ha, this puny refrigerator could not block me. What makes you think you can?
Mark: Ha ha ha ha, you are no match for my shtoile.
Mark: So, where are we headed? Perhaps we should get some food.
Stephen: What, eh. Excuse me, this is our car?!
Mark: You call this a car? It wasn't even remotely able to block me. What is this car's shtoile?
Stephen: Get, get out of here, ya penis.
Mark: Ha ha ha ha. You say I am a penis and yet I am not a penis.
Operator 1: Netflix, you're greenlit. Who am I speaking with?
Operator 1: Okay, great. Would you like a pilot or just go straight to an order of six episodes?
Cartman: We'd like to go right into six episodes with a pickup option at the end of three.
Operator 1: Got it. Can you start shooting next month?
Operator 2: Got a show about transsexual dragons here.
Cartman: Yes. We are ready to start right now. We are very, very excited.
Operator 1: Okay, sounds great, we'll send you the contracts. Oh, and uh, what's the show about?
Cartman: It's a stand-alone series about a superhero called the Coon before he joins Coon and Friends.
Operator 1: Coon and Friends? You mean, the kids I just read about in the news who stabbed Jessica Alba?
Cartman: Look, you didn't, you didn't read that on the news you read that on Facebook!
Stan: Aw man, here we go.
Operator 1: Yeah, ah, dangit, we've never done this before, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on your show.
Cartman: Listen to me! There are falsehoods about us on Facebook that are NOT TRUE!
Operator 1: Well then, you should have those things taken down. It can't be that hard.
Cartman: It's a lot harder than you think!
Elderly Man: What the? Who are you?
Elderly Woman: I believe that's Mark Zuckerberg.
Elderly Man: Hey that's my soup!
Elderly Man: I don't have a shtoile.
Ryan: Hey! Get out of my bed!
Mark: I was invited here. I am only making use of a bed for sleeping, yehhhs?
Ryan: We just wanted you to come share your insights on Facebook!
Cartman: Butters!
Chaos #35: Oh no!
Butters: Calm down, everyone. Stick to your work. I will deal with these trespassers.
Kyle: We're here to put an end to you, Chaos!
Cartman: Yeah! I don't have buttsex with antelopes and Token doesn't poop in girls' mouths!
Butters: It's the 21st century, gentlemen! There's nothing illegal about what I'm doing.
Jimmy: Yeah? Nothing illegal about us kicking your ah...ass either.
Jimmy: Who the ss-Sam Hell is th-that?
Clyde: I think that's Mark Zuckerberg.
Mark: You want to get to Butters, riiight? You're gonna have to get through me, huuuh?!
Stan: Dude, this kid is deliberately lying about us on your platform for no other reason than to cause harm! Why are you protecting him?!
Mark: Simple. He paid me $17.23.
Butters: It's the Facebook Safeguard program. Just $17 monthly gets you personal protection from Mark Zuckerberg.
Mark: Come on! What's your shtoile?
Stephen: You have to do something! This guy's goin' around acting like everyone's stuff is his!
Thomas: I'm sick of getting out of the shower to find Mark Zuckerberg sitting on my toilet!
Sgt. Yates: Huh? What's that?
Randy: We invited Mark Zuckerberg to town.
Sgt. Yates: Uh huh, that's what I thought. You all brought Mark Zuckerberg into your lives and now you want the police to shoot him.
Stephen: Please, you don't understand! He-h he's such a penis!
Thomas: Yeah, and I'm pretty sure his voice is dubbed and he does all his own sound effects.
Sgt. Yates: Well that doesn't mean he's done anything illegal. Now, the police will help deal with Mark Zuckerberg, but we aren't going to shoot him.
The crowd: Awwwwww!
Sgt. Yates: I'm sorry, that's just the way it is. You all should've thought harder about this before letting him into your lives.
Cartman: When we all became superheroes, we took an oath. that no matter what it took, we would all make shitloads of money. But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg, right now, we are a superhero group that can't even get a show on Netflix.
Kenny: Zuckerberg is the key. He's the only person who can shut down Facebook.
Kyle: How are we gonna get him to do that?
Cartman: We're gonna beat him at his own game.
Barkley: We got the west entrance to town secure. How are you guys doing out east?
Barkley: Okay, Mr. Zuckerberg, that's gonna have to be it. Can't let you into town.
Mark: So, you think you can block me.
Barkley: Look, people don't want you here, okay? This is a quiet little town and-
Mark: Ha ha ha! You cannot block me!
Barkley: He walked though.
Jimmy: What's the matter? Too f-fast for ya?
Thomas: Hey look! The freaky costume kids are getting Zuckerberg! Get him, kids!
Randy: Poop in his mouth!
Mark: Ha ha ha, you tried to match my shtoile and failed!
Jimmy: Wha- Why, Mark Zuckerberg??
Cartman: And my friend Kyle, guilty of nothing but standing up for the rights of Jews!
Mark: What what what what are you talking about?
Mark: But, but hold on, that, that's not true.
Workers: Huh? Hey. What? Huh?
Butters: What's goin' on? Hey everyone, keep working!
Worker 1: We can't.
Worker 2: Something's wrong with Facebook.
Adam: It's gone. Like, somebody shut it down.
Butters: Curse you, Coon and Friends! This isn't over!
Stephen: Butters! You're the one who started all this?!
Butters: Uh oh.
Stephen: You think you're just so smart, don't you?! Make me look like a fool, will you?! We'll just see about this!
Butters: Wah. No sir, I, ah. No sir, I just ah.
Stephen: Not so funny now, is it?! Go on! Tell Mr. Putin what you told me!
Butters: Well I was just, uh, well, I just said how I just used Facebook like Russia did. And I really didn't break any rules.
Kenny: How come I have to have the video game? I want a movie too!
Craig: Yeah, but he's saying he doesn't ever get his own movie.
Jimmy: Do I get my own movie?
Cartman: Not everyone gets their own movie!
Tweek: This franchise plan sucks!
Clyde: Oh Jesus, here we go again.
Stan: No, Wonder Tweek is right. It was better when we started the movies off with the Tupperware prequel.
Kyle: Dude you can't do a prequel first.
Stan: Why not?
Kyle: 'Cause then it's not a prequel, it's just... first. And besides, Tupperware isn't our strongest character.
Token: Fuck you, it's better than the Human Kite!
Kenny: He just likes this plan because he gets two movies in Phase 1.
Cartman: Guys! We have to just go with this plan! We don't even have one movie yet!
Stan: You go with the plan! Maybe we'll just... go and do our own franchise!
Kenny: Yeah!
Tweek: Yeah!
Cartman: Oh! You want civil war! Is that what you want?!
Cartman: Oh fu- oh fuck you! Get out of my house!
Craig: I thought Civil War wasn't supposed to happen until Phase 3.
Marcus' Mom: What's wrong with him?
Marcus' Dad: Can't you tell? He's high on painkillers!
Marcus' Dad: All right, kids, uh, why don't we head back to the party and cut the cake?
Officer Stevens: Another drug overdose?
Officer Stevens: Prescription drugs, but with no prescription.
Johnson: You guys know where all these illegal meds are coming from?
Officer Stevens: Most likely from the prisons. Whenever there's a drug epidemic you can usually trace it back to people who've been... thrown away by society and forgotten about.
Stan: Yeah, I'm here to visit my grandpa?
Stan: It's just some Hummels.
Stan: Grandpa?
Stan: That's what the guy gave me.
Marvin: It's okay, Billy. I'm just gonna need you to deliver another one of Ms. McGullicutty's crochet pillows.
Stan: Aw, come on, Grandpa. Isn't it enough I come to visit?
Marvin: You don't understand how it works in here. Ms. McGullicutty is top bitch. You do what she says, or you pay the price.
Kyle: Dude, Stan. Come on, dude, we're gonna go set off fireworks at Kenny's house.
Stan: I will. I just gotta do this for my grandpa first.
Cartman: Again? Dude, how many crappy crochet pillows do you have to give out for him?
Stan: I don't know. It's what he wants. I feel bad for him, all right? I think he's miserable.
Cartman: He's old. He's supposed to be miserable.
Swiper: Are you Stan Marsh? It's me, Swiper.
Stan: Cool. Do you have the Hummel?
Kyle: Dude, that's really weird.
Stan: Old people love Hummels, dude.
Cartman: Dude, what the fuck, Stan?!
Stan: I don't know, all right?!
Kyle: You didn't know you were slinging drugs for your grandpa?
Stan: It didn't occur to me as a possibility.
Cartman: Dude, did you hear everyone in school?! They're coming after you! You killed Swiper the Fox, and we were standing there with you! You gotta tell people we had no idea what was going on!
Stan: I had no idea what was going on!
Cartman: Our only way out is to go to the police right now and turn Stan's grandpa in!
Stan: No, we don't have to do that! Let me talk to him. I can put a stop to this.
Stan: There were drugs in the crochet pillow, weren't there?! Do you know people are dying?!
Marvin: Oh, Ms. McGullicutty. How are you feeling today?
Stan: Oh, uh, ma'am? My grandpa actually really needs those drugs. He's in a lot of pain.
Marvin: That's my grandson, uh he he's worthless.
Stan: What, what is she talking about? What's the quiet room?
Marvin: I told you, she has all the pull in here. You go against what she says, you end up in solitaire.
Mr. Standish: No! No, please, uh I didn't do anything!
Tony: It's all right, Mr. Standish, you just need a little quiet time.
Marcus: I understand that today they are performing Chuck E. Cheese's autopsy?
Receptionist: Oh, the kids' party performer. Yeah.
Marcus: As a concerned member of the public, I wish to be present.
Receptionist: Uh, sorry, children aren't really allowed in autopsies.
Marcus: Then I shall wait here to learn the coroner's findings.
Coroner: Have these put in the garbage.
Marcus: What did you find, coroner?
Coroner: Who is this?
Marcus: There is an epidemic in our community, sir. Some of us actually care to confront the problem! Now, dammit, what did you find?
Coroner: Nothing out of the ordinary. The subject died of a simple overdose. We found nothing else except for two Hummmels in the subject's rectal cavity.
Marcus: Hummels? In his rectal cavity, you say? And you do not find this out of the ordinary?
Coroner: Not at all. We found Hummels in nearly all the birthday entertainers' anal cavities. It's very common in our overdose victims.
Marcus: Mmmm, a bit too common, don't you think?
Stan: Guys, why does Grandpa have to be in a nursing home? Can't he live with us again?
Randy: Stan, Grandpas has a lot of needs that we can't provide him here. He needs professional supervision.
Stan: Is that really it? Because I, I just feel like we kind of threw Grandpa away and forgot about him.
Randy: Oh really? Do you have any idea how much money we pay to have Grandpa in that place? Your grandpa is stylin'! Can you imagine being able to just sit around all day and not have to do anything but eat and watch TV?
Stan: Yeah. I'd probably go crazy and wanna kill myself.
Randy: Jesus, Stan! It's not like he's in jail!
Stan: Yeah, it's kind of like jail. You should go visit him.
Randy: I can't! I'm too busy busting my ass to pay the bills for that place, and to pay for your guitar lessons!
Stan: I don't have guitar lessons.
Randy: I don't want to go there. It's depressing. Aw you tricked me.
Kyle: Well, you need to get Hummels without making Butters a drug dealer!
Butters: Drug dealer??
Stan: All right, all right! I think I know another way.
Delivery Man: Hey, we have this week's delivery of medications.
Stan: Ah!
Marcus: Hello, Mr. Marsh.
Stan: Uh hey, hey Marcus.
Marcus: I understand you've become quite the Hummel collector lately. What's the... fascination with Hummels?
Stan: Nothing. I-look, I, I just really like Hummels, okay? I'm just, I'm really into Hummels.
Marcus: Ah! I see. So then you should be able to tell me what this Hummel is called!
Stan: That, that's uh...
Marcus: Come on! If you're a Hummel expert, then you should know its name!
Stan: That, it's, it's "Whistling In The Rain."
Marcus: Wrong! It's called "Stormy Weather!" Do you know where it was found?
Stan: No.
Marcus: It was found deep in the anus of one Chuck E. Cheese, the renowned entertainer beloved by millions! If you know something about the epidemic that is killing artists, you'd better cough it up!
Stan: Marcus, trust me. You don't wanna get involved.
Marcus: I became involved when Chuck E. Cheese collapsed like a rag doll before my very eyes! If you had any involvement, I will bring you down!
Randy: Well, it's really great seeing you, Dad. Guess we oughtta hit the road soon.
Marvin: You finally come to visit and leave after 10 minutes?
Randy: Aw Jesus, now we know where Stan gets his guilt trips from!
Cartman: Ohooo, you're dead Butters.
Butters: Haw Jeez.
Cartman: If it has to do with your heroin operation, count us out.
Stan: I just talked to my grandpa. There's more at work here than just old people pushing pills.
Kyle: Stan, we told you we don't wanna be involved.
Stan: But I know what to do! Whoever has the best Hummels controls the nursing home. We've gotta steal this lady's Hummel collection and give it to my grandpa!
Kyle: Dude, we're not getting involved!
Stan: Cartman, if you have an idea, please tell me. I need you.
Cartman: I know how to distract old people.
Kyle: Haww shit!
Marcus: Yes?
Ambulance lady: All right, let us through. Get away, kids.
Marcus: Peppa, now! Why Hummels?! You've got to squeal!
Marcus: It's okay, she's with Chuck E. Cheese now.
Vicky: Can I help you?
Cartman: Oh yes, hello. We are adorable children here to entertain old people.
Vicky: Didn't think we had anyone scheduled tonight. Are you with the Protestant youth group?
Cartman: Yes that's right, we are young prostitutes here to volunteer however we can.
Vicky: Fine. Round them up, we got another kids choir!
Toby: Come on, let's go. Children's choir in the commons.
Toby: Darlin' children are gonna sing for you! Move your asses!
Elderly Man 2: Aw, not again.
Elderly Man 3: You suck!
Cartman: Hey hey! We are adorable children trying to bring sunshine into your lives!
Marcus: Hello, Mr. Marsh!
Stan: Marcus.
Marcus: Oh, I bet you are! You, your grandpa, ALL the people here, are going to jail! I'm calling the police!
Stan: You can put an end to this place, but you won't be stopping the problem. These people are victims too, Marcus. Victims of a way bigger game being played by way bigger people!
Stan: I know. I know.
Butters: Hey, where are ya'll goin'?
Marvin: Billy. What are you doin' here?
Stan: Yeah, Grandpa. Now you can put a stop to all this, right?
Marvin: Yeah. I just might be able to.
Stan: What are you doing, Grandpa?
Marvin: I told you, Billy. These Hummels hold a special power with old people.
Cartman: ...That's pretty sweet.
Stan: Congratulations on becoming head bitch, Grandpa.
Marvin: Thank you, Billy. Now if we could only take down the real douchebags who profit from all this.
Stan: Ahhh, don't worry. I have a feeling that's about to happen.
Stuart: What time are the other guys gettin' there?
Roger: Everyone just said sundown, which should be soon.
Gerald: Lookin' good, Ryan.
Randy: Hey Sharon, did you see the box of Jack Daniels?
Sharon: Oh no, you're not doing this again.
Randy: What do you mean? Of course I am.
Sharon: Stan wanted us to take him to the pumpkin patch.
Randy: Sharon, you know the week leading up to Halloween is always my Witch Party Week with the guys.
Sharon: Yeah, and you guys get wasted.
Randy: We have some drinks. Come on, all the other guys' wives aren't being bitchy about it.
Gerald: Alright, Randy's got the JD!
Randy: Yep. Who's got the other stuff.
Cartman: Honey, the pumpkin patch opened like an hour ago and 'member how I was saying I want to get there early?
Heidi: [dressed in a black spider suit and orange skirt with bats on it] What do you think?
Cartman: Wha-what?
Heidi: Okay, spider or the bat?
Heidi: Really? 'Cause I think I like the bat.
Heidi: What, babe?
Heidi: 'Kay, all set.
Cartman: You don't need glitter lip gloss!
Cartman: No! No, we don't need to talk! Ah, I'm super happy!
Cartman: Cool, you got to pee again. Awesome.
Stephen: Almost thought you guys were gonna bail on us.
Gerald: Sup, Stephen, Chip.
Randy: Well, I got the Jack.
Randy: Oh yeah! Jack and Crack Witch Week! Let's do this!
Mr. Turner: Thanks for taking the kids out tonight, Ms. Cartman. Heidi's been looking forward to it.
Liane: Oh yes, my little Eric just loves the pumpkin patch. It's one of his favorite events of the year.
Cartman: Okay, come on, let's go.
Liane: All right, you kids all ready?
Nancy Turner: Ohoh, don't you look cute, Heidi.
Heidi: Hold on, Eric. I want a picture.
Cartman: No! Pumpkin patch is gonna, eh-
Heidi: Will you take a picture, dad?
Cartman: See, all the best pumpkins get taken and then eh-
Mr. Turner: Cheese.
Cartman: Okay, come on! Here we go, going out the door! Go, Mom!
Heidi: Bye Daddy! Love you!
Heidi: Oh crap. Hang on! I forgot my bracelet!
Liane: Eric, potty mouth.
Cartman: Arrrrrrrrgh!
The Men: Put a spell on our bosses. Put a spell on our wives. A hex on the Patriots. Let's fuck up their lives!
Randy: And screw the Raiders too!
Randy: No way. Check out Stephen, you guys.
Chip: I mean it! I got this spell book last month. Got it in Salem, Massachusetts. They say it's real.
Randy: Like real, how?
Chip: Like from the Devil himself. You guys wanna try it?
The Men: Yeah.
Scott: Oh boy! What a great time that was.
Cartman: Yeah, we are just getting here.
Ticket-taker: Okay uh, go on in, I suppose. Petting zoo's closed, and I think they stopped the churro machine.
Cartman: The petting zoo's cl- The petting zoo's closed?
Ticket-taker: Yeah. You can still maybe do the bouncy house.
Heidi: Come on, babe!
Chip: Arkna. Peduum. Uthnod boral.
Randy: Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa whoa.
Chip: Ach. Oh, it burns!
Chip: I'll kill you all! Kill you all!
Ticket-taker: Get out! Everyone out!
Cartman: What do you mean?! I just got here!
Heidi: Come on, Eric!
Randy: Oh. Hey, didn't see you there.
Sharon: Did you hear anything about what happened last night?
Randy: Uuuhhh, nnno, what happened?
Randy: Are you serious?!
Sharon: You heard nothing about this?! He flew away vowing we'd all be dead by Halloween!
Sharon: Randy, what did you guys do at that party?
Sharon: People were hurt!
Randy: Yeah, I agree! It's awful! We're not like Chip, okay?! He's a bad witch!
Kyle: Did any of you guys actually see the witch?
Jimmy: Yeah, it was terrifying. She had a broom and a cackle and everything.
Token: What are we gonna do, guys?
Kyle: They say she blew up the pumpkin patch. Did any of you guys see that?
Stan: No, I missed the whole thing. I always try to get to the pumpkin patch really early.
Stan: We've got to take matters into our own hands. None of us is safe.
Butters: Yeah, but what are we gonna do?
Kyle: No, we've got to just hope the police will handle it.
Butters: Yeah, we've got to save Halloween. Don't you think so, Eric?
Butters: We've got to do something to get rid of her!
Cartman: Yes. You're right, guys. It's my only way out.
Randy: All right, see you, Sharon. Have a good night.
Randy: What do you mean? It's Day 2 of Witch Week with the guys.
Randy: Why not?
Sharon: Randy, a real witch is flying around in the skies snatching children! I don't think this is the best time for you to be wearing a witch costume and partying!
Gerald: Hey Randy.
Randy: Sup guys?
Ryan: You know, just getting a bunch of shit for being witches.
Randy: I know, right? It's like, there's one awful witch who wants to kill everybody, so now they're coming after all of us. This is like a witch... thingy.
Stuart: It's like a witch pursuit thingy.
Randy: A witch uhhh-
Gerald: It's a witch chase and shoot 'em up.
Randy: Yeah, that's what it is!
Ryan: Hey, what the hell is this?
Stuart: Oh my God.
Randy: They can't do this! The whole town really is on a witch pursuit thing!
Kyle: Check this out, you guys. It says that to destroy a witch you need bent pits, nine in all, each bent into an L shape.
Cartman: Hey guys, I think I got it figured out.
Stan: You do?
Cartman: Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that's right. Stan and Kyle will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will-
Stan: Wait wait wait wait. What the fuck are you talking about?
Cartman: This is how we're going to get rid of Heidi.
Kyle: Nobody's talking about getting rid of Heidi!
Cartman: You guys said you would help me get rid of her!
Kyle: OF THE WITCH!
Cartman: Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell, you guys!
Kyle: Then break up with her! You clearly can't stand her! LET THE POOR GIRL GO!
Cartman: I've tried! It's impossible!
Kyle: Heidi is a nice girl! How could you be so awful to her?!
Richard: Oh wait, I'm supposed to be-
Gerald: Yes they are, boys! And next they'll be coming after you! 'Cause you're all little sons a witches!
Cartman: Hey, babe.
Heidi: Oh. Hey Eric.
Cartman: Listen uh, there's a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you and me should go. What do you say?
Heidi: A costume party? With everything that's going on?
Cartman: Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out.
Heidi: Well... I guess.
Cartman: Cool. I'll pick you up at 5.
Stephen: Randy, can I talk to you?
Randy: Sure, Stephen.
Stephen: I've been doing a lot of thinking, Randy. About the past. About what we've done. I think it's time we come clean and tell everyone about the crack. And the spells against our wives.
Stephen: I have to admit what I've done wrong, Randy! I feel like everything's crashing down and I want Linda to hear it from me first.
Randy: Okay, we smoked a little crack. We put harmless spells on our wives. We were just messing around, it was harmless fun.
Stephen: Was it? Or did we close our eyes to what Chip Duncan was becoming?
Randy: Stephen, you can't turn on your own kind. That's what these witch pursuit thingies do, okay? They make everyone go crazy.
Stephen: I'm sorry, Randy. I have to clear my conscience.
Heidi: Don't you think we should stay on the main roads, Eric? This seems like a bad place to be right now.
Heidi: Eric, come on, this is a bad idea. Let's turn around.
Cartman: Well, Heidi, if we'd been on time, we wouldn't need to take a short cut. But I wanted to give you your space to get ready.
Cartman: Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can't blame you for missing the pumpkin patch.
Stan: Dude, is your dad home?
Kyle: No, I, I don't know where he is.
Stan: We can't find our dads either.
Butters: Yeah, and it turns out our dads and the bad witch were all part of the same witch group.
Stan: We asked our moms, and they said this has been going on for years. We've got to find them before something stupider happens.
Kyle: How are we gonna do that?
Stan: There's another guy. Someone else who was in the witches' club that hasn't been around for a while.
Kyle: Who?
Butters: Oh, uh, eh hello Mr. President. How are you?
Butters: How uh, how is runnin' the country going?
Garrison: Oh, it's fine. You know, just makin' the country great again.
Butters: Did you get rid of all the immigrants like you said?
Garrison: I got rid of like, six of 'em so far. You know, it's a little harder than I thought.
Butters: Cool. Ah-and did you build that big wall you were gonna build?
Garrison: Don't be a dick, Butters. Are you just callin' to shit on my Halloween?
Butters: N-no, sir! I uh, well, the thing is, uh, didn't you used to do J and C Witch Week with our dads?
Garrison: Yeah, it was my favorite time of year. Now I just have to celebrate it alone.
Butters: Well, the thing is, Mr. President, one of the guys did a spell and took a bunch of children, and he's gonna eat 'em all.
Garrison: Lemme guess: Chip Duncan. Oh, that guy was always such a douche.
Butters: Mr. President, please, you've gotta help. Our dads can't do anything 'cause they're scared people are comin' after all wtiches.
Garrison: Comin' after all witches? Oh, Jeez...
Sgt. Yates: So you were there when the witch showed up and took your girlfriend.
Cartman: Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too late.
Sgt. Yates: What was your girlfriend wearing?
Cartman: She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from Germany.
Rick: And you didn't stop at all to think that what you were doing might attract a witch?
Cartman: Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?!
Rick: No, I'm just saying that if there's a big fat witch around, maybe you shouldn't walk around in the woods dressed as Hansel and Gretel.
Cartman: Ohhhhh!
Sgt. Yates: Whoa, whoa, not cool, Rick. Not cool.
Cartman: I will have your badge, sir!
Cop 1: Detective! Detective! Call just came in. The witch has been spotted at Ross Dress For Less.
Sgt. Yates: Everyone to Ross Dress For Less, now!
Stephen: Guys? I'm here. Guys? What's this all about?
Randy: Hello, Stephen.
Stephen: Oh, hey. What are we meeting here for?
Ryan: It's too late, Stephen. We called the police. We know you took those children.
Stephen: What? What uh, What are you doing?
Randy: We're putting a stop to you, Stephen, because that's what good witches do!
Sgt. Yates: It's over, Stotch. What have you done with the children?
Stephen: "What's up, bros?" Chip, do you see all the chaos you've caused?
Chip: Yeah, so? I'm a witch.
Randy: Ugh, you understand everyone associates us with you, right?
Chip: Of course they do. You're all witches too, dudes!
Steve: Not like you!
Stuart: What'd you do with the children?
Chip: I'm going to use their souls to increase my power!
Stan: Butters, come on! We've gotta go!
Butters: Okay! Where?
Stan: I guess our witches were gonna sacrifice your witch, but then the bad witch showed up and now the witch we called just arrived. There's witches everywhere!
Randy: Look, Chip, if we had known you were gonna hurt people, we would have never even hung out.
Chip: Oh, give me a break, Randy.
Randy: No, seriously.
Chip: Like if one of you guys had the power I have, you wouldn't use it.
Randy: No we wouldn't!
Chip: Oh, hey man!
Garrison: You're ruining the party for everyone, Chip! I'm here to take you out!
Sgt. Yates: Is that all of them?
Cop 2: There's one more little girl. Come on out, little girl.
Heidi: Okay. Just a second.
Cop 2: Com- come on, little girl. Everyone's waitin' on ya.
Heidi: Okay. Almost ready. Hang on.
Gerald: Well, we did it, guys.
Ryan: Everyone will be stoked on us now.
Randy: Hey! And there's still a few nights left of Jack and Crack Witch Week.
The Men: Party's back on! We did it, guys!
Heidi: All ready to trick or treat?
Heidi: Eric, this isn't working.
Cartman: Heid- Heidi, no, please! Heidi, Heidi, I would be nothing without you, okay? I'm sorry. Okay? Please!
Heidi: You called me a whore and pushed me in front of a car.
Cartman: Heidi, I was in a bad mood! I told you, that's what happens after I eat! My blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I cra-
Heidi: Eric, you just can't keep being mean to me and blaming it on your blood sugar.
Cartman: But ih, but it's true, Heidi! It's all my mom's fault. She feeds me all this crap, and my body doesn't know how to process it. Mom! Mom!
Liane: Yes, hon?
Cartman: You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you bitch?! Get outta here!
Heidi: Eric, if blood sugar is really the problem, then you need to change how you ear, right?
Cartman: Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean?
Heidi: Eric, every time I've talked to you about maybe being a vegan with me, you just tell me vegans are pussies. But then you try and blame food and your mom for being-
Cartman: It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more than ever. I wand to do this. Please!
Heidi: You really mean it?
Cartman: Yes, Heidi! That's how much I love you! I'm vegan from now on.
Heidi: All right, Eric. We'll see how this goes, okay? See you tomorrow.
Cartman: That dirty whore! Who does that bitch think she is?! Packing my lunch for me?! Fuck her, dude!
Jimmy: Pissed off at your girlfriend again, huh Eric?
Cartman: She's not a girlfriend! She's a controlling, manipulative whore!
Kyle: That's enough, Cartman! I am so sick of hearing you call Heidi horrible things!
Cartman: That's because you don't understand how much it sucks to be in a relationship!
Cartman: Oh hey babe, what's going on?
Heidi: What are you up to?
Kyle: I don't get it. I just really don't get it. How is she still supporting him?!
Stan: She loves him, I guess.
Kyle: But he clearly sucks! She has to know he sucks. What the hell is going on?!
Butters: Well, it's not our problem.
Kyle: It is our problem. This is affecting us! Our whole school. There's got to be a reason she sticks by him.
Heidi: Oh. Hey Kyle.
Kyle: Hey. Uh, listen, uh... I-I know you and Cartman have an anniversary coming up and, I was just wondering, you know, um. How do you think he's doing? Aaas a boyfriend.
Heidi: Well, whattaya mean?
Kyle: Well, you know, like, some of us are thinking that, uh, maybe he's not super-qualified to be with you?
Heidi: Oh, God, not you too.
Kyle: Just, like, what are the things about Cartman that you find remotely redeeming?
Heidi: Look, don't you think I get it enough from my girlfriends? "He sucks, Heidi. What's wrong with you? Why can't you admit he's a loser? How could anyone ever go with him?" I was just following my heart. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
Kyle: You don't have to get defensive. I just-
Kyle: Wooow.
Heidi: What?
Heidi: Yeah, the vegan meat that's made with all vegetables and plants.
Cartman: Well, I tried it and you were right. You can't even tell the difference between that and real meat.
Heidi: Really? That's great, babe.
Cartman: So now I've been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It's called Beyond KFC.
Heidi: Oh wow.
Cartman: It's all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try it.
Heidi: Yeah, it's really good.
Kyle: Guys, listen: I think I know why Heidi won't admit Cartman's a horrible boyfriend.
Stan: Dude, are you still on this?
Kyle: Yeah! It's important.
Butters: Maybe she's telling the truth, Kyle. Maybe Eric really does love and support her in ways that we don't see.
Stan: No.
Token: Heidi's getting fat?
Heidi: I, I know, but I just feel bloated. I think there might have been something bad in that Beyond Arby's.
Heidi: Can you come with?
Kyle: We have to help that girl. Can't you see what's happening?
Stan: Kyle, it's none of our business.
Kyle: You're wrong. In a way... I think we're all going out with Cartman right now.
Mitch McConnell: Mr. President, we have a problem. People are pretty upset.
Garrison: Hoh, don't tell me people are still made about that nigger thing.
Mike Pence: It's pronounced Niger, Mr. President. And it's a country in Africa.
Paul Ryan: Mr. President, you need to be a little more careful. There's an investigation. A worker with ties to Russia was found raped and executed.
Garrison: Raped and executed? Oh, you mean fucked to death? Oh yeah, that was me.
McConnell: Mr. President, people are starting to question your oath to the office.
Garrison: My oath to the office was that I would fuck everyone to death, remember?
Memberberries: Ooo, I 'member. Me too, I 'member. I 'member that.
McConnell: How are we supposed to put a positive spin on it?
Ryan: It's getting pretty hard to keep defending you. Maybe it's time we put our foot down.
Wendy: What do you want, Kyle?
Kyle: It's Heidi Turner. You guys shouldn't criticize her so much for going with Cartman.
Annie: Why not? Eric Cartman's a horrible person.
Kyle: I know! I, I know that, okay? Trust me, I hate Cartman as much as any of you, but just, give her some space, you know? You can't keep on saying "We told you so", because if you make her feel dumb, she just doubles down and tries to prove herself that it wasn't dumb.
Nichole: Why do you care? Do you like Heidi?
Kyle: No!
Molly: Oh my God, he so likes Heidi.
Lola: Obvi.
Kyle: No I don't! ... Do I?
Kyle: Yeah, no, we're not getting involved with that.
Butters: Oh, we're not?
Butters: Oh. Okay then.: Dialog
Kyle: Cartman, can we talk?
Kyle: I just, I hope that maybe you can realize what you have with Heidi and, and just try to be good to her, okay?
Cartman: I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It's his favorite.
Heidi: Oh, okay. Um, are we still on for lunch?
Cartman: You betcha, can't wait.
Reporter: Speaker Ryan, it's the anniversary of the President being elected. How do you think he's doing?
Ryan: Well whattaya mean? He's great. We're doing great. A lot of people judge him and just see the negative. People don't know how great the President can be behind closed doors. They don't get to see all his good qualities.
Reporter: Uh huh. And is that semen on your black eye?
Ryan: Oh. No, I-uh I tripped on a doorknob and uh that's just, that's doorknob cum.
Kyle: You doin' okay, Heidi?
Heidi: I keep thinking Eric's going to change.
Kyle: No, Heidi. Good people make bad decisions every day.
Cartman: Hei, Hei, Heidi broke up with me, Token.
Token: So?
Cartman: I have nothing now, Token. She was my whole world. Can, can I just stay here with you, please?
Token: What?! Why?! You still have a house!
Token: Get outta here!
Cartman: Heidi broke up with meeeeee.
Token: ...NO!!
Ryan: Okay, we're safe to talk.
Pence: It's not safe! Nowhere is safe, don't you understand?! We're all about to get killed!
Ryan: Sshh, keep your voices down! Look at this!
Pence: What are all these numbers?
Ryan: The latest approval ratings. I've been researching our own independent poll. The President is tanking. These numbers are so low that we just might have an out. Well, don't you guys see what this means?
McConnell: I don't know anything, I'm just a turtle.
Ryan: It means that the swing voters are turning against him. It's those people that matter. Those are the ones who can finally turn this thing around!
Pence: No, nothing, Mr. President.
Ryan: Nothing!
McConnell: No, nope!
Garrison: Just having' a little chat or somethin'?
Cartman: So... You guys about done with the soup?
Linda: Don't you like it, Eric?
Cartman: Well yeah, no, it's great. It's just- well, what time do you guys usually go out and disrespect the flag and stuff?
Steve: What?
Cartman: Oh no... Don't tell me you guys already disrespected the flag and flipped over cars today. Did I miss it?
Steve: What the hell are you talking about?!
Token: I told you not to let him in.
Cartman: Please, I don't know what to do with all this anger and hurt!
Linda: I'm sorry your girlfriend broke up with you, Eric, but... maybe you'll get back together.
Cartman: No, no, we've broken up before, but this time it's different. I can tell. Something's changed with her. Heidi won't even answer my phone calls.
Steve: Heidi? Turner? The Turners' daughter?
Cartman: Yeah...
Steve: I thought she was with that Kyle Broflovski kid.
Steve: I saw them at the park today holding hands.
Steve: Yeah, Kyle.
Cartman: Did it bother you that I was happy?! Is that why you took her from me, Kyle?!
Kyle: Cartman, you weren't happy.
Cartman: Shut up, Kyle!
Kyle: All you did was bitch about her all the time.
Cartman: You're not gonna talk your way out of this one! This is the end, Kyle! It's you and me!
Kyle: Come on, Cartman. I-
Kyle: Stop it!
Cartman: All you've ever done is work to ruin my life! Well now I'm finally gonna fight back!
Butters: Fuck him up, Eric!
Kyle: I'm sorry, Cartman. You just have to accept that Heidi's moved on.
Molly: Guys, I just wanna say, here's to Heidi. Welcome back to the land of the living.
The other girls: Yay Heidi!
Red: No worries. We're just glad you finally came to your senses.
Red: Uhh, yeah, like what? Racism?
Bebe: Or the sociopath part?
Courtney: Yeah. I mean, no offense, Heidi, but what the fuck were you thinking?
Lola: Guys, she admitted she made a mistake.
Bebe: Don't worry, Heidi. We're not gonna keep telling you we told you so.
Bebe: The only thing I wanna know is... how did you bring yourself to actually KISS him?
The girls: Eewwww!
Red: Can you imagine? Eric Cartman's breath on your mouth?
Heidi: Hi Eric.
Cartman: What are you doing here?
Heidi: I don't know. I think I- I just wanna make sure... you're doing okay. I want you to know I'll always care about you.
Cartman: No... You need to know something, Heidi. None of this is your fault.
Heidi: But I'm the one who-
Cartman: No. Heidi, none of this is your fault. There's stuff I never told you. It's time... It's time I did.
Heidi: Hey.
Kyle: Hey! You all set to go?
Kyle: Okay, sure.
Heidi: Kyle, I've been under a lot of stress lately, and it was all making me really confused.
Kyle: Yeah, that's understandable.
Kyle: What do you mean?
Heidi: I've come to realize that it's not my fault. It's your fault, Kyle. You made all this happen. Made me question who I was.
Kyle: But Heidi, I thought-
McConnell: Cha cha cha.
McConnell: Cha cha cha.
Nathan: For our science fait project, we will be showing the destructive force of nature by simulating a volcano!
The kids: Ooooooh.
Nathan: With vinegar and baking soda, we will make this paper-mch volcano EXPLODE.
The kids: Aaaaaaa.
Nathan: With the power and fury of Mount Kilauea. Our science fair project is sure to be... a blast. Get it? A. Blast.
Nathan: We've done it, Mimsy. We're gonna win the science fair for sure. And then, every chick in this school is gonna wanna have sex with us.
Mimsy: Uh, gee boss, I don't know about sex with no chicken.
Wendy: Is it just me, or are things around here getting worse and worse?
Millie: It's definitely not just you. I think everyone's in shock that Heidi went back to Cartman.
Theresa: What keeps driving her back to him? It's so weird.
Isla: She's so... mean and angry these days.
Wendy: People change. They say you become more and more like the person you're with and, I guess it's true with Heidi.
Isla: Hey, Heidi.
Heidi: What are you guys talkin' about?
Nichole: Nothing.
Wendy: Heidi, are you okay? It's just... you look...
Heidi: I look what?
Wendy: Ngh, you know, y-you just look-
Heidi: What? I look fat? Is that what you wanna say, Wendy? Fuck you, bitch!
Theresa: She's just concerned, Heidi.
Nathan: Well hello, gentlemen.
Jimmy: Oh hey fellas, we're doing great.
Timmy: Timmih!
Nathan: Thought we'd stop by to see how your- science fair project is going.
Mimsy: Dah I thought we was comin' to rub their faces in how good our science fair project was, boss.
Jimmy: Oh, would you like to see them?
Timmy: Timmah.
Jimmy: Where all good scientists learn from. Octonauts.
Timmy: Octonauts!
Jimmy: Some scientists believe the study of water bears is key to human survival.
Mimsy: Aw jeez, that sounds a lot better than a lava volcano, huh boss?
Nathan: Well, not really, because the science fair is supposed to be an experiment. I fail to see what the experiment is here.
Mackey: Come in.
Mackey: Oh yes, Heidi, uh, we just wanted to see if you have transportation to the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend, or if you wanted us to set somethin' up for you.
Heidi: What?
Mackey: ...Uh, Saturday is the science fair, and, you're the judge for the competition?
Heidi: Judge a special needs science fair? Ahem, no thanks.
Mackey: Well, Heidi, is there a problem with you bein' the judge this weekend?
Heidi: Uhh, yeah? It's Saturday, and I don't wanna be at skewl?
Mackey: But you're always the judge of the Special Ed Science Fair because you're our best science student.
Heidi: So now I'm gonna be punished by being force to judge a bunch of handicapped kids?!
Mackey: But... Okay, you see, the problem is that you volunteered last month, Heidi. You said you wanted to do it, m'kay?
Mackey: Look, the kids have worked really hard and have done some amazing projects.
Heidi: You're gonna force me to come to skewl on a Saturday?!
Mackey: Heidi, eh... is everything all right?
Heidi: Oh what? Are you gonna call me fat now too?! It just so happens I'm a vegan, which means it'd difficult for me to get enough protein, so my body doesn't burn fat, it burns muscle, which makes it look like I'm fat, but I'm actually WAY healthier than any of YOU!!
Mackey: Heidi, you're judging the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend.
Heidi: Oh, Goddammit!
Mimsy: Gee, we could get in a lot of trouble. Ya, you sure we should mess with Jimmy and Timmy's science fair project?
Nathan: Mimsy, do you know what Jimmy is? He's a cock blocker.
Mimsy: Eh what's a cock blocker?
Nathan: Every time I come up with a way to score with the ladies, there's Jimmy tryin' to one-up me. This science fair is supposed to finally make us successful enough to get chicks.
Mimsy: D'aw, gee, I don't know if we should use our position of power to exploit women.
Heidi: This is bullcrap! How can they force me to be the science fair judge?! Now I know how it feels to be a slave!
Wendy: It's... not exactly like being a slave, Heidi.
Heidi: Yes it is! Am I being paid to judge the science fair? No. Do I have a choice? No. "Ohhh, yes masah. Lemme judge that science fair for ya, suh!"
Theresa: God, will you stop?!
Heidi: Theresa, don't get all aggro on me because you're pissed off your family lives in a trailer.
Theresa: My family doesn't live in a trailer. We live in a tiny home. My parents downsized to make a smaller footprint on the environment.
Heidi: That's what I said. Your family lives in a trailer.
Theresa: There's lots of progressive people living in tiny homes. There's five others on my block.
Heidi: Right. That's called a "trailer park."
Theresa: A-hi don't live in a trailer park!
Heidi: I'll try, but she's such a bitch.
Isla: She wasn't talking to you, Heidi.
Heidi: Oh, looks like Isla has something to say, you guys. Hold on, I'm sure this is going to be really profound. Go ahead, Isla, knock us out with you wit and satire. This should be good, you guys.
Cartman: What are you up to?
Nathan: Well hello there, ladies.
Nelly: Oh, hi Nathan.
Nichole: Oh, cool.
Francis: Nathan! Mimallah! Yuh, you've gotta get to Special Ed!
Nathan: Special Ed class isn't for another two hours.
Francis: Nono, you've gotta see this! Jimmy and Timmy's water bears! They've changed!
Nathan: What?
Nathan: What's goin' on?
Jimmy: Nathan, it's amazing. The water bears we've trained are starting to display social advancements.
Jimmy: They've actually evolved to the point of doing the hokey pokey.
Steve: Boys, this might be the single greatest Special Ed Science Fair project I've ever seen!
Heidi: Butters.
Heidi: How would you like to be the judge for the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend?
Butters: Uhh, I can't. I'm going to a birthday party.
Cartman: Butters, don't be a dick!
Heidi: Yeah, don't make up excuses because judging handicapped students sounds terrible!
Cartman: Well then, could you invite Heidi, please? She needs an excuse not to have to go to the Special Needs Science Fair.
Heidi: Because nobody wants to be trapped, in a gym, with Special Ed Science.
Kyle: Actually, some of their projects are pretty cool.
PC Principal: Excuse me, can I help you?
Jerry Jones: We understand that you're about to have a science fair with some very interesting experiments.
PC Principal: That's right, the science fair is this Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm.
Jerry Jones: We're here to help however we can. Your special ed department has all our resources and all our support. This science fair... just might be what saves us all.
Heidi: What the hell is going on?! Everywhere I turn, people are being given handouts while I'm forced to work my ass off! It's total bullshit!
Cartman: Yeah... uh... Babe, uh I understand that you're pissed off, but, um, you know, it is recess. Maybe we should relax and have some fun?
Jerry Jones: Good. Bring it on in. These kids need to have access to everything they need.
Jimmy: Wow, look at this, Tim-Tim. They've all been researching water bears too.
Jimmy: That's right. The water bears we've been working with appear to be evolving somehow.
Jerry Jones: Then they are the key to our survival, boys.
Nathan: Gentlemen, perhaps I can interest you in a lava volcano. You won't believe your eyes when I add some simple baking soda.
Heidi: Fellow students, I have asked to speak today because of the hypocrisy and bullying that is coming from the administration at this so called... skewl. It is an outrage that our principal and counselor denand our participation in privileged programs that are outrageously overfunded. Why is it that the school allows funding that only goes to special needs students? Are the rest of us not special? If we are continually asked to work for no money and ask our parents to pay for our programs, then soon we will all be poor, and forced to live in a trailer park like Theresa.
Theresa: It's not a trailer!
Cartman: Uh, o-okay honey, you're kind of getting off-topic, sweetie.
Heidi: What did you say?!
Cartman: Uh just, uh-uhm, I just want you to stay on point so we can get this over with.
Heidi: GET THIS OVER WITH?! You're supposed to be supporting me!
Cartman: I am supporting you, sweetheart!
Heidi: Being supportive doesn't mean you criticize me, asshole! Just forget it! My point is, if the school administration doesn't cancel the science fair, I will see to it that they are all fired for discrimination!
PC Principal: Oh, dude. Bro.
Nathan: This is bullshit! The Special Ed Science Fair is turning into a lovefest for Jimmy and Timmy's project! They're gonna get all the fame and glory!
Mimsy: D'aw, I guess we kind of shot ourselves in the foot, huh boss? If it weren't for us, those water bears wouldn't have even gotten smarter in the first place.
Jimmy: Wha-what do you mean, Nathan?
Nathan: Mimsy and I did some experimenting with the water bears on our own.
Nathan: It was us who made them evolve, so we should be the ones working for the government.
Jerry Jones: The government? Wuh we aren't the government.
Jimmy: Yuh you're not the government? But you said you were here to help stop us from becoming extinct.
Jerry Jones: Not you, us. We're with... the NFL. Our fans are leaving at an exponential rate. We've been hit with anthem protests, protests of those protests, and worst of all, concussions. The more reports that come out, the more people are getting turned off by football. We've been experimenting with water bears because... we believe they are our last hope.
Jimmy: Oh, I get it. You've been experimenting with water bears to see how to make humans more impervious to concussions.
Jerry Jones: No. We've been experimenting with water bears to try and make them... FANS.
Sportscaster 1: A beautiful night for football here in Los Angeles as the Chargers take on the Buffalo Bills.
Sportscaster 1: The NFL, of course, working really hard to reach new viewers, and it looks like they found their answer in tardigrades.
Jerry Jones: What are the water bears doing?
Nathan: Uhhh, they're just walkin' around and ubb, oh wait! They appear to be interested in the box.
Owners: What? Cancelling?
Jerry Jones: You can't cancel the science fair. We're on the verge of a breakthrough here.
Heidi: It's cancelled. You guys can get all this shit out of here and leave. Thank you!
Jerry Jones: You don't understand! The Special Ed Science Fair is our only hope!
Jerry Jones: I think you all fail to see the seriousness of our situation! Football is dying!
Nathan: Oh! Uh okay, Jesus Christ!
Cartman: What the hell do you want me to do?!
Heidi: I want you to have some BALLS and act like you care about me!
Cartman: Heidi, you need to stop being such a bitch!
Cartman: You are... acting... like a... bad girlfriend.
Heidi: That's what I thought!
Nathan: Hey, uh wait a minute! The water bears have changed again. I think it's working.
Nathan: Wha-ah?
An owner: The water bears!
Cartman: Heidi! Heidi, will you please listen to me?!
Another owner: We got the fat girl, front of the school.
Heidi: I don't... have to listen... to anybody!
Cartman: Yes, yes you do! You need to listen!
Heidi: Fuck you!
Cartman: No, fuck you!
Jerry Jones: Little girl, please! What you have in your hand is very special.
Heidi: Well I'm sick of everyone treating me like shit!
Jerry Jones: Think about the NFL. How much joy it brings to everyone!
Nathan: Don't listen to them. Give the water bears to me. I deserve all the fame and bitches.
Cartman: Heidi, you've gotta stop being so angry.
Jerry Jones: Look, if you- if you don't do it for the NFL, what about humanity? Those creatures are showing the first signs of sentience. Think about what they could mean for science. For medicine. Making people better.
Cartman: Dude, wwow.
Cartman: No. I was just... trying to... figure out why you decided to drink 20,000 microanimals that were showing signs of intelligence.
Heidi: Whatever. It's Saturday, and I'm not in skewl.
Cartman: Yeah, you're, you're not in skewl.
Heidi: We used to snuggle all the time and it's totally gone away! What happened?!
Cartman: Well, but honey, we still-
Heidi: SNUGGLE!
Heidi: Goddammit, how come there's nothin' to watch on Saturday but kids cartoons?!
Cartman: Oh, what is goin' on in here?
Roger Goodell: Well, did you have any luck, Mr. Jones?
Jerry Jones: I'm afraid, Commissioner, that the Special Ed Science Fair failed to produce more viable water bears.
Officlal 1: Then the NFL truly has no hope.
Officlal 2: We're done for.
Terrance: Well, we were thinkin' that we'd do a show where Phillip and I are on a farm... with a cow.
President: And it's like a back and forth kind of thing? It's sort of like a-?
President: On you. Got it!
President: Welcome to Netflix, you sons of bitches. YEAH!
Terrance & Phillip: Hooray!
Craig: Come on, Tweek. Hurry!
Stan: What's going on?
Cartman: Honey, I wanna watch Terrance & Phillip with my friends!
Heidi: So then why can't I come?
Cartman: Terrance & Phillip is a guys' night thing, baby.
Wendy: Watching Heidi get her bitch-ass kicked!
Heidi: Fuck you, Wendy!
Craig: Don't take that crap, Heidi! Let Cartman have it!
Heidi: I love you too, babe.
Craig: Dammit.
Strong Woman: You really think I couldn't have handled that? Myself?
PC Principal: Oh. Uh, I was just making sure everything was uh-
Strong Woman: You really had to grab the mic out of my hand like that?
PC Principal: From everyone!
PC Principal: No. NO! Sorry, I thought I'd... add, just add for emphasis.
Strong Woman: You felt it wasn't strong enough? Me just saying it?
PC Principal: No-I, I'm... Uh, I'm sorry.
Strong Woman: I'm not finished!
Announcer 1: It's the Terrance & Phillip Sho-o-ow.
Phillip: Hey Terrance, what did the black lawyer say to the Muslim priest?
Stan: Come in!
Stan: It's just starting.
Heidi: Dude, that's awesome.
Kyle: For the first time I feel kind of bad for the person being farted on.
Cartman: Baby, I fuckin' love you so much.
Mr. Mackey: Uhm'kay.
Mr. Mackey: Excuse me uh, I'm sorry, but uh, is anyone else hearing Hootie & The Blowfish like, very very softly?
Substitute Teacher: Yeah, yeah, I hear it.
Doctor: Hello there, misterr... Principal, is it?
PC Principal: That's right, I'm PC Principal.
Doctor: Hm what's bringing you in today?
PC Principal: I'm uh... having this problem with my ears. There's like a persistent kind of ahh ringing going on.
PC Principal: It's um, Hootie & The Blowfish.
PC Principal: Yeah, uh, ahem, there's a new woman that has joined our faculty. Her name is Strong Woman, and uh, she seems to have set off some kind of device in my ears.
Doctor: So maybe you're having some feelings for her.
PC Principal: No, that couldn't be it. We work in the same place, so it would be impossible for me to like her. I'm thinking there's some sort of device in my ears.
Doctor: Well, I looked, and Hootie & The Blowfish aren't in your ears. I believe you're hearing them in your mind and your heart.
PC Principal: Oh, dude. Bro.
Kyle: Vice Principal Woman?
Kyle: My name's Kyle, and I've been doing a lot of changing lately. I came because I might be able to offer some... insight into our problem here.
Strong Woman: Please, by all means.
Kyle: You see, there's a culture at this school that embraces meanness, and I believe now that it comes from a Canadian TV show. All the boys watch it. I did too. We all laughed while they... farted... on innocent people's heads. The thing is, I never felt for the person being farted on. Until now. I want to work with you to open people's eyes, because I get it now.
Kyle: What?
Strong Woman: I mean, it's a slippery slope when we start pointing the finger at our own shortcomings.
Kyle: But, but I thought for sure YOU would be on my side.
Strong Woman: Kind of sounds like something my mother would say, actually.
Kyle: Rrrrr!
Mr. Mackey: You wanted to see me, PC Principal?
PC Principal: Uh YES. Yes, Mackey, um, I just wanted to see how you thought it was going with Strong Woman.
Mr. Mackey: Well, she seems to be acclimating fine, ukay, the kids really respect her.
PC Principal: Do you know, uh, [begins to fumble on his words] Do you know if Strong Woman has a boyfriend?
Mr. Mackey: What??
Mr. Mackey: Are you out of your fuckin' mind?! Askin' if a coworker is available in today's times?!
PC Principal: I just wanted to know because she's unavailable, then maybe I can get my head off of her, alright?
Mr. Mackey: Oh boy, this is bad! This is real bad!
Mr. Mackey: Look, this is real fucking fire you're dealing with, uhkay?! I'm gonna get someone down here from HR!
PC Principal: HR? Is that like... Hootie Removal?
Mr. Mackey: No! Human resources! The people that come in to make sure everything's kept on the level! We gotta get you back on track!
Anchor Tom: Is Canada a bad influence on the United States? A group of young people called "Millennials Against Canada" thinks so, and we are joined by their leader, Kyle Broflovski.
Kyle: Thanks for having me, Tom.
Anchor Tom: Young man, you say Canada is to blame for most of our problems.
Kyle: All I'm saying is that there's a culture that originates from Canada which is at least partly to blame for the state of our country now.
Anchor Tom: To respond to this we're now joined by the Canadian Minister of Streaming.
Minister of Streaming: Thanks for having me, buddeh.
Anchor Tom: Minister, how do you answer to these angry millennials?
Minister of Streaming: Well, they're pissed off because their country sucks, so they wanna point the finger at us.
Kyle: I'm saying we're all guilty too. I grew up watching Terrance & Phillip, and I thought it was funny.
Minister of Streaming: So you thought it was funny, but now it's not funny?
Kyle: No, it was never funny. I see it differently now.
Minister of Streaming: Oh, so you want to censor it.
Kyle: We don't wanna censor it, we just wanna... get rid of it.
Minister of Streaming: Uh huh, you sound like a Jewish mother.
Kyle: Oh, see? That's what I'm talking about, right there! That kind of mean, degrading, Canadian trash!
Minister of Streaming: Now I resent that! I find that racist-
Kyle: Canadians should care about the rest of the world!
Minister of Streaming: You are a racist, fwiend, and if you have a problem with Canada, maybe you should speak to your backwards President!
Kyle: Maybe I will!
Minister of Streaming: 'Kay, go ahead!
Kyle: Maybe I know the President!
Minister of Streaming: Oh, sure you do! Just like all Jewish moms, 'cause you don't understand how-
Kyle: Stop calling me that!
Minister of Streaming: Can I finish?!
Kyle: That's all you know is how to be mean-
Minister of Streaming: That's not a- Can I finish, please?!
Kyle: Because you were all raised on it yourselves!
PC Principal: Alright, everyone. Listen up. As you know, we want to provide a safe work environment for all our employees. Sometimes feelings do arise and we are tempted by the Devil to act upon them. So we've been reaching out to Human Resources division as I think we can all use someone to tell us about what is and isn't considered misconduct. She has some great advice for us, so please welcome Heather Conduct. Go ahead, Miss Conduct.
Miss Conduct: Hello, everyone, my name is Miss Conduct. I'm hear to talk about making sure we avoid any trouble at this school. M'alright?
Phillip: Well hello there, little girl.
Terrance: Are you selling Girl Scout cookies?
Girl: Well yes I am. How about a Snickerdoodle?
Terrance: Didn't think I'd live long enough to see this all happen again.
Anchor Tom: More and more millennials are turning into Jewish mothers today as they demand the censorship of entertainment. The protesters say they're not giving up and are demanding to speak with the President of the United States.
Kyle: Oh, I'm sorry I'm taking a stand and doing something. I realize this doesn't gel with your nihilism!
Stan: Okay, dude. I didn't wanna have to say this, but you're really starting to sound like your mom.
Kyle: I'm not like my mom! I'm gonna make a difference! It's gonna feel real good!
Mr. Mackey: Mr. Mackey.
Miss Conduct: Now, did you have a nice night?
Mr. Mackey: Yeah, yeah it was good.
Miss Conduct: M'alright. Okay. Uh good luck today, and I hope that our workin' relationship can continue to be honest and straightforward.
Mr. Mackey: Oh, ah I'm very open and honest, I promise you that.
Mr. Mackey: Oh, I mostly use a semi-cognitive approach adapted by Kiezrick Solomon.
Miss Conduct: Wow, you studied Solomon? He was actually my thesis in college.
Mr. Mackey: Are you serious? Nobody I talked to has ever even heard of him!
Miss Conduct: No! Same here! What made you attracted to his work?
Mr. Mackey: Well it's just such a na-natural approach, m'kay?
Miss Conduct: M'alright, m'alright.
Mr. Mackey: When I read it, you know, first I was like "whoa, okay!"
Miss Conduct: M'alright.
Mr. Mackey: "This just really makes sense", you know?
Mr. Mackey: Mmmm'kay
Minister of Streaming: Mr. President! You need to do something about your millennials!
Minister of Streaming: Terrance & Phillip are Canada's largest export! They account for 80% of our gross national product! If your citizens mess with them, they mess with all of us!
Garrison: Look, I'm President of the United States. I can't get involved in every petty little protest against a third-world country.
Garrison: Are you threatening us, you beady-eyed Canuck?
Minister of Streaming: I'm simply telling you that Canada will do what it must to protect itself!
Garrison: Then I guess both our countries better be prepared.
Miss Conduct: M'alright, m'alright, I definitely get that, m'alright.
Miss Conduct: No, I agree, I agree, the city's bad. I love hikin' too. What are some of your favorite places?
Mr. Mackey: Well, you know, Mt. Evens is always nice.
Strong Woman: What the hell is that?
Kyle: The National Guard?
Kyle: Yes. This is Millennials Against Canada.
Garrison: Yeah, listen, this thing's kind of escalating. You people need to call it quits.
Kyle: We can't do that, Mr. President. Someone has to do what's right.
Garrison: What exactly do you want?
Kyle: What do I want? I want a world... where laughter doesn't come at someone else's expense. Where people can live freely without fear of being farted on. I want a world where you aren't ridiculed for trying to help. A world where a nice girl that I liked isn't turned into another Eric Cartman! These Canadians are in the way of that world, and everything they do and everything they have done needs to be erased from the Earth!
Garrison: Jeez, I got a little chub.
Strong Woman: Let's go! Everyone to the gymnasium now!
Strong Woman: I'm coming too. I'm your vice principal.
Strong Woman: What's wrong?
PC Principal: Vice Principal Woman, I need to ask you something.
Strong Woman: Okay?
PC Principal: This is very difficult, but, uh...
Strong Woman: What? What?
Strong Woman: Yes, there is.
PC Principal: I would like to open this door for you. However, I understand the gender-based biases this can imply.
Strong Woman: Why do you need to open the door?
PC Principal: I don't need to open the door. I'd just be opening it and holding it the same way I would for Counselor Mackey, a student, anyone else.
Strong Woman: Somebody's gonna have to open the door, or we could die out here.
Crystal: Mommy! Momm-mmy! [her bedroom door opens and her parents walk in. Her dad flicks on the lights] He's gonna get me!
Bob White: Honey, honey, who's gonna get you?
Crystal: The President! I saw him! He's gonna get me!
Bob White: Crystal, the President isn't going to get you.
Crystal: But I saw him!
Bob White: [to his wife] See what I told you? It's that liberal school she's going to, filling her head with all kinds of garbage! Sweetie, the President is doing the best job he can. Your liberal school is just trying to convince you he's dangerous.
Crystal: But Daddy, he's getting-
Bob White: Uh uh, no buts! The President is in the White House, not here trying to get you. Okay?
Crystal: Oh-kaaay?
Bob White: All right. [he and Mom walk out the door, and he tells Mom] We're having a talk with that school in the morning! [turns to Crystal] Good night, honey. [turns off the lights, and the couple goes to their room. Thunder and lightning get Crystal out of bed and she goes to her window. She sees a shadow on the walkway outside. When lightning flashes, she sees it's indeed the President.]
Garrison: Hey! How are my approval ratings?! [Crystal runs back to bed]
Reporter: And the latest reports are now saying that over a million Canadians were killed in the nuclear blast. The bomb dropped by the U.S. President took out the entire city of Toronto, and fallout is expected to kill thousands more in the coming days. [A moment of silence follows, and Ike appears at Kyle's door.]
Kyle: Ike... Ike, I'm sorry that I caused a nuclear bomb to be dropped on Canada. I was just- you know, I was just trying to get shows that were toxic taken down. You know, those shows can be really harmful.
Ike: Ohhh, stop being a victim! Jesus Christ! [turns left and walks away. Kyle is left with his jaw dropped, then goes back to moping]
Bob White: What I wanna know is, what gives you the right to preach your political views to my children?! Our daughter woke up with nightmares that the President was going to get her! Just because two liberals happen to be principal and vice principal doesn't mean you can brainwash my kids!
PC Principal: Uh, we sort of have some bigger problems right now, Mr. Uh...
Bob White: It's White. Bob White. You probably never even heard of our family, huh? Well, the Whites have been here since the beginning! Not that it matters, 'cause no one cares about the Whites. Sure, everyone else has problems, but does anyone ask the Whites how they're doing?!
Strong Woman: Mr. White, we assure you that we run this school in a very [glances at PC Principal] professional manner and don't let [glances again] personal emotions get in the way. [glances again. He looks back, and their eyes are locked]
Bob White: Oh, sure you don't! You know how hard I had to fight to even get this meeting with you?! "Oh, who wants to talk to the administration? Oh, it's just the Whites? Oh, who cares about the Whites? They're fine!" Well, we've just about had with you, you understand? [a song plays that drowns out Mr. White's rant: Barbara Mandrell - "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right"] And damn it, we won't be ignored!
Mrs.White: [hearing the song somehow] I'm sorry, is anyone else hearing "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right" very very quietly?
Strong Woman: Uh, no. Mr. and Mrs. White, we promise that we will not let anything happen that might bring the integrity of this school into question.
Bob White: Guess that's all the Whites can hope for these days.
Garrison: Hey!
Tweek: Aaaagh!
Garrison: How are my approval ratings?
Tweek: It's the President! Gaaahhh! [rides away quickly]
Garrison: Wait, come back! What's wrong?
Bill Keegan: Still no word from the President, as his Splatty Tomato approval rating drops to an unprecedented 3%. This puts the President four points below Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature. Meanwhile, the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau called upon Canadians to stand strong.
Justin Trudeau: [stands behind a tattered podium with a Canadian flag on it.] Make no mistake, America! If you do not hand over your President, there will be war the likes of which you have never seen! Canadians will rise together! I call on all Canadians here and abroad to stand with their country! The U.S. President must answer for his crime, and only Canada can bring him to justice! [Trudeau himself was bombed, as he is charred and tattered as well. Ike, having seen the broadcast, gets angry and walks off]
Craig: [pats him on the shoulder] There there, Tweek. Everything is going to be okay.
Tweek: I saw what I saw, Craig! You have to believe me!
Kyle: [Him and Stan walk up with their bikes] What's going on?
Craig: Tweek's having a panic attack.
Tweek: It was real! He tried to get me!
Kyle: Who did?
Tweek: The President! [Stan looks away, as if Tweek's statement hit close to home]
Craig: It's just your imagination, Tweek.
Stan: It's not his imagination. I saw him too.
Kyle: You saw the President?
Stan: Out by the quarry. But I didn't believe it. I said, "How could this be..."
Heidi: ..."The President?" [Her and Cartman walk up with their bikes] I saw him too. He had a blue suit and an orange face. He kept asking me "How are my ap..."
Token: "...How are my approval ratings?" [walks up with his bike] I saw him too.
Stan: Dude, isn't this all really familiar? I saw something just like this on that show called Stranger...
Randy: [rides up on his bike] ...Stranger Things. Stranger Things is the show. I saw it too.
Craig: But wait, isn't Stranger Things just like that movie-?
Cartman: Just like that movie It.
Randy: You saw It too?
Cartman: Yeah, I saw It in the theater.
Token: I saw Stranger Things AND It.
Randy: Jesus. I don't think anyone's imagining anything. I think the President IS here. You kids get inside somewhere. I have to warn the town! [gets on his bike and rides off, only to fall on his face a few seconds later.] Aw!
Mayor McDaniels: All right, people. People, please! We need everyone to try and stay calm.
Townsman 1: How can we stay calm while the President's out there scaring our children?!
Mayor McDaniels: Look, we all want the President out of here. It's just a matter of how we do it. I know you all want to get rid of him.
Bob White: That's not true! The Whites still support the President
Randy: Oh, for fuck's sake, White, he's running around eating our pets and terrorizing our kids!
Bob White: You think Hillary would have been any better?!
Townsfolk: Aw! Come on! Sit down, Bob!
Bob White: [Sits down] I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
Mayor McDaniels: Listen, everyone. I have a team right now that's trying to locate the President, and I'd like you to hear from Officer Bright, who's leading the search. [the officer adjusts his pants and walks up to the podium]
Officer Bright: Hey folks, we know you're all uh concerned, but I wanna assure you that we're doing everything we can to track the President down and have him safely removed. Since the President was given a Splatty Tomato he's become very desperate and very dangerous. If you see the President, do not approach him. Do not try to reason with him. Most importantly, remember that this is the President, so you cannot shoot him. All right? You can't even talk about shooting him. Don't even... do any coy, satirical takes on shooting him. [the room stays silent] Okay, good. What we're trying to do here is just get the President to go away. We're gonna be handing out padlocks like this one [lifts one up for display] so everyone can lock up their garbage. If we don't feed the President, hopefully he'll just move on. Are there any questions?
Townsman 2: Can we talk about a friend shooting him if it's in sort of a sarcastic way?
Officer Bright: No, no, no. It's just best to avoid that kind of talk altogether. Remember, they can do to you what they did to Kathy Griffin.
Randy: Make her not funny for thirty years?
Officer Bright: That's right, so best thing is just lock up your garbage and see if we can get the President to... go away.
Stan: Jesus. Now kids are going missing.
Tweek: We're all going to be missing soon! Nyaaarg!
Stan: [notices Kyle across the street walking by] Kyle! [the kids walk up to him]
Kyle: It's my fault. Ike went to go take matters into his own hands. I have to find him.
Craig: We'll help you.
Stan: We'll all help you.
Cartman: Guys this could be very dangerous.
Heidi: You're not going. You promised that tonight, we would have a date night.
Cartman: Darling this is a little more pressing than date night.
Heidi: Oh great. So Kyle's stupid brother goes missing, and I get fucked. How come I'm always the one getting shit on around here?
Kyle: I don't need anyone to go with me.
Heidi: Oh what's the matter, Kyle? Don't want me around because you had the hots for me and I shut you down?
Kyle: I would never have the hots for the person you are now.
Stan: Come on you guys. Look, we all know what we're supposed to do now We all saw "It" and "Stranger Things". We need to get our backpacks and go out to the woods and save the town from evil to some kick-ass '80s' music!
Waiter: Hello, joining us for lunch today?
PC Principal: Uh, yes. We are here with our student of the day to reward him lunch with the principal and vice principal.
Waiter: Okay, last name?
Strong Woman: Woman.
Waiter: First name?
Strong Woman: [Takes a deep breath] Strong.
Waiter: Oh, yes, Strong Woman, here we are. We have a nice booth set up for you.
Strong Woman: We can't keep doing this. People are gonna see through it.
PC Principal: Is it my fault that I found the most amazing, perfect, beautiful woman...at work?
Strong Woman: Nobody will understand.
PC Principal: Maybe they will. We're co-worker who are in love. You really think that's going to bother people?
Butters: Well, should we order now?
Randy: What are you doing, Bob?
Bob White: Aah!
Randy: [Randy is joined by Steven, Linda, Sharon and Roger] Have you been putting food out for the president?
Bob White: No, I was just, uh, taking these sandwiches to the trash.
Randy: We all agreed not to feed him so he'd go away.
Randy: Bob, come on. You have to know it's not safe to have him here.
Bob White: In 2003, Hillary Clinton admitted to taking funds for her foundation from foreign diplomats!
Randy: What's that got to do with anything, Bob? Come on.
Bob White: It's fucking true!
Randy: Bob, if Canada finds out the president is hiding here, they are going to nuke us. He needs to go.
Bob White: Hillary wouldn't have been any better.
Randy: Give me the finger sandwiches.
Bob White: Fine! Go ahead and take the White's sandwiches! They've taken everything else!
Stan: Due, this is '80's' music?
Craig: Yeah. It's Pandora. '80s' channel.
Stan: Well, just skip to the next song, man. We're trying to get psyched to destroy evil. We need better '80s' music than that.
Cartman: Heidi? Honey, what are you doing?
Heidi: This is the place... This is the place where I ended it all, remember? This is where I threw my phone of the bridge and quit Twitter for good. [The camera pans to the left to show Heidi's ghost] I was so different then... so naive and hopeful. [The ghost throws the phone in the river after tweeting her final goodbye]
Cartman: Yes honey, now can we get going, please?
Heidi: I'm sorry! I'm trying to have a moment here! This is where our whole relationship started asshole!
Cartman: Yes, it's very touching, sweetheart. I love you so much. [Quietly] I'm sorry about this, you guys.
Heidi: [The ghost turns to face herself] I remember feeling like I had nobody. Skinny bitch.
Kyle: We need to keep going guys.
Mayor McDaniels: Don't tell me you haven't gotten the President out of here.
Officer Bright: We haven't gotten the president out of here. And there's some worse news. A bunch of kids have gone missing.
Mayor McDaniels: What?
Officer Bright: I think we have to assume that the President has... eaten them. [Mrs Tweak starts crying]
Mayor McDaniels: Why are you here talking to me instead of trying to find the President?
Officer Bright: Don't worry, we're close. He's out in the woods somewhere. And we've set up a fox trap.
Garrison: Oh, Fox News... They'll listen to me. They'll get my side of the story right!
Bob White: [He whistles the bird call of the bobwhite quail to get Garrison's attention] It's a trap!
Garrison: What?
Bob White: It's a Fox trap, Mr. President!
Garrison: Oh, thank God for the Whites.
Kyle: Ike! Ike?
Stan: Dude, come on! This is not kick-ass '80s' music!
Craig: "Hold On to the Nights" Richard Marx, 1988.
Tweek: Do we really need music?
Craig: Oh, yeah. That's better.
Kyle: Can we go please?!
Kyle: Here it is. [Opens the door] Ike?
Heidi: Wait a minute... Isn't this the place you brought me before? The place you said your friends smashed your phone and computer...? I remember I felt so bad for you. We used to sit in the part and talk for hours. How come we never do that anymore?
Cartman: Oh, fuck. Here we go.
Heidi: Here we go what?! You used to be so nice to me.
Cartman: You used to be nice to me!
Heidi: I tired! But then you started rolling your eyes every time I tried to talk to you!
Cartman: Ughhhh...
Kyle: He's not here either.
Craig: Dude, maybe your brother didn't even go looking for the President.
Kyle: You don't understand Canadians. They're fiercely loyal to their country. When Canada is attacked, they all join in the fight.
Jimbo: Randy! Randy!
Randy: What?
Jimbo: They got him! They found the President!
Officer Bright: We found his hideout. There. Someone's gotta go flush him out. I'll be ready to trap him.
Randy: I'll do it.
Officer Bright: Hey, hey! Just remember he's been eating animals and living like a monster. Just... prepare yourself for what you're about to see.
Strong Woman: Oh my God!
Randy: What the... Principal and Vice Principal...?
Strong Woman: I told you we couldn't hide.
Randy: But... But you two work togeth... You two work togeth... [Vomits]
Officer Bright: Hey, what the hell's going on?!
Linda Black: Who's together?
Randy: The Principal and the Vice Principal!
Steven: They can't be together! They're co-workers!
Offier Bright: Wait, wait. You mean he's actually her superior and they were in there... [Gags, then vomits]
Steven: Who would want to put their penis in a co-worker?! [Gags then vomits. Everyone else starts doing the same]
Kyle: Oh, my God! Look! These are Ike's toy binoculars! He was here! Ike!
Heidi: I remember this place too... This is where you brought me on Halloween. Remember?
Cartman: [Sarcastically] Yes, darling, wasn't it romantic
Heidi: No! It wasn't romantic. There was a witch and you had me dress up like Gretel and... [gasps] you were trying to get me killed!
Cartman: Sweetheart, you made me late to the pumpkin patch, remember? I was hurt.
Cartman: I'm glad you understand.
Cartman: Heidi, I think spooky walk in the woods is making you lost it a little bit.
Stan: Guys!
Garrison: I'm seriously dehydrated and starving. I'm pretty sick of this shit, so you better... Aah!
Mr. Turner: Have we already done a search of this area? Maybe she went there with her boyfriend!
Mrs. Turner: She would have called by now.
Laura: I just talked to the McCormicks. They haven't seen Tweek or Craig since yesterday.
Sharon: Randy! Did you find anything?
Randy: [He takes off his hood] Sharon... I... I...
Sharon: What is it? What did you find?
Randy: The... There's... Ugh...
Sharon: Tell me! You have to tell me! [Officer Bright takes off his hat] Oh, God! What did you see?!
Randy: You don't want to know.
Sharon: You have to tell me! I can take it! Did you find our son's arm? Did you find him torn apart? What?!
Randy: The Principal and Vice Principal are, like... together. [Sharon vomits right onto Randy's face.] Aw!
Officer Bright: It's the President! [People begin to cheer]
Sheila: Ike! Kyle!
Sharon: Stan, you're okay!
Stan: Yeah, we're okay!
Officer Bright: We got him. We got the son of a bitch. [Bob White walks over and grabs Officer Bright's gun]
Bob White: Get back! Everyone back! Do it now! Get over here, family!
Randy: Bob, for the love of Pete, our country is about to go to war!
Bob White: You wanna know where there's a war?! There's a war on Christmas! Nobody cares about that! 'Cos guess who loves Christmas? The Whites! At least this man's trying to save Christmas!
Garrison: [Muffled] That's true!
Randy: He's not saving Christmas, Bob. He's running around scaring your kids and shitting in the woods.
Bob White: [Sighs, sobs]
Randy: Come on, Bob. What's best for your daughter? I mean, really?
Heidi: [Heidi grabs White's gun] You piece of shit! This was all your fault! [She points the gun at Cartman] You controlled me and manipulated me and turned me into this!
Cartman: Baby, put down the gun, sweetheart, okay?
Heidi: I used to be kind. I used to be caring. But then you... you... No. Not you. Me. I did this. I let being a victim become a way of life. If you always make yourself the victim, you can justify being awful. Eric... I'm sorry. I'm breaking up with you.
Cartman: Honey, don't be ridiculous.
Heidi: I've been ridiculous. I have to learn to stop feeling sorry for myself.
Cartman: Heidi, you are not breaking up with me.
Heidi: Yes, I am. It's over.
Cartman: I'm afraid I can't let you do that, sweetheart! [He grabs the gun and points it at himself] Step back! I'll do it I swear to God!
Heidi: It's not gonna work this time, Eric.
Cartman: You break up with me, I will kill myself! The choice is yours, Heidi! Come on everybody! "Eric, we don't want you to die."
Heidi: I'm sorry. You can be the victim. I can't.
Cartman: Heidi! Heidi, I'm gonna do it! Here we go! Heidi? Are you seriously...
Officer Bright: He broke free!
Jimbo: The President is on the loose again.
Officer Bright: He'll be even more desperate now. It's going to get worse.
Stan: We can't destroy him, can we?
Randy: I don't know. I guess... It's up to the Whites.
Cartman: Oh man!
Token: They're the denominators, so they stay a 4.
Cartman: Wait, wait, Token got an A? But I cheated off Token!
Mrs. Nelson: Ah I can't hear you, Eric.
Cartman: I said, something's wrong! I got an F but I cheated off Token!
Mrs. Nelson: And now we divide, right?! Craig, how about you?! What are we dividing?!
Craig: Divide 4 by 6? ["Report now!"]
Mrs. Nelson: The 4 by the 6?!
Mrs. Nelson: Or the 6 by the 4?!
Kyle: The 6 by the 4!
SWAT officer 1: Southwest classroom, clear! ["Copy. Southwest classroom, clear."]
Mrs. Nelson: Now we're gonna retake the exam on Friday.
Class: AWWW!
Mrs. Nelson: Now, I'm giving you an opportunity to do better. I hope you take advantage of it.
Mrs. Nelson: Eric, that's enough! ["Shooter is down, shooter is down"] Now, let's move on to the next equation.
Cartman: That is such bullshit, you guys! Token knew I was cheating offa him, so he deliberately put down the wrong answers! Why would he do that?!
Stan: I flunked that test too. I don't understand fractions - they don't make any sense.
Cartman: That's not the point, you guys! Why is Token out to get me? There's something going on here.
Bill Keegan: Another school shooting today has left students in shock and disbelief.
Kyle: Yeah, Token's probably sick of you cheating off him all the time.
Cartman: But why now? That's the question, Kyle. I always cheat off Token. Why did he choose now to hurt me?
Stan: Uh, hey mom.
Cartman: Dude, what's up Stan's mom's ass?
Sharon: Stanley? Well? Do you wanna tell your father about what happened at school today?
Sharon: Noo, the other thing!
Sharon: Yes, the school shooting!
Stan: Oh yeah, some kid shot up the school.
Stan: No.
Randy: Did you get shot?
Stan: No.
Randy: I'm sorry, Sharon. I...
Stan: What's up Mom's ass?
Sharon: No, I'm not okay! Children were shot! They were killed at a school where they were supposed to be safe!
Randy: Uh huh, and... what else is goin' on?
Sharon: Why isn't anyone else emotional?!
Sharon: Don't you dare suggest that I'm only emotional because it's-
Randy: I mean, I'm just, I'm just pointing out that it is around that time.
Sharon: GET OUT, RANDY! I'M NOT OVERREACTING!
Token: I actually never saw Black Panther.
Token: No, I didn't see it.
Cartman: Token, let's be honest with each other, okay? Why else would you manipulate my test grades?
Cartman: There was a test. I should have got an A on it, but Token did things to make me fail, and it's not fair.
Mr. Mackey: M'kay, m'kay, who's shootin' up the school?
PC Principal: Is that true, Token? Did you do somethin' to make Eric fail a test?
Cartman: You didn't make me fail the test and you didn't see Black Panther. Right.
Mr. Mackey: Everyone down!
An officer: Active shooter, active shooter!
Cartman: I mean, I mean, this is ridiculous.
Stephen: Red?
Randy: I agree with my wife.
Laura: Well, there certainly are things that need changing. Just yesterday, I was at the park with my son Craig and... have you seen the state of the playground equipment? Not only does it seem unsafe, but it's become quite an eyesore.
Ryan: The whole park could use an upgrade, if you ask me. It's become a campout for the homeless.
Randy: ...Anybody need a drink?
Cartman: Butters, I need help. My mom says if I flunk another math test, she's gonna ground me from playing Fortnite.
Butters: Oh, Jeez, want me to help you study?
Cartman: No, dumbass, I need to get some dirt on Token so he stops punishing me for what I supposedly said about Black Panther.
Butters: Well, what do you want me to do? I got hall monitor duty.
Cartman: Just ask around. If you find any dirt on Token, give me a call.
Stephen: It's all right, Randy.
Randy: It's just. it's just once I'd like her to acknowledge it, you know? Just once say "You know, maybe I was overreacting a little bit 'cause of my hormones."
Sharon: What is "cool" about that?!
Randy: Nuh-nothing. I love you, sweetheart.
Randy: I don't know. I don't know how much more of this I can take. It's like, I turn on the TV and dread they'll say something about a school shooting because it's gonna set my wife off.
Stephen: Well Randy, have you stopped to think that maybe this problem is bigger than Sharon's period?
Stephen: I mean that maybe what's going on really is a big deal. What if this is actually... menopause?
Randy: Menopause? I don't even know what that is.
Randy: Uh huh. But... if a woman isn't having periods anymore, then why would she still overreact and be bitchy?
Paramedic: Well actually, menopause is one of the most severely hormonal times a woman ever goes through. It's good you sought the advice of a medical professional, because the changes in your wife's body are gonna be confusing and at times hard to cope with.
Randy: Well wait, you're saying this could actually get worse?
Nichole: 'Bout what?
Cartman: Word on the street is you and Token are back together.
Nichole: We're trying, just talking a lot and seeing if we can work things out.
Cartman: Why did you break up with him? What did he do to you?
Nichole: I don't know what you're talking about.
Cartman: Oh no? When you guys talk about how sweet Black Panther was, what's he say?
Nichole: We've never talked about it.
Cartman: Right. You two guys just hang out and talk, and Black Panther never comes up. Why are you covering for Token? What's he have on you?
Cartman: Hello, Mom and Dad.
Sharon: I keep thinking... When will be the time when I get the call? You know? When will I answer the phone and find out my son, my daughter, were... killed? At school?
Doctor: Mmmhmm. Yeah I see.
Sharon: I live in constant fear that I won't be there to protect my children when something happens to them.
Doctor: Well, Sharon, have you maybe considered that your feelings are partly due to... handkerchief balls?
Sharon: What I'm saying is that I'm so overwhelmed that I-
Cartman: Yeah. yeah yeah, I know. You know, my other favorite part was when Black Panther had those dreams about his dead father. I mean the dad, the tribal leader, speaking to the new king about being a good leader. I've never seen a movie do that before, except for Lion King, of course, but Black Panther was so original.
Steve: We enjoyed it, yes.
Cartman: So, uh, what was Token's favorite part of Black Panther?
Linda Black: Token?
Token: Get out of my house!
Cartman: Token.
Cartman: Sure thing. You know, we were just talking about how your family did see Black Panther.
Steve: Oh, no not the family. Token's mom and I saw it on date night. We're gonna watch it again with Token, though. We don't let him watch it alone because it's PG-13.
Linda: Well, Token wouldn't do that.
Harriet Biggle: Sharon, Sharon, you have to come quick!
Sharon: What is it?
Linda Stotch: There's another shooting happening at the school right now!
Harriet: It just started. Maybe we can make it in time!
Sharon: Come on, we have to hurry!
Linda: No, Sharon. You go ahead first.
Sharon: Why??
Cartman: Oh hay, man. The big math quiz is about to start. You gonna let me cheat off you?
Token: Nnnope.
Cartman: You saw Black Panther without your parents' permission. I typed up all my findings, Token. I made ten copies and put them in envelopes. If I don't pass this math quiz, the envelopes are all set to be sent to ten different news organizations.
Token: You did all that instead of actually studying for the test?
Cartman: So, what's it gonna be, Token? You can be mad I didn't like Black Panther, but you can't take it out on me anymore.
Token: I didn't see Black Panther.
Cartman: Then I guess your parents won't be mad when they read my report.
Cartman: In poker they call it a bluff. I know that right now, Token is shitting his pants. All I need to do now is wait for the poop to stink.
Cartman: Token, we are running out of time. If you don't let me cheat off you, I'm going to tell your parents that you saw Black Panther in the theater without them!
Token: Ii didn't see Black Panther in the theater!
Cartman: Of course you did, Token! That's why me ripping on it pissed you off so much!
Butters: Wull it's the entire glee club this time!
Cartman: Butters, I have to get to class! The math quiz is starting!
Butters: Oh crap! The math quiz? It's already fourth period?
Cartman: I can't flunk this math quiz, Butters! Cover me!
Randy: How long does it last?
Officer Stevens: You did everything you could, Mr. Marsh. If your wife can't realize the truth and appreciate you, maybe she never will.
Sharon: Realize what?! What have you been telling everybody, RANDY?!
Stephen: Randy was just trying to make you feel loved while you're going through menopause.
Sharon: Menopause?! I'm not going through fucking menopause!
Stephen: How do you know?
Sharon: I just got my period this morning!
Randy: You... you got your period?
Sharon: YES!
Randy: You just got your period this morning?
Sharon: YES!
Randy: Soooo the past few days, maybe you have been just a liiittle-
Sharon: NO! NO NOTHING! Don't you guys see what's happened here?! I want you to be angry! Every day we hear about another school shooting! It used to be a big deal! I want it to be a big deal again. I mean Harriet, you came to my house and said there was a school shooting to trick me into going with you!
Harriet: I was just trying to be a part of the big surprise, Sharon.
Sharon: That's what I'm talking about! That's crazy, Harriet! I want you all to be shocked! I want you all to be sad!
Townsman: You want everyone to be sad?
Cartman: What do you mean?
Randy: Sure, honey.
Sharon: There's been... too much pain and suffering, and... it has to stop.
Randy: I know, sweetheart, I know.
Sharon: What I'm trying to say is... I've been very emotional lately, and... maybe... maybe I do overreact sometimes.
Sharon: Maybe I need to realize that my emotions can be hormonal and not just take things out on you.
Randy: Aaah? Aaaaah?
Sharon: Randy, I'm... sorry.
Randy: What is it?
Sharon: There's been another school shooting. Stan's been shot.
Randy: Shuh-should we get down there?
Randy: Come on, guys, we don't wanna be late!
Randy: Church is important, Stan. Way more important than video games and TV. Church is about community and coming together. A lot of things.
Sharon: All I know is that after church I feel better.
Randy: Yeah. Me too.
Randy: Hey, mornin' Stephen, Linda.
Townsman: Aww thanks there, Randy.
Randy: You got it- hey, where's Josie?
Townsman: Oh, she slipped her disc in her neck. Poor thing can barely move.
Fr. Maxi: Uh Okay, okay, let's, let's try and have none of that today. In John 3:16, the Gospel tells us how God so loved the world he gave to us his only Son
Fr. Maxi: Okay, okay, Co-come on guys, Nu-now, what greater gift could the Lord has given to us?
Fr. Maxi: Okay, let's, let's try to compose ourselves. Let's try and just get through this first one, okay guys? What does it mean that the Lord gave us his only begotten Son?
Randy: Oh, that was a great one, Nelson. Salvation in a little boy's mouth. I'm gonna post that one for sure.
Woman 2: Who said the thing about naked boy salad?
Stephen: Oh that was Linda!
Others: Yeah, see ya! See ya! Bye.
Stan: I really don't understand the point of all that.
Stan: But back then I don't know if church was that stupid.
Randy: Hey, don't say things like that, Stan! You wanna go to fuckin' Hell?
Butters: Father, can I talk to you?
Fr. Maxi: Oh, of course, my child. What's troubling you?
Fr. Maxi: Well, we can't all walk away. The-the priesthood is all I know. I, I dedicated my entire life to it. Ah I don't know anything else.
Butters: I know it seems impossible. I thought I'd be a punching bag my whole life. but now, I'm one of the popular kids. I even get invited to board night at Stan's house. My point is, sometimes, y-you just gotta put yourself out there.
Cartman: I wanna be Calamity Jame this time.
Stan: How many cards do you start with, Kenny?
Kyle: Oh, there's Butters!
Stan: Okay, so I-I guess I'm gonna go to the saloon and try to arrest Cartman.
Cartman: Let's see what you got, bitch.
Butters: So, Kyle, did you know Father is a really good singer? You like to sing too, don't you?
Kyle: No.
Fr. Maxi: Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant.
Butters: Aw, Father, wait a-
Fr. Maxi: I should go.
Randy: Aw shit, I missed it!
Butters: Come on, Father, you can't give up so fast.
Fr. Maxi: This is just gonna make things way worse. People will rip on me.
Butters: Who cares? Who cares what people say?
Fr. Maxi: I do.
Butters: Aw, come on, you gotta be strong!
Butters: Because I was you. Okay? I wasn't always this cool. I've been through it. But then one day, somebody told me something. he said "life is full of love and light and bountiful things," and you know who told me that? you did! Two years ago, in church! You have a right to go and be happy! And if people wanna keep tryin' to knock you down, well, fuck 'em!
Randy: Hey, mornin' Mackey!
Mr. Mackey: Well Happy Sunday! Mornin' Ted, Hazel.
Ted: Mornin'.
Hazel: Morning.
Randy: Ah, doin' better, huh, Josie?
Josie: A lot better. Thank you.
Randy: Hey! Hey, it's nine o'clock! Hey!
Randy: Well this sucks. What are we supposed to do without church?
Sharon: I just feel so empty.
Shelley: What are you guys so upset about?
Randy: Shut up, Shelley!
Butters: Isn't this great, Father? Fresh mountain air, a nice warm fire, a nice warm fire.
Fr. Maxi: I have to admit it's a pretty nice way to spend a Sunday. How many are your works, Lord? In wisdom you made them all.
Butters: Yeah, the Lord is pretty cool.
Fr. Maxi: He is. Because he brought me you.
Archbishop: Denver archdiocese. The Lord be with you.
Mr. Mackey: Well, it's not suspicious, we just kind of don't know what to do, you know? Uh.
Auxiliary: Don't worry, Your Holiness. By the time we're done with that town there won't be a lick of cum anywhere.
Fr. Maxi: For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works.
Clyde: Dude, what are you talking about?!
Kyle: Just leave it alone, Clyde. Butters brings him everywhere.
Fr. Maxi: I don't care, I don't want a fucking priest at my birthday party!
Butters: That's it! You're doing great!
Randy: What's it all about, huh? Are we just bags of carbon and water put on this planet for no purpose? You're born, you die, then you're just... food for the worms.
Stuart: It all does seem pretty meaningless.
Jimbo: What?
Randy: The church is back open?
Townsman 3: Oh boy! Let's go let's go let's go let's go!
Others: The church is back open! Thank God! Let's go!
Auxiliary: Scrub everything! Police can detect even a milligram of cum and rectal blood!
Auxiliary: Oh uh, hello my children. The Lord be with you.
Townsmen: And with your spirit.
Randy: What uh, what are you guys doing?
Auxiliary: Oh, we're just giving the place a nice scrub down while we wait for your priest to come back. He was called to South America last week.
Randy: Last week? No, he was at my house a couple of days ago playing board games with the boys.
Townsmen: Awww.
Auxiliary: Scrub everything. Bleach those board-game pieces. You find something on that chair?
Auxiliary: Well, just get rid of it. Bleach the entire top of the table. That's probably where he mounted them.
Stan: What are you doing?
Auxiliary: What are we doing about what?
Stan: Well, I mean, it looks like you're scrubbing and bleaching our tables and chairs.
Auxiliary: Mmm mmm, that's not what's going on. Your local priest was never here, actually.
Stan: Yeah he was. I played with him.
Stan: What's a Kumby?
Auxiliary: We're just here to cleanse your spirit, my child.
Boys: Yaaay!
Fr. Maxi: And now let us pray.
Boys: Awww.
Fr. Maxi: Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. which we are about to receive.
Clyde: Kyle, will you do something please?!
Kyle: Why me?
Fr. Maxi: ...through Christ our Lord. Amen.
Fr. Maxi: All right, my child.
Butters: Huh-what's up?
Kyle: Butters, you know, you can just bring your priest with you everywhere. I mean, sometimes the guys just wanna do stuff and not have a priest around.
Butters: What are you saying, Kyle?
Butters: Well, of course, you don't.
Auxiliary: All right, clean and scrub everything. I want it spotless! Get any evidence the priest might have left behind.
Auxiliary: It's an 8-year-old's birthday party. Of course, it's cum. Get the Kumby!
Cartman: Yeah, but he left with Butters.
Auxiliary: Tell me about this Butters.
Fr. Maxi: Just leave me alone.
Butters: But you're missin' the party!
Fr. Maxi: Stop defending me! There are things you don't know!
Butters: But it's not your fault.
Fr. Maxi: Yes it is! It is my fault!
Butters: Why?!
Butters: But... I thought we were pals.
Auxiliary: Hey. Hey there. What's the matter, my child? Did you know that Jesus loves you?
Butters: Sometimes I wonder.
Butters: ...No thanks.
Auxiliary: you like camping trips? You wanna go camping?
Butters: No.
Auxiliary: I got a bunny in the back. You wanna see the bunny?
Stan: I have no idea what's going on.
Fr. Maxi: Hello, Mr. Marsh.
Fr. Maxi: M, Mr. Marsh-
Randy: He's back!
Fr. Maxi: -please.
Randy: Hey, Father's back!
Fr. Maxi: I'm just going around trying to locate little Butters Stotch. I thought he might be here playing a board game with your son?
Randy: Oh uh, no. I haven't seen, Butters. Or Stan. But Father, please, we all need church.
Randy: Please, Father, we're all lost, and the cleanup crew hasn't helped at all.
Auxiliary: Any sign of him?
Assistant: No, but this should draw him out. The cute one says it's where he and the priest first got together.
Auxiliary: All right, when the priest gets here, we'll take care of him and then eradicate this place of any evidence.
Priest: Should I bring out the Kumby?
Stephen: Hey Randy, what's up?
Stephen: But where would priests go this late at night?
Linda: To a midnight sale at Boys 'R' Us?
Randy: What-what'd she say?
Stephen: She said, "To a midnight sale at Boys 'R' Us."
Randy: Can, can I post that?
Stephen: Sure, she doesn't care.
Stephen: Well yeah, we got a really weird text from him saying not to worry, he needed to do some camping.
Assistant: He's not showing up.
Kid's voice: I love Jeeesus! I love Jeeesus!
Priest: Yes, your Holiness.
Butters: Father.
Butters: What?? No!
Fr. Maxi: A transfer?
Auxiliary: The Church took care of everything, just like it always has from the beginning. "Thank you for cleaning up all my cum."
Fr. Maxi: I can just... go? I can start over in the Maldives?
Auxiliary: No one will make fun of you there. They can't even speak English. And don't worry, there'll be plenty of priests to take your place here. Look, I know it's a big change, but... you know what you have to do.
Fr. Maxi: Yes, I do. I don't think I have any other choice.
Butters: No. He can't.
Butters: Father, you did it!
Fr. Maxi: I'm so sorry, my child. I never meant to say we weren't pals.
Butters: Does that mean you're gonna stay?
Fr. Maxi: Of course. Now I have purpose, and I have meaning. My job here is to protect you. All of you.
Fr. Maxi: The Lord be with you.
Fr. Maxi: Today I'd like to talk on the subject of penance. The penitent... have deep remorse, but for true penance, we must be humble enough to admit that the Lord's forgiveness is undeserved.
Fr. Maxi: In Job 42:6 we read "Therefore, I reprehend myself and do penance in dust and ashes"
Fr. Maxi: So we are not to punish ourselves, but instead, we are to make ourselves passionate.
Randy: Oh God, it's good to have my faith back!
Fr. Maxi: Passionate to understand all that Christ sacrificed, and how hard it truly was.
Mayor McDaniels: People, it's time we faced some hard truths. The town is looking to us for answers, and all we keep doing is burying our heads. We need to cut the budget for this year's Christmas pageant.
Mayor McDaniels: I've asked the director of the holiday show to stop by so we can all give him the news.
Ryan: He's not going to take this well.
Councilwoman: If he doesn't, we should just let him go. God knows it's about time.
Mayor's aide: Hey, a lot of people like him, all right?
Mrs. Testaburger: Yeah, and a lot of people think he stinks.
Mr. Hankey: Hooooowwwdy ho! You wanted to see me? Better hurry. We only have two months before Christmas.
Mayor McDaniels: Mr. Hankey, we called you in to let you know that... your Christmas Pageant funding has been cut. By half.
Mr. Hankey: What? But I can barely make a good Christmas show with what I have!
Mayor McDaniels: We just don't have the support for the Christmas show that we used to. The truth is... some people find you offensive.
Mr. Hankey: Offensive? What about me is offensive?
Councilwoman: Some people think shit isn't the best representation of Christmas.
Mr. Hankey: Yuh... you people can't do this. Christmas is the most magical time of the year.
Mayor McDaniels: The decision has already been made. Thank you, Mr. Hankey, and good luck with the show.
Mr. Hankey: Okay, stop. Kids, the song's called "Deck The Halls," not "Let's All Suck Balls." Mow, come on, kids.
Craig: Why do we have to do this now?
Cartman: Yeah, it's not even Halloween yet.
PC Principal: Vice Principal Strong Woman?
Strong Woman: Yes, PC Principal?
PC Principal: I was seeing if there's anything you... might want to discuss with me?
Strong Woman: What would we need to discuss?!
PC Principal: I am- so sorry- that I took advantage of my position and- manipulated you into a physical encounter.
Strong Woman: Hey! I am a strong woman, all right?! I don't get manipulated! We both are guilty of an ill-advised relationship at the workplace, but that was long ago, and I have decided to move forward.
PC Principal: Are you sure we can move forward?
Strong Woman: Why not? We make a mistake, we move forward.
PC Principal: I was just thinking there might still possibly be some fallout from-
Strong Woman: Nope! We're just gonna forget about it and put it to rest.
PC Principal: You don't think there's anything else to dis- to discuss?
Stan: Dude, Kyle! Dude!
Cartman: Dude!
Kyle: What?
Stan: Did you read what Mr. Hankey tweeted last night?!
Kyle: What Mr. Hankey... tweeted?
Stan: Yeah. I guess after band rehearsals he went on Twitter to talk about us.
Kyle: Oh. Jesus Christ, dude.
Kyle: Mr. Hankey.
Mr. Hankey: Oh, Kyle! Hoowwwwdy ho!
Kyle: Mr. Hankey, everyone's really mad at you. Were you on Twitter last night?
Kyle: Did you tweet "The kids of South Park are retarded homos who can't play music"?
Kyle: Why would you tweet that?! All the kids are really pissed off!
Mr. Hankey: It was a bad attempt at a joke. I'm sorry. Will you tell the kids I didn't mean it?
Kyle: What do you want me to say?
PC Principal: All right, everyone, listen up. The vice principal has asked to speak with you today. She believes it is time that we all as a school finally discussed in-vitro fertilization.
Strong Woman: That's right, kids. Many women today make the choice to have children without a man in their lives. They can have their eggs fertilized by an unknown person's sperm in a lab.
PC Principal: That's right, Strong Woman. In today's society it is wrong to just assume that a pregnant woman had intercourse with a man.
PC Principal: St-students at this school need to be careful because it can be offensive to ask questions like "Who's the father?"
Strong Woman: I'm fine!
Mr. Hankey: Oh, I'm sooo sorry. I took Ambien two nights ago and I called the schoolkids homos.
Mr. Hankey: Oh-oh Jeez, did I say that? Listen, if you're tired and you can't sleep, DO NOT take Ambien. Okay? Whew!
Mayor McDanniels: I'm afraid we have no option but to fire you as executive planning manager of the city council.
PC Principal: I'm just a co-worker helping another co-worker in need.
Strong Woman: Yeah, well, people might get the wrong idea! I have worked my whole life to be the strongest woman possible, a person little girls could look up to. If those girls thought I was the type to get knocked up by my boss-
PC Principal: I certainly do not want to put an pressures on you as a female, but at times I wonder if there is more we should discuss.
Strong Woman: There's nothing to discuss! I made a mistake and I am MOVING FORWARD!
Mr. Hankey: My civil rights are under attack. They can't just fire me from the Christmas show! The whole thing is my creation!
Male Lawyer: Uh, last night you tweeted "The city council can suck my Mexican dick."
Female lawyer: You want us to take this up against Ambien? They have the best lawyers in the world.
Mr. Hankey: And I never ever would have said those things about the city council, but the Ambien makes me kind of blackout.
Mr. Prewitt: I'm sorry, sir, but we don't represent pieces of shit.
Mr. Hankey: And I just thought maybe we could convince the city council to hire me back.
Kyle: Mr. Hankey?
Kyle: What are you doing here?
Mr. Hankey: Just tryin' to find some help. There isn't a lawyer in town who will take me. Wait a minute... You! You're the son of a lawyer. You have lawyer blood inside your veins! You can help me with my defecation lawsuit, Kyle!
Kyle: Me? What can I do?
Mr. Hankey: Please, Kyle. You're the only person left who can help me. You and me, pal, we are gonna fight the system!
Voice-over: Paging Dr. Bender.
Dr. Bender: Your vice principal gave birth to all five babies with no epidural. I must say, she's a very strong woman.
PC Principal: That she is.
PC Principal: Oh, dude. Bro.
Dr. Bender: Yes, cute little buggers, aren't they? Three boys and two girls.
PC Principal: I think it's wrong to force gender specification upon them at this young age.
PC Principal: What's that?
PC Principal: Doctor, would it be possible for me to... hold the PC babies?
Kenny: (What?)
Stan: Nnnope.
Cartman: Not getting that stink on me.
Kyle: He has a right to be heard. He's meant a lot to this town.
Stan: Dude, why do you keep defending him, Kyle?
Cartman: Yeah. You know everyone in town thinks he's a piece of shit.
Kyle: Come on, guys. We can't just turn our backs. How many times has Mr. Hankey been there for us?
Stan: Mmmm. Once, kind of?
Kyle: Look, he messed up, but I don't know if he deserves everything that's coming down on him. I wanna stand by my friend.
PC Principal: Vice Principal?
Strong Woman: My babies! Where are they?
Strong Woman: You shouldn't be here! People will start getting suspicious!
PC Principal: Look I was the one who abused my position and took advantage of a subordinate-
Strong Woman: Nobody took advantage of me!
PC Principal: N-Not took advantage. You know what I'm saying.
Strong Woman: And I'm a strong woman!
Strong Woman: Oh yes, that curriculum should be fine for the students. I'll start working on an all-school proposal.
PC Principal: Oh yes, very good, Vice Principal. See that it is done by back to school night.
Female Nurse: A-hall right, Mommy! Your little bundles of joy are here. Oh! And who's this?
PC Principal: I am the manny. Anyone have a problem with that?
Female Nurse: No, not at all.
Mr. Hankey: Y-es. That was a bad attempt at a Christmas joke.
Mr. Waithouse: But there's nothing in that statement about Christmas.
Mr. Hankey: That's what I said: it was a bad attempt.
Mr. Waithouse: What part of the statement was actually-
Mr. Hankey: You wanna hear a good Christmas joke?
Mr. Hankey: Sorry, I got the sniffles.
Mr. Waithouse: Mr Hankey, do you understand how important these statements are to the citizens of this town?
Mr. Hankey: All I understand is it's only eight weeks until Christmas! If we don't stop wasting our time, we're all gonna miss out on the most magical part of the whole year!
Strong Woman: It's okay. Shhh. We just need to get some diapers. Shhh.
Strong Woman: Thank you.
Strong Woman: Oh no, no, they're not very PC at all.
Man 1: Awww, look at the PC babies!
Strong Woman: They actually aren't PC.
Strong Woman: Oh God, shhhh, nonononono. Sheee.
Man 1: Oh Look! More PC babies!
Woman 1: They're everywhere!
Strong Woman: I told you we need to shop separately! Sh! Shhh!
Man 1: Shhh! Quiet! There's PC babies!
Kyle: It's October!
Mr. Hankey: And that's the point! Don't you see? What we need to do is get everyone in the Christmas mood! We can bring the whole spirit of the holidays early!
Mr. Hankey: Nonono. Kyle, you gotta help me! I can't do this alone!
Kyle: I have homework and stuff!
Mr. Hankey: You're all I have! Even my wife left with the Nuggets 'cause of all the pressure! Please!
Kyle: Okay, fine! I'll help you. But listen to me: I don't care how restless you get tonight, NO AMBIEN!
Mr. Hankey: Well, maybe just a little if I really can't sleep.
Kyle: No! None! If you want my help this time, you aren't taking any Ambien tonight. That's the deal!
Mr. Hankey: Yay! It's a deal! Oh boy, Kyle, I'm so excited! We're gonna bring the spirit of Christmas to South Park!
Jogger: Oho, look at the little PC babies!
PC Principal: Oh, no, we're from uh, Missouri.
Woman 2: Ohh, PC babies!
All: Oohhhhh!
Mr. Mackey: Allright, thanks for comin' in today to discuss your daughter's behavior, m'kay?
Randy: Exactly what kind of trouble is Shelley in, Mr. Mackey?
Mr. Mackey: Well, unfortunately, we found out our playground monitor has been accepting favors to look the other way at recess, and uh, your daughter sent him an inappropriate picture. Of her butthole. M'kay?
Mr. Mackey: We've been havin' a lot of issues at the school with kids vaping lately and, uh, they bribe the recess monitor however they can.
Randy: Jesus Christ, how much worse can things get around here?!
Sharon: What do you mean?
Randy: I've had it. School shootings, pieces of shit taking Ambien and tweeting, priests raping kids, and somehow... I'm not laughing anymore. Let's do it, Sharon. What I've always talked about. Let's get out of here. Go buy a farm and live off the land.
Sharon: Are you being serious?
Randy: Never been more serious.
Sharon: How will we make a living?
Randy: By growing things and, and selling what we make with our hands. We can do this, Sharon. It's time.
Stan: Yeah, it takes me like an hour to get to school now. It sucks. All because Shelley bribed the playground monitor to let her vape during recess.
Kyle: Why would your sister wanna get addicted to those things?
Cartman: Well, your little brother does it too, Kyle.
Kyle: What are you talking about?
Cartman: You didn't know? The Kindergartners are like the biggest vapers at this school.
Kyle: Ike! Ike, do you have a vaping pen?!
Ike: Oh, come on! All the kids are doing it.
Kyle: Why do you want nicotine?!
Jenny: Do you know how hard it is being a kindergartner? We need a break sometimes.
Kyle: These things are bad for you! Do you understand?! Bad kindergartners!
Randy: Mornin' Joe? How's the farmin'?
Joe: Doin' good, neighbor! Just planted some Purple Skunky Kush. Harvested the Super Hindu Haze last week.
Joe: Well, see ya 'round, neighbor!
Kyle: That's gotta be him.
Stan: What are you gonna do?
Butters: Oh, hey fellas!
Butters: What are you guys doing?
Kyle: Butters, are you selling vapes?
Kyle: WHAT?!
Butters: Tropical passion. It's like mango and kiwi.
Stan: Butters, do you understand this stuff is an epidemic in our school?!
Butters: Yeah, and at five bucks a pop, we're gonna be rich!
Sharon: Randy, I think we need to have a talk.
Randy: Name is right there on the sign. Come on back!
Randy: Now, what about the Tegridy Jungle Bud?
Randy: Yeah?
Towelie: Whoa.
Randy: Yeeahh?!
Towelie: I don't know what Tegridy is, but... that is some good shit!
Cartman: I had to!
Butters: I thought we were partners!
Cartman: Butters, next time when Kyle walks up to you and says "Are you selling vape stuff," you say "No, I am not, Kyle."
Butters: You punched me in the face!
Butters: Well what's that supposed to mean?!
Butters: Well, I don't know how this means you can go and punch me in the face-
Vape Rep: Is this Teh-gridy Farms?
Randy: Yeah, name's right there on the sign.
Vape Rep: Our company is interested in your product. We'd like to do some business with you.
Vape Rep: We're one of the top vape companies in the state. We'd like to add your product to our line.
Vape Rep: Pussy sticks?
Randy: Yeah, you know. Penis pens, wussy vape, lady joints. Not on my farm, no sirree.
Vape Rep: You got a problem with vaping? It's cleaner and healthier than traditional smoking!
Randy: That's nice. Now how's about you take that pussy stick and get off my farm before I shove it up your ass and you're blowin' mist out your butthole?
Vape Rep: What happened to your accent?
Randy: Go vape some more, ya fuckin' puss!
Kyle: I need to speak with the principal.
Ms. Blaze: Okay, what is it regarding?
Kyle: I'd rather just talk to him.
Cartman: Oh, hey Kyle.
Butters: Hi, Kyle!
Cartman: What are you up to?
Kyle: Don't touch me!
Kyle: Don't- touch me!
Kyle: You're selling it to kindergartners!
Cartman: Kindergartners need a break too, Kyle!
Butters: You know they took away their nap time.
Kyle: You're such penises!
Kyle: You're so full of shit.
Cartman: Come on, Kyle, we all make mistakes. Did you already forget last week? You know... Ronan Farrow was here asking about you.
Kyle: Ronan Farrow? No he wasn't.
Kyle: Fine. But no more pushing it on little kids! You got that?!
Randy: Whatcha doin', Joe?
Joe: Oh, hey Randy. We uh, we sold the farm.
Randy: Just like that, huh? You gonna let those people with pussy sticks take over everythin'?!
Joe: Yeah. They paid us great. My wife and I are gonna move to Maui!
Butters: Yeah, I wish I had a little pick-me-up! Somethin' fresh and fruity to go with my lunch!
Kyle: Just stop. It's so obvious what you guys are doing.
Vaping Man: Oh yeah!
Vaping Man: I'm here to offer my fun, fruity flavors in a refreshing mist.
Cartman: Vaping? Hey, that's bad for you. Vaping's only for cool kids.
Cartman: Sure, Kyle. What is this about?
Kyle: Can I talk to you over here?
Cartman: How is this pushing it on little kids, Kyle?
Kyle: Fun, fruity Vaping Man?!
Cartman: It's marketing! Kyle, we have to make the money to pay off our dealer. How else are we supposed to do it?
Kyle: All right, how much do you owe the dealer?
Cartman: Why?
Kyle: How much?!
Stan: No, it sucks. I hate this. I wanna go back home.
Stan: I hate you so much.
Stan: No.
Randy: Come on, let's just see how it fits.
Stan: Pleaes, no.
Vape Dealer: There you are. You got my money?
Kyle: I'm just seeing if I can help settle things. You probably don't realize it, but vaping is a really big problem at our school.
Kyle: Okay, look, this is the money I've saved up from my past three birthdays. Can we call this even and end it?
Cartman: Whoa, hey dude! Why is there a dead hooker next to you?
Kyle: What?
Vape Dealer: What?
Vape Dealer: You just put that dead hooker there.
Kyle: Cartman, what are you doing??
Kyle: Oh shit!
Cartman: Get the vaporizers, and the cash! Get the cash, Kyle!
Kyle: Wha-what? What are you doing??
Cartman: Just get the- Oh shit! Ronan Farrow!
Kyle: WHAT?!
Sharon: Uh, well, not great. Uh, Stan got caught with a vaping pen.
Sharon: You know, those little pen and cartridge things with the mist?
Stan: It's not mine. I took it from a kindergartner.
Stan: What are you gonna do?
Kyle: Mr. Mackey, I need to talk to you about some things going on at school.
Mr. Mackey: M'okay, like what?
Cartman: We were just talking to the counselor about some college opportunities. What are you doing here?
Kyle: You know what I'm doing here!
Cartman: Okay, well, we really should talk first, Kyle.
Kyle: NO. Mr. Mackey, there's a big operation going on at the school
Cartman: Kyle, things have changed. You need to listen.
Kyle: Things are getting out of control-
Cartman: Kyle, listen! You want to hear this!
Kyle: -and you need to know what's going on!
Cartman: You need to hear this!
Kyle: What?!
Cartman: Kyle, listen. It's bad.
Kyle: What's bad?!
Cartman: The guy we tried to frame at the vape shop. He was the one the sixth graders got their shit from. The sixth graders are pissed at us, Kyle! We have to break into the vape shop and steal enough stuff to make the sixth graders happy.
Kyle: You guys decided to beat up the dealer!
Cartman: Yeah, but the sixth graders know you were there!
Kyle: How?!
Butters: 'Cause Eric told them!
Kyle: We are all in this together, Kyle! We gotta rob the vape shop, and then we can put this all behind us.
Butters: Please, Kyle! We still gotta pay people off!
Butters: Run!
Cartman: Aah!
Kyle: Aah!
Sharon: Randy, where are you going?
Bodybuilder: Hey! I like to vape. You think I'm a pussy?
Butters: Wow! You're so smart to think of a siphon, Kyle!
Kyle: Just shut up and keep pumping!
Vape Rep: What are you kids doing?
Kyle: Awww, shit!
Vape Rep: You little hoodlums break in through the window?! I oughtta break your little legs!
Kyle: Mr. Marsh!
Randy: Just what the Sam Hell you boys doin' here?!
Kyle: All right, listen. I should have talked to an adult from the beginning.
Cartman: Kyle, what are you doing?
Kyle: There are these three vaping syndicates at our school-
Cartman: Kyle?
Kyle: -and these guys are one of them.
Cartman: Nononononono.
Kyle: They had someone buying stuff from here for them, and then they sold it to kids.
Kyle: The sixth graders, these guys, and Becky Thompson are all at each other for control of the playground.
Cartman: Hello, Ronan? Eric Cartman. Yeah, hey.
Kyle: I was going to tell an adult, but these guys said they'd stop.
Cartman: So you know Kyle? Yeah, well, you're right about him.
Vape Rep: Didn't your mommy teach you it doesn't pay to mess with progress?!
Randy: Yeah. She taught me somethin' else too! If you're gonna fight for your tegridy, don't forget to bring a towel.
Butters: Does this mean we're out of the vaping business, fellas?
Stan: Oh God, this is just gonna get worse, isn't it?
Randy: Yup son. I think the fight's just startin'. Farmers like us are under attack.
Towelie: Yupper. We got a lot of work to do. We can't let 'em take what makes us special.
Voice-over: Tegridy Weed, from Tegridy Farms. Made... with a little Colorado tegridy. Comin' soon to a dispensary near you.
Mackey: E-scooters?
Mackey: Well where the hell do they all come from?!
Stan: So anyone can use them?
Cartman: Yeah, I think they just work with your cell phone.
Kyle: How?
Cartman: Kewl!
Stan: Aww, it wants a credit card number.
Cartman: Do you wanna use your mom's or my mom's?
Stan: Let's do your mom's
Stan: Is that an AmEx?
Cartman: Yeah, you want a visa? 8292 438 7766507
Stan: Espiration?
Cartman: 45261
Stan: Security code?
Cartman: How is it, dude?
Stan: Pretty stupid but sweet.
Cartman: What?
Kyle: We should use these things to trick or treat on Halloween!
Cartman: Hey yeah! We could cover so much more ground!
Kenny: (Oh wait, you guys. See, I don't have a phone.)
Cartman: Oh yeah, Kenny doesn't have a phone 'cause he's poor.
Kyle: Oh. Well, that's okay. We'll figure it out. We always do!
Lolly: How can I help you?
Mackey: Well I'm just gettin' my Halloween candy. Want to make sure I get enough. Last year I ran out and the kids egged my house, m'kay?
Lolly: Yeah, you don't wanna run out of candy on Halloween.
Mackey: I'll take three large bags each of Snickers Fun Size, Payday Bite Size, Almand Joy Snack Size, and Reese's Teenie Weenie Size, m'kay?
Mackey: Hey, c-can, can I ask you somethin'? Wha, what's up with all these damn scooters?
Lolly: Oh, I think you get an app on your phone and you can use them all over town.
Mackey: I just think people should drive, m'kay? I don't think people should "scoot." I just... I just hope the future isn't "scootin'."
Cartman: Great, cool. You got your pail.
Kenny: (Yup!)
Kyle: Kenny, we've been talking and, the truth is, without a scooter, you're just gonna slow us down.
Cartman: It's probably best you trick or treat with someone else this year.
Kenny: (But we always trick or treat together)
Stan: Yeah, but that's just it, Kenny. To use a scooter, you have to have a phone and... I mean, if we're waiting for you, we're gonna be as slow as all the other kids. It's... like, you know?
Kenny: (Guys, please.)
Cartman: Look, Kenny, I always told you that one day, being poor was gonna catch up with you. Okay? But you didn't wanna listen. You just kept on being poor, and now it's Halloween and you don't have a cell phone.
Kyle: Okay, okay. Cartman, that's not the point.
Cartman: He needs to hear this, Kyle. You know, people are just poor, and they think it's not gonna come back to bite them in the ass.
Kyle: That's enough, dude!
Cartman: Shouldn't have been poor, Kenny.
Jimbo: Yeah-heah! You got it, Ned! That was a nice shot!
Ned: Mn-thanks. I thought so too.
Ned: Mmm-no I have not, Jimbo.
Jimbo: We're trackin' a bear, Randy.
Jimbo: Where're you goin' Ned?
Stan: What the fuck?!
Jimbo: NNEEEEDDDD!!
Officer 1: Gonna finally get some R&R, sir?
Yates: Yep. Gonna go home and play me some Red Dead Redemption 2. I got a train to rob in Valentine.
Officer 2: Detective! Got a call from the school. Another kid's been killed.
Yates: No, no not another school shooting! Can't they handle it themselves?
Officer 2: Said they need us right away.
Strong Woman: Children, everyone, just stay back, okay? The police are coming.
Strong Woman: Oh thank God. Some kindergartners found the body. I-I don't think it was a shooting.
Yates: Jesus, it's a complete mauling.
Kyle: So what as he doing alone on the playground?
Cartman: Staci Nakabw says he just wanted to run back out and get his football.
Kenny: (What the fuckin' hell, dude?)
Kyle: And there were bear prints in the snow?
Kyle: You saw what?
Stan: It was at my house. There was a... thing. It attacked my uncle and took his friend. It was like a bear, but a pig... thing.
Kyle: Jesus.
Stan: It was at my house, and then here at the school! Everyone says that kid and I looked alike. What if that thing is after me??
Cartman: Dude, now you're just overreacting.
Cartman: Aww, what did I do this time?
Cartman: You go first, Kenny.
Kenny: (Fuck that, you go first!)
Cartman: I didn't even do anything wrong!
Kenny: (Neither did I!)
Cartman: Nobody gives a shit about Colin Brooks.
Yates: Oh yeah? I asked the kids in this school, "Who are the biggest loners? Who's most likely to rage and be the next school shooter?" You know what they said? The fat, ugly mean kid and the detached, loner poor kid.
Cartman: Hey, I'm not poor, all right?!
Yates: Or was it both of you? Fess up. I have people in Horseshoe Overlook who are depending on me to get provisions so we can head back east.
Cartman: You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2?
Stan: Keep looking. There's a lot of people saying they saw it, Kyle. It's not just me.
Kyle: "Evidence of the creature of South Park." This is like a conspiracy Web site.
Kyle: ManBearPig?
Cartman: You guys! You guys! The police are trying to say me and Kenny killed that douchebag, Colin Brooks.
Kyle: What?
Cartman: They questioned us for hours. They said they had enough to get warrants for our arrest.
Stan: But it wasn't you guys.
Cartman: We know that! What the hell are we gonna do??
Stan: Who was that ex-President guy? The one who showed up and tried to convince everyone of a ManBearPig?
Kenny: (You mean Al Gore?)
Kyle: Al Gore.
Officer 2: Detective!
Yates: Whaaat?
Officer 2: There's more dead kids. Out in the woods by Stark's Pond.
Yates: In the woods? There was a school shooting out in the woods? Outside of school is the one place kids are supposed to be safe.
Officer 2: They're saying it's really bad, sir. Need all units.
Stan: Hello, uh, we're looking for a government sort of guy named Al Gore?
Receptionist: Al Gore... Al Gore... Sounds familiar.
Receptionist: Ohhh yeahhh. This looks like Jim Turner
Kenny: {Jim Turner?
Receptionist: The state bowling champion five years in a row. You can always catch him practicing down at Gramercy Lanes.
Stan: Mr. Gore?
Gore: Focus. Calm.
Stan: Al Gore?
Stan: I don't know if you remember us, but we're the kids you got to help try and capture ManBearPig? Well uh, eh eh, you were right. Ha, you, you were totally right. ManBearPig is real and, uh, he's killing lots of people in our town.
Kyle: Please, Mr. Gore! We need your help! ManBearPig isn't going to stop!
Kyle: Please, just tell us. How do you stop it?
Gore: You stop it all those years ago when I freaking warned you and you still had time!
Stan: There has to be something we can still do. Please, Mr. Gore. You're the only person who knows anything about it.
Gore: Say you're sorry for making fun of me.
Stan: We, didn't, we didn't realize there were more than-
Gore: Say you're sorry for making fun of me.
Husband: You can't just go along with what people are saying, Susan. Okay? There's no scientific proof, no real evidence of a Manbearpig.
Susan: Well, there's a lot of smart people saying ManBearPig is real.
Susan: It is real!
Husband: You wanna believe it's real? You go right on ahead, Susan.
Gore: Aw, thanks, guys! You shouldn't have!
Kyle: So, ahum, now maybe we can all work together, huh?
Stan: Yu-you told us to do all this.
Cartman: You're still not even gonna help us?!
Cartman: You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2?
Stan: We know how.
Yates: I don't believe it. A school shooting at an ice cream shop. Damn it! When children leave school they're supposed to be out of harm's way!
Officer 4: Detective! Sir, we got word on the two suspects. They appear to be on the run.
Yates: I would be too if I were guilty.
Officer 4: No one has seen them or their two closest friends, uh, Marsh and Broflovski.
Yates: So we got us a gang of shooters, huh?! How the hell hard can it be to find four boys?!
Officer 3: Sir. Why don't you take a break, sir?
Yates: Erh.
Officer 3: You've been hittin' it hard. We'll do all we can to catch these kids. Go home. Play some Red Dead Redemption.
Yates: Huh. Gotta admit I've to love to see the sunrise over Citadel Rock again. And I got me a gal who claims she's got a side mission or two.
Officer 3: Go on home, sir. We'll take care of everything here.
Gore: This is it. Every piece of information I ever gathered on ManBearPig.
Stan: Where did ManBearPig come from?
Kyle: Is it some sort of genetic mutation?
Kenny: (A demon?!)
Kyle: What?
Gore: I should play Red Dead on this computer, with all three screens. That'd be so bitchin' sweet.
Stan: Why did the Devil send ManBearPig?!
Maggie: Harrison Yates, where have ya been?!
Maggie: I haven't seen ya in days. I've missed you so much. Come have some supper with me.
Yates: Maggie, I just need to relax a bit, all right? Please. I've been waiting for this a long time. Just give me a- Wait a minute. The house in Valentine is built? Where did I get a sniper rifle? Maggie! Did you play over my saved game?
Maggie: I just played a little bit.
Yates: A little bit, you-? On my saved game?! Why didn't you start your own?!
Maggie: You're never home anymore! With all these school shootings! I need a life too, you know?! ISo I robbed a lumber mill in Monto's rest, upgraded my horse and got a sniper rifle.
Maggie: Why can't we have a life together?!
Maggie: Where are ya going?!
Maggie: You can;t possibly go all the way back to the snow level again!
Kyle: Dude, come on. What are we doing?
Cartman: This is stupid.
Stan: He was right before.
Gore: We call upon the powers of darkness. Come on, guys. We call upon the powers of darkness.
The Boys: We call upon the powers of darkness.
Gore: Al Gore was right. Al Gore was right all along.
The Boys: Al Gore was right all along.
Gore: We should have listened to Al Gore.
The Boys: We should have all listened to Al Gore.
Kyle: Wait. Wait, are you videoing us?
Gore: It's Instagram Live. Keep going! We should have taken Al Gore more cereal.
Yates: Do you all have any idea what it's like to start over?! You walk four hours through the snow relearning everything, all because your bitch wife went and spent all your hard-earned money on upgrades you didn't want! I get one little break from work - one little break - and I didn't even get back to the first brawl at the saloon!
Satan: Who hath summoned me to this realm?!
Kyle: Dude! You summoned Satan!
Satan: What do you wish of me, Al Gore?!
Gore: A demon from Hell has been unleashed upon our world! We demand to know its nature! We demand to know its reason for coming!
Satan: There is only one place you can find the answers you seek! It is the place where all knowledge becomes known. Your local library.
Satan: Yes it is.
Gore: Then I command ye, Satan, to come with us to the local library! And I am cereal!
Kyle: Dude, Satan's not gonna go with us to the-
Satan: Very well, Al Gore. Let us go!
Satan: Yeah, guys! Guys, over here! I think I found it. What you're dealing with is a Sifter of Fate.
Kenny: (Well what's that mean?)
Satan: So there's these demons that, um, actually come once every few generations. They're all about making deals.
Stan: Making deals?
Satan: Yeah, check it out: "The Sifter of Fate thrives on tempting mankind. It will always offer a deal in exchange for mercy, but the carnage will be a thousand times worse when the debt comes due."
Kyle: Okay, so wait. Now you're saying that someone in our town made a deal with that thing?
Satan: Now it's here to claim its part of the bargain. It's sort of like when you're part of a gang feuding with a rival gang, you know? You ride around on your horse thinking it won't all catch up with you, but... it always does.
Gore: You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2?
Yates: Attention school shooters! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!
Cartman: Oh Jesus. You gotta tell them, Mr. Gore! Tell them it wasn't us!
Stan: That's gonna be impossible!
Officer 5: They're coming out!
Female Officer: Hands where we can see 'em!
Stan: No! Nooo!
Stan: Please! Somebody made a deal with ManBearPig! We have to find out who!
